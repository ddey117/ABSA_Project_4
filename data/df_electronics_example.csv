R17U6AU06HR16Q,5,Great product.
R31Y01GPXH7P64,4,work great sounds amazing
RG40FO7CNWOG7,5,Works tremendously well.
R2CI6TXIGZR6RU,5,THEY WORK GREAT
R37KF8VRBUZNQD,5,Works fine
RA8R84N9JMZLD,3,"My Dad loves this, only issue is charging, it does not make proper connection and he has to place something on headphones so they charge. I don't think this should be correct"
R2NB7PGJTPZUAB,1,Had this item 3 months and it no longer works.  Waste of money.
RJXYVQYSFYFVT,5,Just what I wanted
R2KGCZF402GV0K,5,great sound
R1KL6IIDB77A2O,4,I would not have paid the original price for these (about $200) because they are basically plastic and a little bit flimsy. I'm really not certain how durable they are.<br />(one star off for that)<br />...but at this lower price I'd say they are worth it.<br />They worked right out of the box and as described and are still working fine.
RTKB08FJST786,5,was very satisfied&#34;
R1Y35MXN8055J9,5,Works like a charm!  Just love the perfect sound after I take my hearing aids out.
R2AHSOYQURZM5X,2,"These are akward to wear.  I bought them so I could listen while working around the house - cooking, cleaning, riding the exercycle, etc.  Due to the design if I even bend over slightly they fall off and there is no way to adjust them.  Sound quality and ease of use is acceptable."
R12MK47HAZGBFQ,3,Poorly designed? Why the transmitter receives signal when plugged directly into a cable or satellite box and not directly into the television.  Unable to use when viewing blue ray movies as well.
R1ZUB8KAZQBHJ4,3,Some what touchy adjustment but once set works well
R17TX4USVAAEI7,2,The power plug from the wall unit would not mate properly with the receptacle on the rear of the transmitter unit.The plug would not fully seat down in the receptacle. A gap between the plug and receptacle was clearly evident. The power light on the transmitter would not come on no matter how firmly we pressed on the yellow plug. We tried twisting the plug while turning but it would not fully seat. I am very disappointed in this product and its manufacturer as it appears that a quality check may  not have been made before the unit was shipped. I have already shipped a previous similar item back because it was listed on a page with wireless items and it was not.
R14IRNBU0CFBPH,5,Nice Headphones.  Great value.
R25N5KMSGEYDS7,5,"i bought these headphones to be able to watch TV shows in the same room as my husband, when he's working and can be distracted by the TV sound. Our TV is outdoors, and gets signal from a cable box inside the house using wireless HDMI - about 30ft away from where we sit, and through the exterior cement wall of the house. After reading some other reviews, I was worried the sound quality would be poor and that I'd have to return them, but the sound quality is great and the lip/voice sync is better than with the wireless HDMI hookup. The setup of the headphones was very easy - less than 5 minutes to get the batteries in and connect the base to the cable box indoors. Overall, I'm very happy with them!"
RITVNUXNUN8IP,5,Excelents earphones
R2X5EP1XSOIZ0A,5,"I bought these for my mother, who was turning the volume on the TV so High, no one wanted to watch with her.  Now she can here and we can all enjoy our favorite shows to gether again.  Thanks"
R13RGCK6KS7JC3,5,"Bought these for y husband several years ago and they still work perfectly.  Read all the reviews on head phones, and this one rated high, and did not disappoint. He watches TV is front room and I watch in family room, Works for us and I cannot hear his TV."
R37TDCI38RVCFU,1,Bought for my husband to use with HDTV and it was not adaptable for our set.
R3QUSHJC7UTMKC,2,"UPDATE:<br />Easy to set up.  Hooked to TV so volume no longer bothers wife...  things were great for a while.  This is the second pair of RS120 I have had.  BOTH pair developed severe static problems.  When the volume or tuning wheels were touched or pressed or tapped the static would disappear temporarily, the headphones seem to last about two years... which is the warranty period."
R16IHU0VO1VWK6,5,Works great!
R2XXT8SGIC38NA,1,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FTVEK?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br />Good sound for sure.<br />However, the cord from the base to plug-in has totally disintegrated.  Little pieces of cheap plastic all the way down the cord to bare wire. To repair they need to be rewired.  I called Sennheiser and there is no recourse.  You must pay to send to them. Pay them to repair cord pay then for return shipping.  They do not stand behind their product very disappointing and expensive!<br />Would never buy their product again."
R11YZM6GJVDE6X,5,GREAT set of headphones. Crystal clear and very comfortable! Charge pretty quickly too.
R1EICG0YSHMC2G,5,"Love it.  Had no problem installing, and once the batteries charged It was excellent.  No problems so far."
R1WXTBLDBSEDOR,3,"I am giving this 3 stars with the hopes that people may actually read what i got to say. Do NOT buy this headphone set! I used for a day and packed it for a return with the speed of light. I am a musician. My ear is trained to sounds. The white noise you are about to experience with these headphones is going to drive you crazy. No matter what the frequency you set the dock at - that noise will be there, lower, or louder, it is there and does not go away. Another thing i absolutely hate about these headphones is all the wires that they take in order to function. When think wireless you don't expect a ton of wires. The dock needs to be plugged into an outlet. It is retarded. One would think the dock would charge and then function without being plugged in at all times. Think about this- wanting to use these headphones on your laptop- you have to tie down your laptop to the dock, which is wired to the wall making your laptop stuck at a very rigid position. Cant do much. Defies its purpose. And even if you lets say hold your laptop sitting right next to an outlet- there are wires all over you. The padding on the headphones feels cheap like an 80s walkman. These headphones also do not seal very well. Everyone within 3 feet radius will hear exactly what you are doing. And there is no bass. God, if you listen to anything with a deep bass, these headphones sound like they are about to fall apart. And of course, just like everyone else, i found the tuner nob right next to the volume absolutely impractical. Lets say you laid down on your couch listening to an audio book, if you moved a little too much, chances are, you'd hit that tuner and the clarity of the connection goes to hell. Last but not least, they are unreasonably stupid expensive for what you get. I paid an extra 10 $ and got a pair of studio AKGs that come with a 3 meter cable instead. Best decision ever. Just like these were the worst decision ever. Sennheiser have another pair thats like 29$ and that pair is notwireless but it is miles better more durable and sound efficient than these disgusting waste of money headphones."
R1MB8MM4ZKC2FT,5,Met or exceeded all my expectations.
R2NUW4HBCDVRAN,5,Just as described works  perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends
R2TH52QXMLA6FC,5,These are perfect to keep from disturbing the neighbors.  I can walk to the mail box and not miss any of the audible books or baseball game.
R3EX9Z72JZ079Q,4,Works fine. Please be advised you may need an Analog Audio Decoder and optical cable at an additional cost of about $60 if your TV has WiFi and other features
RMV9VEFY6DZUL,5,"Great sound. Easy to use. Love the wireless charging.  For price, they're great headphones."
R2RMM8RC53NWGU,5,Great!
R3C8L2B8OUNV7S,5,Finally can understand English and Scottish dialogue on PBS shows. These are great and no disturbing others.
R1OH4W69Z5MFGQ,5,Good quality
R2DAFRTD2U7E80,5,"I love it , it's perfect!!"
R2QITH6TW0T1PE,5,Could do with out THEM. We have 3 pair. ALL ARE GREAT..!!!!!
R3FHJ8EWKTR4XP,5,"Excellent, traffic sound,"
R1ASLY0LV08915,5,"Great item. Husband is hard of hearing and he can turn the volume up as loud as he wants, and I can have the TV on at a lower volume & it keeps us both happy. Love it."
R9CIU8HPNKZNZ,3,"I have had these now for about a month or so. At first when I read the reviews about these head sets falling off your head, I almost did not buy them.<br />I went ahead anyway. Well, at first they where hurting my ears after a little while big time, and I confirmed, that they do slide off my head if I bend over a little.<br />I was going to turn around and send them back. But, I adjusted the the tightness over my head by extending them to the max and my ear pain pressure when away. They still slide off my head.<br />Why then am I keeping them? I like the distance that it still picks up as I walk outside my house. My mail box is about 120 feet or more away, and it still picks up the signal. That is what I like most about this unit. I did not want to take a chance on another brand with less rated distance.<br />Another thing, my wife is totally jazzed because I have a hearing loss, and I no longer have to crank up the volume for my tv so I can hear.  So. I am putting up with the sliding off my head and living with it, I am very active and do a lot of stuff and like listening to the news while I do other stuff around my yard and other areas around my house.<br />The 4 stars is due to the sliding off my head. Otherwise I am very happy with this unit."
R1QBVAH24TH11N,5,"Much better than others.,  like the long range capacity with no static"
R1N1KZMV9HCQPZ,4,"The headphones usually work great - except for the one time when they completely lost sound for nearly a minute, with no determinable reason.  I am also very disappointed that I have to turn the TV around and plug them in every time I want to use them, as they cut all sound from the TV, and according to the TV manufacturer (Element), there is no way around this issue."
R2Z0RORIQKBP7Q,4,"Practical, nice looking and efficient.<br />By the way, I ordered two sets by mistake. In order to keep both,, by not returning one set,Amazon offered me a $10.00 credit for my next purchase. I need a confirmation of this offer.<br />Thanks<br /> Eduardo R. Acle, M.D.<br />aclesrmd@att.net"
R20F1DA058OY7K,4,Excellent Quality Sound. Controls on headset could be larger for easier operation.
R27VGF80ZK4G1Y,5,"I have had no problems at all with the headphones.  I read other reviews that said they got nothing but static and when I first set the headphones up, I thought oh-oh, static......  Then I adjusted the tuning dial and voila, perfect reception.  They are comfortable on my ears, although a bit of discomfort when they set right on where my glasses go over my ear.  When I adjust them slightly, that goes away.  As for clarity, I am not an audiophile and these aren't Bose, my hearing is bad, ergo the headphones, but I am certainly satisfied with the sound quality.  I 've had them for about a month and am completely pleased with my purchase.  I can now distinguish conversation in movies where I used to just hear garbled noise."
R1RF8XJUQ9DT25,5,This product was purchased to allow my wife to watch TV in the bedroom. Sound quality of the phones is really good for the price point. Functionality is great with the rechargeable batteries working well and providing ample power for multiple years even given daily use.
R1KQVX7V56AHO7,5,Great sound!
R3UH6JAA5NRDWK,5,"These are great, no more batteries and we can both use our earphone off one unit."
R27DPB5OAHA40S,5,One of the best headphones.
RV82Y1874H4MK,5,Excellent audio for your TV or Stereo and the Headphones are comfortable to wear for hours at a time...
R3C069XVAMM7T4,5,"One of the best investments I've made in a long time.  They work perfect for a hard of hearing person-hearing aids aren't much help with hearing TV, but with these, you don't miss a word.  Wonderful product.  Worth every penny."
R169009GUTBPI7,5,"Excellent quality headphones, would highly recommend them!"
R5QUU3NPZC3EF,3,Hurts my ears and head.  Batteries don't recharge as I was told.  Have to change the rechargeable batteries often.  Expensive but not worth the price.
ROXEW471JCWAF,5,Just what I expected. Very happy with my purchase.
R2X6DHZ76EB80N,4,Works very well so far.
R10202XP3E4H0X,5,These are wonderful!  I had been having trouble understanding what was said on my TV without having the volume too loud.  The headphones have solved that problem.  They are comfortable and have quite a long range.
R1K55L17ZM0JIQ,5,It is great and I can listen to the television without disturbing my husband's Nap!
RQRIUI9KHLD7Q,1,Ordered this for my dad the jack was shaped wrong had to go get a new one then it quit working after like 10 min of use this was expensive to not work
R1SW3EXLMX9U60,5,I purchased these last Christmas for my stepdad.  I knew nothing about them and purchased strictly off of customer reviews.  So glad I did.  They keep a charge and don't loose the convection.  He loves them!!!
R2NG1KM6DN15P0,5,Good tone. Clear
R3MSBSKYT8VR1Y,5,Wifey here. These headphones are the bomb-diggity! The sound quality is terrific - very clear. The headphones are super comfy and fit very well. The wireless capacity is strong. I can be in another room at the other end of the house and there is no distortion. For the price I'm really impressed. Another benefit is the sound doesn't blast through the headphones so you won't disturb your mate. Really a great buy.
R1D62B48SOXGO5,5,Wife uses them to watch late TV while I sleep.  Sound it excellent and holds a charge great.  Hang them up in the morning. Ready for another evening.
R16AD49MV6UUK3,5,Came in a timely manner.  Work great and would recommend
R2HNTIC9TN30NK,4,"The sound quality of these headphones is crystal clear with little to no interference, even two rooms over. They produce crisp highs and head rumbling lows. The only problem I have with them is the head band doesn't fit as uniformly as I had hoped it would. Before these I was using a pair of Sony wireless headphones that spoiled me with hours of comfortable listening. All in all I am happy with my purchase and I think you will be too."
R3RB7BEF1WBS23,2,"I work in an office with a lot of electronics - so this review may be slightly unfair.<br /><br />If you're in the same boat as me and you're an engineer or something related working around a lot of equipment then this is not the headset for you. It's impossible to have static free listening. There's always a slight crackle, pop etc. while listening and it drives me crazy. I find I spend more time being annoyed than actually enjoying the music I'm listening to while working. Other than that the headset is comfortable and has a great charger. It's really unfortunate they're so awful in my office."
R8MCCIDZ663WX,2,Cheaply made and poor sound quality I couldn't get it to work had to return it
R2FD38GEV0DI7O,5,These are almost 10 years old now and they work as good as the day I bought them. LOVE THESE AND THE SOUND GREAT!
RXNMBCL8EMO6T,5,These headphones are wonderful. My husband has some hearing loss and he can hear the TV perfectly with these headphones. They block out the background noise. They are definitely worth the monty.
R3TEOCIXQB6UFW,5,"Took a bit to figure these out but worth it.<br />Has different channels and tuning in.<br />But I'm glad I am patient and not my husband.<br />It wasn't like it took a long time to figure out what I was doing wrong but quality of sound is great.<br />I wanted them for the kitchen, my husband has his TV loud and I didn't want to have mine up loud also but it would make cutting in and out sounds. Swishing sound. But love these in the bedroom"
R1I0JUIE12NYUT,5,I have been very happy with this product. Easy to use. I can watch tv with mom who usually turns th volume up To the point I want to leave the room. Now we can both watch tv at comfortable volumes. Her complaint used to be she couldn't understand what people were saying. With the headphones she can hear and understand them them. I bought another pair for my friends' mom who just loves them.
R9VN09Z48B2L9,4,"Good product, good prce"
RN46M9299TCNN,5,My husband loves these.  He is an early riser and I am a night person. He walks all around the house and outside listening to TV and doesn't disturb the rest of us in the morning.
R2K7ZYSZHQUJZG,5,Great headset for price
R71PTUZSKQK1Q,5,"Great headphones, clear sound and work great with TV.  Great quality for the price also."
R14X5RX9UA2YTW,4,Have not been able to make this work. Would not buy them again
R1LRHG7GNJPPAV,5,"Bought this with the &#34;Sennheiser HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System&#34; for my dad for father's day.  With a lot of grandkids always at his house and playing, he likes to complain that he can't hear the dialogue on his TV shows.  After trying this out he loves it.  He even said that he can hear ten times more with them, things he never heard before, and that the dialogue is crystal clear."
R56TCFISAFJNN,5,Works great and the best thing about it is that my old headset works with it also.
R1ZYD0178F4XQV,2,"I bought there to listen to my TV at night. Sound signal gets cut very easily. And they are kinda bulky. Better if used for the office. Not the best option in a bedroom.<br /><br />- - - UPDATE 2016-01/11 - - -<br />After over a year of use, I moved these to my office. I originally purchased them for my bedroom buy they fall from your head very easily if you're in other position than seated or standing.<br />At the office I tried to hide the base/transmitter behind a 24 inch display, but it interferes too much and I can head a bad &#34;hiss&#34; that makes the sound terrible, even 3 feet away from the base. Seems like you need a direct visual lime between the transmitter and the headset with no obstacles in between at all.<br />Finally and the worst about this headset, is that it has a Radio receiver built in. For some reason, if you're listening to something and you pause the audio, the headset will assume that you're not using your regular audio anymore and after 180 seconds it will automatically switch to radio mode, probably giving you a horrible and loud hiss of static.<br />This makes the headset really annoying."
R13MARFV9KR629,5,"Setup easily, sounds great!"
R3L861VUGN1L4T,4,great
RMIRHCB68VAF3,5,"These Headphones really do what they claim they will!!  Even in shows where people whisper to one another, the sound is crystal clear, so no more missing 1/2 of whatever TV show, DVD or what have you.  Not enough words to describe the huge and wonderful difference.  It come with and on/off switch on the left ear and volume and tuning wheel on the right side, to bring it in to perfection.  There is also a channel switch on the base to assist in perfect sound.  The only draw back we have found is that you can not talk to one another during commercials unless the TV is paused or the one wearing the headphones, takes them off.  Not a biggie for us."
R1LFBH887P9W5Z,5,This was a great purchase! Hubby loved to have the TV super loud. I couldn't even hear myself think sometimes. I orders him this and now we can have the TV at a normal level and he can have it as loud as he wants through his headphones. The sound quality is good for the price.
R25RTVXWB19OO9,5,"Great , can listen in peace!"
R2JV5AWJBZ0SY3,1,"Very uncomfortable. Poor sound, and I found it difficult to setup. Huge waste of money!"
R2Q7V8HY45QPO,3,This works okay. The audio quality is not as good as I thought it would be. When I can get clear reception the volume level is low. I find a lot of noise when searching for clear reception. I don't use it very much so it is acceptable but I was expecting better especially for the price. I like to use it when I'm riding my exercise bike. The noise from the bike can be significant when trying to listen to music so I expected better isolation and volume. It's satisfactory but not a full recommendation at this time.
R3TFQ8JYX140PD,5,Love it.  Easy to set up.  Everything I needed was included.
R33V4BNAVO10OP,5,Very good Important to watch youtube video to install....
R3F79SIMY4CY8R,5,Excellent hearing device.  I now know what is being said on the programs.  Had been missing a lot.
R3K41FE49FANLY,5,It's great!!
R1LTK7QMV2PE5P,5,I bought these for my elderly Dad after his other ones broke. He LOVES them. He can walk around the yard or house and still hear his programs.<br />they are easy to install and use.
R3II06WPY150D7,4,"I bought 2 earlier this year. They work great until they fail. One of them lost sound in one ear. The sad part about that is this one I used less than<br />the other one. In fact, I may have used that one only about 7 or 8 times through a 7 month time before it went bad. But overall I think they work<br />great, especially since I do not have any wireless TV's, so I was forced to use an RF unit. So that is why I decided to replace the broken one. I am<br />pleased with their performance."
R1S3JFLSZC2L5Z,5,"Yes, my husband loves them. This is his second pair. He has two of the Sennheiser RS120 on Ear Wireless RF headphones. Highly recommend them."
RRZ2NM7OIAS8S,3,"Simply wouldn't connect and work for me. I think there is interference in my condo, so my opinion shouldn't be regarded."
R22WXDRI1OWI5L,3,"Is a good product, the only concern is that the tuning sometimes is not very strong, creating a lot of interference while using the device."
R26DR5D8W1TYJP,5,"Great unit. Opened box, plugged in base unit to my TV, everything worked perfectly. Amazing sound, great bass response. Headphones were comfortable. No complaints.Would recommend to anyone with limited hearing or that needs to listen to music on the TV. The charger/stand works great. Just hang the headphones on the stand and it starts charging right away."
R3I3QCV7GOE8SK,5,I can now hear my TV programs nice and clear. Its fabulous!!!
R3B1JNT6935NWM,4,"Great sound. Easy to connect to TV (since I have dedicated audio outputs) and because of that, I love having control on the TV volume as well as the headphone volume (I can mute the TV while the headphones are in use).<br />One thing I don't like is the Tune control is right next to the volume, so my hearing-impaired son (whom I bought these for) has a tendency to adjust the wrong control. Being 5 years old, I end up having to correct the tuning for him. Sennheiser would have done well to put the Tune on one ear cup and the Volume on the other, but overall, these are great headphones.<br />I may buy another set for my hearing-impaired father-in-law. He's not 5 years old, so he can fix his own tuning issues. :)"
RFPNILZHOSCIP,3,They were great once I found the correct frequency... Then they stopped working. Not sure if it's the placement of the base or what???
R3HA1QUTWX5EJI,5,"So, so clear. Perfect. 5/5"
RH60E4812M2CJ,5,"Wow, I can't say enough how much I like these (and my husband). We previously had a Sony that our children killed with a laptop (it was mess).<br /><br />In comparison, our Sony was rechargeable, but docked on the bottom of the speakers, so it had to be carefully placed into the charger. This design is so smart, you basically just plop them on the charging dock and they balance easily and readily. The sound quality is pretty fantastic, and they are extremely comfortable compared to other brands that we have tried. I also like that should the headphones bite the dust, we can replace just the headset as this pairs with multiple sets! The price was just slightly higher than what I considered purchasing initially, and it was really worth the extra few bucks."
R2H1T2I8K4WR5T,4,these are great and now inexpensive
R1ND9TOKC9JQY9,5,"I purchased these for my mom and mother-in law who have a hard time hearing the TV and get tired of reading closed caption. They receive the seal of approval with both of them and they tend to be picky ladies. They have both commented to me how they even forget that they have them on. Also, no more changing batteries or worrying about them tripping over cords!"
R124YYZLA600Q3,5,"These are fantastic!  Before getting Sennheiser, I went thru at least a half a dozen headphones that did work very well.  All returned.  I've had these headphone for 4 months now, and they always work beautifully.  I especially like the tuning control since I have DirectTV and the sound comes thru the air - sometimes crackly.  I can fine tune to get good reception.  Although a little pricey, for me, they are well worth the extra cost.  As is said, &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;"
R1IXN4XD72LHMM,3,The headphones were more difficult to connect than my previous wireless.  Also did not find the quality of the sound great.
R39P8TBLCUUGC0,5,Work great.
R2IVLFY9BC474C,1,Stopped working after a few days.. we ordered Sony Headphones instead
R3EDK4R6ZKTG5F,5,"My dad use to blast us out of the room when watching T.V. . When we would talk... he would turn it up! Then commercials would come on and WOW! So loud! But not anymore thank goodness. My mom and I purchased these for my dad for his birthday. I plugged them in Immediately! So easy to do. I plugged it directly into the back of the cable/ satellite box. They came charged. I gave them to him, and he loved them. I've even used them myself from time to time to watch a movie. Sound is crisp, good bass sound. Great range..no static ever! Definitely would recommend for the T.V. Blaster in your home!!!!"
R1NUFS0SD0NRQA,1,"never got them to work, hired an expert.  But, of course by the time that got done. Past the time to return.  Now I am stuck with them."
R6N8UGEMLLJ6O,4,"Great sound, pretty comfortable, lite weight can't tell how far the range?."
R2RDNVZZSZ6DAX,5,"I originally would have given these headphones a 5+ star rating because when I first used them they worked GREAT and had EXELLENT bass. I dropped the rating to 2 stars because of what happened 24hours later. Prior to this 24 hour mark, The music and vocals worked perfectly out of both right and left sides. 24 Hours later however the music comes out of both sides, but the vocals only come out of the right side. I have no clue what happened. Now here is whats weird about this. It only happens when I have it plugged into my Stereo system Via the 1/4 adapter. When I plug them into my phone or computer using the 1/8 jack the vocals and music come out of both right and left speakers. I thought I had a defective 1/4 adapter so I went out and bought another one. The problem still exists. The receiver I use is a Onkyo TX-NR535 that I bought exactly 1 year ago. Prior to me using the headphone jack with these headphones, I have never used headphones before with my receiver.<br /><br />So if I would recommend these to another person: well Yes and no. I had a bad experience with them, but you might have a different one.<br /><br />Update: 2-12-16. I found the problem. I did something to my Receiver that made it do that weird sound problem. I did a factory reset and solved the problem. EXCELLENT HEADPHONES!!!!!!"
R3AADBG7IHOSO1,4,Performs as advertised
R2U9GHULSGFACL,5,"I think it is safe to say that wearing these headphones is akin to having two golden retriever puppy butts strapped to the side of your head.<br /><br />They are soft and warm, a little squishy, kind of heavy and capable of transmitting sound wirelessly over great distances.<br /><br />All the things that golden retriever puppies can do.<br /><br />The upkeep is much less involved with these headphones. I simply put them back on their charging station after a few hours of playing my favorite audio selection. They immediately go silent and begin the process of recharging until I feel like using them again in a few hours.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will be throwing out my puppies, having replaced them with these headphones.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am editing this review because I have owned these headphones now for more than four months. Thus far they have held up great even in the face of daily use.<br /><br />As an added bonus when I forget to turn them off after watching a video on Netflix or YouTube, the headphones will go from completely dead silent to blasting radio static in my ears.<br /><br />This reminds me to turn them off and has likely resulted in significant hearing loss in both ears.<br /><br />Oh well! Serves me right for forgetting to turn them off!"
RMFBXLQ2YEA3S,5,"This is great head set with easy controls. Typically battery charge last a week, great volume controls. A very good buy!"
R2KN3QR3DER92X,5,Good product
R1RQE59H8U2FL4,5,The ultimate solution for hard of hearing or courteous people who don't want to overwhelm their neighbors with loud noise from their TVs. One person can use the wireless headphones while the other person can control the sound from the TV for him or herself independently of the volume the headphone wearer selects. There is an impressive listening range. We even tested them out by going upstairs and still hearing our TV downstairs. Read that you can have more than one set in use and it's an option we may choose in the future by purchasing an additional set.
R3ID1T9MLPIV76,2,"This Sennheiser headset's tuning is controlled with a &#34;continuously variable potentiometer&#34; which must be set &#34;very carefully&#34; in order to hear the audio clearly; worse, it must be re-adjusted annoyingly frequently.<br />Other RF headsets like both the Sony TMR-RF985 and the JVC HA-W600RF have &#34;channel switches&#34; which are either in the right position or not.  Their audios are not perfect, but there is no re-tuning, once the channel is set."
R2WCA1TRXB0FJR,1,"Shipped the product overseas. When plugged it in, it didn't turn on. I always invest in good brand names products to avoid such cases. It didn't work in this case."
R2BRYC031HQWKB,5,"Have had for 1-2 yrs, and they are great."
R13Z9T1I60PY1Q,5,perfect for me
R2S61G6GZWYXL4,4,"It's great for watching TV when others are asleep, or when you need a boost in volume over the level others are happy with. The sound quality is great, the range is  good. I wear them to leave the TV room to do laundry so I wont miss any thing."
R27125RZ5S7LTM,4,Sound is good.  Earpiece is not concave to relieve pressure from the ear.
R2ZXF9EKWMCOO8,4,So far they have done what I expected of them.  Plugged them into the Atlantic Scientific box and I can increase the volume as needed for me and others can enjoy the normal sound.on the TV.
R1BUZY42O4J4D6,5,"Great Product! Keeps your partner happy when watching a program, as they don't have to listen to it!"
R7BI4IAFWOEDC,3,"Not as loud as I expected or need. Headset as others have said is loosey goosey and no adjustment. &#34;Tuning&#34; feels cheap. I haven't felt any tuning like this since the days of the little transistor radios. Having said all that, it has value. IF you have a spouse who wants to read while you watch a movie late at night, this would help. However, I bought this for use in my trailer at the lake. Just me. So I also ordered a Sound Platform from Vizio and compared the two. For me, with no need for a private device, the Sound Platform is far superior. Of course it costs about double but that was not a consideration.  I won't return this as I feel it is operating normally. I will instead gift it to a friend who can use it."
R14X7IFLWDDGR9,3,not any where near the 130 and much better than the botched engineering of the 170.<br />Sony is as good as the 120 and a lot less expensive
R1JE66IJ8681VD,1,.It makes the battery explode.<br />I was listening to the TV and am a huge noise by my ears like a bomb exploded battery almost lost the ear.<br />I had 12 month...<br />Be carefully.
R3FUADE1J3G5ZY,4,"Works great, little to much bass"
R1IOAHOH0248AP,5,"A year ago I purchased two of these headphone/dock charger sets. They were great for the first 8 or 9 months but since then they cut in and out, are full of static, and their range has dropped drastically. I will not purchase these again and do not recommend them."
R2OCVB2LGDRNJ6,5,These headphones were easy to setup and was a great buy for a guy who watches TV in the room while the wife sleeps an night!
R88ZX9VLZF414,5,awesome..works like a charm.
R17UDJ6J8BNTIH,5,"I'm a drummer and they fit my needs perfectfully;Sean Paisley,LPN"
R1CPI824IU61KD,1,This is the second set I have bought. The first set was fine for about 2 years and then the headset would cut in and out when using the volume control wheel. Annoying but still usable. I needed another set so I bought the same set a second time in May of this year and the base stopped working in July. I don't know if there is a warranty since I disposed of the box. I was hoping Amazon could help but their sight says I can't send it back. It will certainly be the last time I buy one of these units and I will probably buy direct from the manufacturer from now on and not through Amazon.
R3HW0VT5HWBBL6,5,"OMG! I have used several different brands like this over the years.  Nothing in this price range can compare to the high quality and comfort of this product. I can walk anywhere in my home, or yard (up to 100 feet+ away) and still get crystal clear surround sound and what awesome sound it is.  While these are not noise cancelling headphones, they are vastly superior to others like them and do the job of blocking most outside influences.  They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods and the rechargeable batteries last for hours and hours.  I charge them overnight once a week at most, but use them for 2-4 hours per day while watching tv with the kids and dog playing in the same room.  I highly recommend this product."
R3ML3R4VJTS5D9,5,"Terrific sound; easy to set up.  Makes dialogue so easy to understand.  And if I have to leave the room during a program, I still take the sound with me."
R366RYG3V1I1CV,5,I've been using these for several years. I almost completely detached one ear. Shoved it back on and that was that. I've dropped them and rolled over on them when I went to sleep. Just keep keeping on. Don't know about the specs or tech details. Just bullet proof for TV watching. Which is why I bought them.
R26GGTOCENLWCO,5,Excellent headphones and I can even use without removing hearing aids. A very good price for a quality product. Will likely purchase this product again in the near future.
R1MORTIJ4HFJ1F,5,"perfect for my grandpa. just put a pice of scotch tape on the tuning dial, and presto, no more out of tune..."
R1D5VUKC7UOJC6,5,"We just bought a townhouse for a summer home.  Back yard is so tiny that with windows open neighbors can easily hear our TV, so we decided headphones and bought a pair.<br /><br />We are very happy with them.  Prior to this purchase, we were thinking of getting more speakers for the TV but the headphone sound is so good that it would be a waste of money to get more speakers, etc.<br /><br />We also experienced the slippage/fall-off of the headphones when arising from a chair or other bending.  Kind of a nuisance but now we know to be careful and also wear the band a little more rearward on our heads.  Overall, we definitely do not regret this purchase."
R7MDYIIT69AC3,5,"Ordered this as a present for my husband. He loves it and it works great when the grandchildren are over and everyone is playing a different game on their tablets :)  Also, if he is watching a show that I don't care for, I can watch another one on my tablet and we can still  sit together on the couch."
R2BOD99E202BFN,3,Not easy to use.
R64Z1JSXL5J2I,1,"I bought this in May, and we three months further and it doesn't work anymore. It worked very well in the beginning and I loved the sound. Now there is no sound, just loud noise. I did everything, replace batteries, plugged in and out, put somewhere else, nothing worked. The distance between my bed an my TV is not more then 13 feet and still not able to use. I am so disapointed as this is the first time I spend this money on a headphone."
R2BKUNETJLZ4WB,5,"These headphones are the BEST!  They are lightweight and so easy to charge.  Don't mess around with cheaper ones, go for the best."
R3453VST33W6SJ,5,These are great quality and I haven't notice any static like the other reviews state. There is a fine tune knob that allows you to adjust the frequency and a volume control knob!
R2D2SKVRVWWI4Y,5,"This was a replacement, but so far it is great."
RGUZQ92VQG8DY,5,Works great.
R2OB9VQXDGX0L5,5,These work great.
R2HYVGC7UAKKZT,5,Works well and I use these headphones every night.
RWPG32I1XNCM8,5,We can hear very clear. I walked more than 100 feet passing  concrete walls and  I could hear clearly the National Geographic episode.<br />Sennheiser's Customer Service is Excellent.
R2GB9P95H34DQF,5,Great for your hard of hearing spouse.
R3LIYJLFJKEY95,5,"My wife loves this, cannot watch tv without it. We have had it several years and it's still working well."
R2URZ3EEF7EEW6,4,"Great unit! Great clarity. I've walked 50' to 60' from the unit and never lost the signal. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the headset is a bit bulky, otherwise I strongly recommend it."
R33WTZ7ATSQNOX,4,excellent sound and easy to connect...only glitch when you put on to charger stand the light is difficult to maintain and you don't know if it's charging or not
R29IMCLBUZER8X,4,They work fine for my wife who is hearing impared. She can remove her hearing aids and still hear well with these on.<br />I have several Sennheiser products and they seem to employ better quality control than most; something to consider when buying electronics.
R1UN7VL6454A85,1,Has continuous hissing sound
R1K99RTF3DTI1I,5,The headphones work great. They are super comfortable and seem to be a quality product at a very good price. I needed a TV headphone so I could watch TV while my wife slept. Just make sure your TV has an audio out connection in the back. It works for one of my TV's but not the other.
R1RCI6XOQ3D46N,5,Bought this for a friend and he is loving it !
R2VOHW17YCFCSP,5,Fast delivery excellent item!
R32RK0EBN0IIP8,5,Long distance reception...  Very clear... No static... Very Happy !!! :&#62;)
R2PZZASV0YCD5A,5,Sound is very clear.
R1XIBGCOQZBZYJ,5,"This is my second set of Sennheiser headphones for TV.  I liked the first pair so much (in my bedroom) that I finally bought a pair for my livingroom.  The reason I like them is the clarity of the sound.  If I turn the TV sound up enough so I can hear it (along with the neighbors) I still have trouble understanding the words.  With these, I can hear the words and music crisply so I can enjoy TV much more.  I can also go to the kitchen or bathroom and continue to hear the program instead of pausing it.  It seems to use an analog system so you have to turn it in and wait a few seconds sometimes but I quickly got used to that and I am very pleased.  Once installed, they are no bother, always seem to be charged and last longer than I can watch TV.  They are not cheap but I think they are worth the money because they are a quality solution to hearing problems when watching TV.  This second set I just bought was a refurbished unit that was in every way like new.  Thanks so much."
R3F9P8261J3YPE,1,RF had massive interference. Returned them promptly for a refund.
R11B63FB9PC8BW,5,These earphones are great. I can understand television voices much clearer. The reception is great at long distances. I can even follow programs 150 ft. from the receiver. They are well worth the price. The are priceless if one person is hearing impaired and the other has normal hearing. The person with normal hearing does not need to get blasted out of the room with sound. It is also wonderful for two people in a room when  one wants to read and the other wants to watch TV. Great buy at a great price!!!
RLX2KTIO82WXS,4,Can Get two Going at the Same Time and I only bought the one charging station and supplemental headphones.<br /><br />Four stars because it's hard/impossible to make it static free when tuning it. That's not really a big deal though for what I'm using it for. I noticed my plugged in $20 headphones sounded a tad cleaner.
R1MEQG4QW719AM,1,The headphones have horrible connection and makes LOUD static noise every once in a while and is hard to fix
RHSAYNWIVER2Y,5,My husband uses these In the backyard while he plays with the dog. They go the distance and the quality is great.
R2DXNTK5OCN2HK,2,"The earpiece is flat, and does not fit on the ear comfortably, it needs a rubber circle that provides more cushion on the actual ear.  It flattens my ear and hurts after minutes of wearing it.  It also has quite a bit of static, and sound goes in and out at times.  Would not purchase this again!"
R3CDA24CHA26LW,5,This was a replacement for a set that I dropped.  I am extremely pleased!
R3JZ37D6T84IB6,5,Excellent
R39266HVPXXPTT,5,Works great.
R3M9LKTCX4H8UT,5,"They are just great, much better from then the ones I got from Radio shack."
R1H7Z6OFSY5V05,5,This was and important buy for my hard of hearing dad... The fact these are &#34;RF&#34; makes them the best choice if you have a plasma TV.  This saved our neighbor and our hearing :) * Note easy to instal and take on vacation with you.
R1TQN8J2CFV8L,5,Awesome phones!!  I just bought my second set and I talked my friend into buying it and she likes it too!!
R2Q5H91X2S411K,4,"has good range.  previous experience with this item has me waiting for the downside to appear; corrosion on the charging contacts. eventually the contacts will turn green, and i will have to use a pencil eraser to get them bright again."
R6SV25H5EZOW0,4,works great just a little confusing when contrls areon bakside as when sitting in recliner it will mess with dials when you move.
R28NMUXR5L3G53,5,Works great!
R1SCRD3OOXZ3OM,5,Really good sound and easy set up
R2GNA8MDDFRM43,5,"I wear these when I am on the treadmill, they're great"
R3GSS8ZVFGZ2FP,4,"They could use some help in the comfort area, but are great for their purpose, which is watching TV in bed or on the exercise bike while my wife sleeps. It's worth mentioning they are manually tuned, not locked in digitally."
R1C1ZSPPUQW9QU,4,"With a name like Sennheiser you can't  go wrong in the first place!  I was looking for a basic set of wireless headphones nothing more nothing less wasn't looking for Bluetooth just a basic set of headphones and boy was I surprised!  I couldn't be more pleased ,  after researching many brands many models several different price ranges I settled upon these and I have no regrets.  From unpackaging to use took all of about five minutes the set up instructions were very simple I didn't even have to look at them to know what to do if you have never hooked up a set of wired headphones then there's no difference here.  I stumbled upon this deal on Amazon for 50% off,  I have a total of $70 invested and that included free shipping.  If you're in the market for a good high-quality wireless headset then look no more hit the order button and never look back!<br />The only con I have is the frequency tuner knob. I would prefer it to be a selector switch, but the analog style tuner does allow for fine tune adjustments, besides that everything else is so over the top it doesn't matter one bit! Order yours today!"
R2NP6UJRU3PMJO,5,Works great.  Very happy with this product.
RVNV9AOBP3771,5,"Very pleased ,better than i expected"
RXRPKHCO19X3T,4,"They sound good and have a decent range, at least since the last time I tried wireless headphones.  However, even collapsed to the tightest they go, they are a little wider than my head and don't hold on so well if I look down.  The surface that touches the ear is flat, so these are more on-ear than over-the-ear.  They also look too big when I'm wearing them."
R1E0SRXWLXODLJ,1,These do not work.
R2YQ0JNEY1W2ZD,4,My only complaint is they are a bit touchy to get them seated on the recharging stand.
R2G57K9M482ZXV,3,"The headsets are constructed great, my only issue is dialing in on the channel. I got these for my 91 year old father in law but let my 75 year old father try them. Worked great except the tuner button is to easy to bump and change the channel."
R3B1922OTD0R09,4,work great my second pair
RQ2G7XH0QHGCN,4,Good value - Works well - Fit leaves something to be desired
RKW2DW8QYNMM7,5,"This is our third pair of these in about 10 years.  They are a &#34;marriage&#34; saver.  Easy to install and my husband says comfortable to wear. He needs the sound on the TV  at about level 15, I am good at 9.  What is also nice, he can turn the TV sound down to 1 and the headphones will stay at his level.  We have taken them when we travel also.  We tried several other brands, but these are the BEST."
RJQI0MWGOVS3Y,1,Worked but would last for about 40 minutes and then I would have to charge it again.  Could not really used it.  Bought a Sony wireless headphones and it worked fine.  So I can't recommend it.
R3LQYRGSZR75VL,5,"These are TRUE marriage savers. My husband is a little hard of hearing, and he bought these at my request. Now uses them all the time. Never misses dialogue, and I'm not constantly asking him to turn the volume down. They are an Excellent -with capital E- value. (And how can you put a price on saving your sanity and your marriage, anyway??)"
R5S0L1KBWTYZN,5,"Perfect for using while watching tv, computer or just listening to music with a great sound"
RFMO2EKC3FC3T,2,"I cannot recommend this product due to the hissing sound. Despite changing channels and adjusting the tuner, the hissing sound will not go away.<br />However, I also have the Sennheiser RS-160 which is a far better product that is worth recommending."
RIWBINWLL858A,1,Mine are actually the TR120 model but appear identical to this  RS120 model.  I use  them at work to listen to radio via the web and am disappointed by the great deal of interference every time I move my head.  The fine tuning wheel has way too fine adjustment with just slight movement making radical difference in reception.  Can't recomend them.
R10HPS0QSVYKAR,5,This was order for a friend and they love it.
R28S87XZ4RWSAI,5,Purchased these for 93 yo mother in law whose TV blasted throughout our home. She loves them. The range and sound is excellent.  The only problem encountered was the tuning wheel on the right earpiece. My mother-in-law would inadvertently move it when she put the headset on and it would have to be re-tuned to the correct frequency.....a little tape over the wheel after tuning solved that problem.
R2V2XFXBI888A1,4,"I am very happy with these headphones.  Easy to hook up, good quality sound, good range.  Occasional, random electronic &#34;pops&#34; are a little annoying.  I wish they came in an &#34;over the ear&#34; style to further focus the sound and eliminate outside noise."
R2S850R41LSJFE,3,"first of all they sound great compared to my sony headphones.  so far the only problem is that you are wearing them while doing something else, say, loading the dishwasher, they tend to fall off my head.  this is a problem where every time i look down they slide off my head."
R4LWFI8BMC1V3,5,These are great I have had 3 sets TV ears an found the battery life very poor also they break easy
R17L7Z7ARMG11D,5,works great can listen to TV without disturbing my wife.
R3O4DQVLY8WWWE,5,This device performs exactly as the itinerary stated and as I had hoped. It blocks outside noise and the sound is excellent.
R3JJL12D0RZ8Z2,4,"Great clarity and quality of sound upstairs, downstairs or outside. Be sure to use tuner if you get static, read the manual because Amazon can't do any troubleshooting for you."
RX2UVRPSTD25M,4,"Outstanding, I'm replacing the same Sennheiser headphones that I have had for 8 years now."
REPCEYEXNWUJM,5,Bought to replace an earlier model of Sennheiser wireless HR headphones.  The quality of the previous unit is the reason I bought the same brand  A high quality prouct with great sound.
R21ML3GEONYW0C,5,GREAT SET OF HEADPHONES.
R13T9SOAXXM3FC,5,Works Great!
RGD3IHONLMXSC,5,Clear reception and it's pretty comfortable.  This is actually my second one.  My new kitten chewed up the wires on the back of the base.
R1CI5PDROHTZ82,4,"I use these while i run on the treadmill and have had no issues. I regret getting them just because of how huge they are, but really they work great and i am happy with them."
R2HZ3OE9H5XHGW,1,Piece of garbage. Died in less than 2 months. Inconsistent and staticy even when they worked.
R2YDC7RZYV6R9I,4,great item
R3N217RJ4D9PCP,1,"Too much static, do not work for us"
R3UKDAD9C2XR9J,5,Great product.  Because of these I don't keep my wife up at night while I watch TV and the sound is excellent!!
R1K6MNUCPI5AJO,2,"This model displayed on almost every page when I was looking for wireless headphones for TV. It got good ratings and the price seemed reasonable so I ordered it. Unfortunately, I do not like it and have sent it back. I was baffled as to why it rated so highly and why it was shown with such prevalence on the Amazon website. My guess is that there must be a higher profit margin for Amazon on this product. Ok, here are my issues.<br />1. These are not &#34;light weight&#34; headphones although that is part of the description. They are actually quite heavy.<br />2. They do not &#34;cup&#34; the ears well. Even in the picture it showes the part which goes over the ears is flat and there is minimal cushion.<br />3. There is a &#34;tuning&#34; dial right next to the volume dial. If you reach up to change the volume and you move the tuning dial by mistake, it takes a while to get it back in tune again. There is no way to lock the tuning. This was been a problem for me, but I'm sure that over time one would get accustom to it.<br />4. Too tight. The headphones fit very tightly on my head and there is no way to reduce the pressure. In addition to being uncomfortable, this also  prevents the wearer from hearing anything else, for example the doorbell."
R1WCBHA4YJLJOT,5,Just bought 3rd pair - one for each TV in the house. Great sound quality - can distinguish dialog that gets muddied by TV speakers. Provides peace and quiet for those not watching the TV.
R28YTGW1LNCJYY,4,"These headphones are easy to set up and charge. The sound is phenomenal. The only minor complaint I have is that they are a bit large. They have the propensity of slipping around or off of my head if I'm not careful. I wish there was a way to adjust them so they would fit more snuggly. Fit aside, you can't help wrong with these. They sound terrific."
RYFMMICAF60JE,3,Too complicated to operate.
RUZM7VT8966XK,4,"Researched several TV wireless headphones headphones. Originally purchased Sharper Image but the on/off button broke within 4 months. So I went back online to purchase Sennheiser brand because of the positive reviews. When I leave the room a short distance there's static. Therefore, the distance is minimal. They also slip off my head. On a positive note, they do cancel out all outside noise and they're comfortable."
RY4QKDV30G8SF,1,"These are terrible, and deserve zero stars!  I had them connected to my receiver and they made hissing and snapping noises that wouldn't tune out by trying any of the tuning adjustments.  Then they just quit. I don't usually write reviews, but I hope to help someone not make the same poor choice I did."
R1LYRDQ1OAAXE6,3,"After using this product for about 5 months it has developed a buzzing in the right hand speaker. It's rather annoying and quite distracting.<br /><br />Item ordered on February 15, 2015 and after March 2015 it was no longer available for return or exchange. Wow, all of a month guarantee?!"
R126M1COO3E0X3,5,"very low price price and quality is excellent , I would totally recommend"
R3ERKY7U19RTLW,5,Great  range & sound.  Light & comfortable
R2HQ55YMTL6AVW,5,Wow. Don't know for how many years i have these headphones but the sound is clear and they work perfectly. Saved my marriage i think....:-))
R1MAJM95O61TGY,1,"A lot of hissing. Put the transmitter away from everything, still hear a lot of hissing. I am going to return it."
R3MY5I9DXQTIWE,5,Bought these for my 93 year old Dad.  When he visits he turns the TV up so loud that we hear it several rooms away.  With these both our TV is spared and we can sleep at night.
R9YGQSKJ8SXN2,4,Works great and rechargeable  headphone batteries a convenience.
R1MMVPYA8J2LVV,4,These headphones work great.  Only problem is that they do not have modern inputs and my TV only has optical sound output.  So I needed a converter to make it work.
R2560J0HD8M669,5,2nd pair I bought.  range is far better than the $180 units I bought.
RKCBZL1YV1GXG,1,worked sporadically for couple of hours.Never got around to return it.
R22IR1SIZTMH9L,5,Really nice sound
R3G9HA5R5CCF5X,5,"These are phenomenal. Both my husband (80yo) and myself (72yo) are slightly hard of hearing. These work great. I had to play with them a little to get them hooked up, but it didn't take long."
R2L0YPBELT258U,5,This is my second RS120. My first unit was sat upon by a family member. I have a different brand in another location and the Sennheiser RS120 has much better features and reception than the other brand.<br />PS: I am more careful about leaving my unit on a chair now.  George Carpenter
R2IZBVC7U0ZP1E,5,My wife loves it.
R2V6N5AYJOZ4QT,4,really helps my hearing TV without having to crank up TV speaker volume and annoying others
R2TFG0C7VC70M8,5,"My son loves these and uses them everyday, he can hear his TV better with them from across the room perfect!!!! I was apprehensive at first because he is partially deaf in one ear but I was told that there are 4 speakers inside and provide a sort of base effect. I highly recommend these over Beats ANYDAY!!!!!"
R1TA5ITVM3ESO6,5,So far I've been very impressed with these headphones. I use them with my new UltraHD Smart TV when others in the house have to retire for the night much earlier than myself. The sound is great and I can move to other rooms with no drop off if I need to The only minor problem I've encountered is that they have only one hole in the back for hanging the base. Two would have made it more secure.
R18NNN5RD1RXUX,5,Love them.  Work great!
R1CF5ZEZ7500XA,5,400+ foot range although a little static with that much distance. good response and loud enough to overrule my mower. great product very happy. Covers my 4 acres.
R3TAX4RWPTOKMB,3,Noisy
R29BLYPHBM7RWK,5,Great for watching tv.
R1RC5HUSC2WTHB,5,Great headphones. Easy to install
R1PUILISX9U61B,5,Good product. My only criticism is that the POWER light should be labeled differently since it is not really a power light.
R110LQ2Y3E3VPO,3,"The sound quality is great and I hear and understand dialogue on TV clearly.  However, if you want to move around and do other things while listening, they fall off very easily.  For example, if I go into the kitchen area of our TV room and look down slightly to the counter top or sink, off they fall.  Had I realize this before, I would have looked for a different style."
R311ANV2XFU0R3,5,"These are the best ever - the purchase we made included a second pair, and we use them when watching movies, so we can each control the loudness."
RAZGIM9P8FYEO,4,OK
RZ8B0NF69BLIF,5,Work well and good sound quality.
ROKNBYEVBXF9N,5,Makes watching TV in bed at night not bothersome to spouse.
R29UNKAQB23YDW,5,Good as new
R2YMHNHTMHR8S8,4,Great value for money. This is the second pair of these headphones I've had. Thought maybe this newer model would not suffer from interference from other electronics in the house but it still does. When voice over IP phone is plugged in noise increases on headphones.
R3QWO0E31ASZ9Q,5,they are what I wanted and work great
RY2EVX46X5GB3,5,They are great. I.  Love it.
RB0M6O0TOLN39,5,"Over the years I have gone through a few sets of wireless headphones.  My last set was Sony.  Let's just say this: Sony makes so many different things, whereas Sennheiser makes headphones.  And they do right."
R1SL75TB2R5EIX,5,Best gift for my husband. The high volume on the TV is no longer an issue.  I even wear them at night when everyone has gone to bed.  Great quality and they work as advertised.
RSEJFR46GV2E3,4,Very good headphones. Sometimes it appear a bit of noise but it can be solved moving the position of the base.
RO17F5HNEJYY2,5,Perfect !!!!!!! My husband watches TV with these on and I can stay in the same room and read.  He does not mind using them at all.  I highly recommend them!
R3LJXCT4HJH0XS,5,The headphones are very nice and work perfectly for someone with a hearing problem or doesn't want to distract others.  They receive the surround sound.  The person(s) not wearing them hears TV speakers and not the surround sound.  There may be a way to hook it up differently.  I'm not knowledgeable of that if available.<br />Enjoyable!
R3RXSMPCFZA6TY,5,Great set of headphones.  Works great in my room when I want to watch TV late at night and not disturb others.  They work exactly how they describe.  Very easy to set up and the charging is an useful design of not plugging anything in.  I am very pleased with these headphones.  The only complaint I could have is that they can get a little static sounding when I am lying down as opposed to sitting up.  I can correct this by adjusting how they sit on my head.  That is the only inconvenience I have experience so far.  Other than that they are great and work just as promised.
R2LHFZLFKIIK01,5,Wonderful! Wonderful! Got these for my husband because he needed the volume up louder and louder. He now watches his movies with his headphones all the time. I even put them on while I'm on the treadmill (so I don't have to turn up the volume even more) and the sound is amazing. What's best is that one person can have the headset while the other can still listen to the tv.
R3MLLYZ1LO2QK,1,"I never could get sound to come out of both earpieces at the same time. Tuning the headset to try and find a way to make sound come out of both channels was an exercise in futility. This is not what I expected from expensive headphones. Also, they are not comfortable to lay down with."
R1XUBN6QAKT10R,1,"These headphones have a noticeable hiss that is very distracting.  I find myself constantly adjusting the tuning while I'm watching TV to get rid of the hiss.  Some people have mentioned that this could be due to interference. There is no interference, none at all.  I'm sitting all of 5 feet away from the transmitter, the audio cable is clear and not crossing any other electronics or wires. Even if it was Sennheiser should be using well shielded cables to to reduce this hiss. After all this is an electronic device that is meant to be used near other electronic devices.  It is not the responsibility of the consumer to part the Red Sea because Sennheiser wanted to save 50 cents on better shielded wires!<br /><br />Another problem with this is if the TV volume is low it will automatically turn off.  There is also no charge indicator to tell you how much you've charged it so if you forget you're out of luck.  One last thing about this thing is that on some nights I can hear ham radio operators or truckers or something with this.<br /><br />For as much as these things cost it is ridiculous how cheap they are and the low level of technology they use.  This is the second set of headphones I bought from Sennheiser, the first where the shark-fin earbuds, and both were low quality materials and poor performance.  I will never purchase their products again!"
R3DYT3MR82VSCH,3,A
R3LRFPIA0VDKKL,5,Love them...but one side broke:(  I do have some family members who are tough on everything & one of them must have broke this while using...but they still work - one side just dangles...
R3ORXPR7UVRC7E,5,"these headphones have literally helped my marriage. My wife and i are on completely different schedules. i go to bed early and she likes to stay up late. the TV was a constant source of arguments and aggravation for both of us. she wants to stay up and watch TV while i am trying to get to sleep. after months of this back and forth and her watching tv with her hair trigger remote volume, turning it up and down at every loud noise or commercial, these headphones were a god-send. She can now watch TV at full volume through the headphones while i am snoozing away under my eye mask. Plus, when i get up early in the morning and she is sleeping in she can just turn on the headphones and fall asleep to the TV instead of all my morning routine noisiness.<br /><br />The quality is impressive for the price and the sound quality is even better. Far exceeded any expectations i had. in fact, i will sometimes wear them during the day if i am watching something that i want to hear every noise or sound effect. the stereo quality is great and even better than our regular TV speakers. Highly recommend for anyone who has our same problem or for someone who is hard of hearing. i am thinking about getting these for my dad who's hearing has steadily declined in his older age."
R254YQAWKB7EDG,5,Got these for my best guy.  We can actually sit in the same room and watch a TV program together.  He loves them too.
RB4ZJXN6V58XF,5,I love them because my husband can watch tv in bed and I don't have to listen. This is our second pair of these headphones because my husband falls asleep with them on and he sort of bends them out of shape.
RT41EF5R61VUA,1,Did not work. The base would not power up.
R2USC9AAZFL0MY,5,"As expected! They are great!<br />Of course they are not the best headphones in the market, there are other Sennheiser models that are the best in sound quality, BUT they do exactly what I wanted them to do! For listening to songs, radio programs, TV, news, etc, while taking care of things around the house, are absolutely one of the best set of wireless headphones! Great value!!!"
R1D0PXQ9BBHFHW,1,Charging system did not work well.<br />Volume lowered after 2 min. then unit shut down after 10 min.<br />Returned.
R8QLX29BY6IN0,4,The head phones make watching movies and TV shows a pleasure.  The separation is good and the phones are easy to install and tune.
R1GU7KKHSB8JV4,4,Very satisfied with these wireless headphones.  I like that it turns on automatically when it detects a digital signal.
R17MAUCE837I8Q,5,"This is the BEST item I have ever purchased on Amazon!! After researching info on these type units, I decided to spend &#34;a little more&#34; and go with these!! So GLAD I did!! Hubby works crazy Law Enforcement hours and this way I can watch tv in bed and not wake anyone up ;) Great quality, Easy to set up and very convenient and comfortable!!"
R28XT5LPR5OP32,1,We had one of these before and it worked great..it was destroyed in a house fire.  Just bought a replacement and it has a major problem with shutting off after a couple of minutes..then it turns on again...some kind of problem with the base unit or power supply...  This makes it basically unusable.  If there was a way to contact the seller for a replacement I would do that but I can't find a way to do that.  please help..thank you.
R2LPL79BCYHLOB,3,"The volume wheel is right above the tuner wheel hard to get the hang of it,, plus the tuner wheel should have a detent so when you are fiddling around trying to find the volume you cant easily move it, they are not as comfortable as I believe they should be, My old ones (rocket fish) cupped around the ears, these just sit on the ear, I do like the ease of the charging tho just set it on the holder and the light shows charge."
R31SCQIEAKSN8R,5,"I'm very pleased with these headphones. My roommate bought the Sony TV set and the headphones are huge. These look large but they fit comfortably on ear and are not massive. Mind you, these aren't earbuds but that's not what I expected. The signal works great and I like that I can dial in the frequency as opposed to picking a frequency like the Sony headsets.<br /><br />My only worry is that this uses rechargeable batteries which are NiCad. NiCad is notorious for having a &#34;memory&#34; depending on my use as opposed to Lithium batteries. The upside, however, is if my batteries do die at some point or fail to hold a decent charge, I can replace them with any standard rechargeable battery. In addition, if I neglect to charge the headset and am in dire need of using them immediately, I can always drop regular batteries in these and wait till I can recharge the NiCads"
R2HZCGM9539OXI,2,The are cheap plastic and average sound. If any problems throw away
RFSV3RAOYQAK7,5,Have been using these for months and they work great. SO can watch TV in bed and I can sleep.
R252VVNH2U47Q1,5,Great for hard of hearing. Doesn't block the sound for others in the room. I can go out in the yard and still listen to my cd's.
RF7HVJUOJG9S,5,have had this brand before and loved it as well as this one
R393BLQLBDKGZO,2,the charge unit stopped working 4 months after use
R2KXQLV72T18ZO,5,My husband is hard of hearing and this works for him.  He can have the tv loud enough for him and it does not bother me.  I am very happy that I purchased it.
R1UCNMHB3Q2COZ,4,"I've only had these puppies for a few days and more than likely come back for a second review with in the first 30 days, just to give them a fair shake.  I replaced a set of TV Ears that gave out in less than 30 days and had to send them back.  They just quit working.......have no idea why.  I have four areas I'm attempting to cover......meaning I will be purchasing additional sets, once I'm satisfied with the product.  At this point, I believe this may be the best bet for those that are hard of hearing which I am (going on for over 5 years).  As with most products I purchase on Amazon, I read the reviews......The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly...........The first thing I would always recommend is attach these to a surge protector ( I do this with all my electronics....great protection and mostly the reason for failures if you don't).  The second thing I recommend is to charge the ear phones for at least 24 hours prior to use.  Now comes the  fun part.........These were not designed to plug in and go.  You have to put some effort into fine tuning these.  For starters, they have three channels along with a fine tuning feature.  In my case, I started with the hissing issue.  I then  went through each channel and started the fine tuning process.  I found two of the three channels had a &#34;sweet zone&#34; .  That's the area I look for to obtain the best sound quality.  The third channel seemed to work the best for me.  The only negative I noted during the first 24 hours of use was the sound dropped out....not sure what happened.  A lot of the reviews that I read complained about the headset falling off their head.  I wear a size 7 1/2 hat and I had the same issue.  For those that like this set with the exception of this issue, I would suggest investing in a sweat band that joggers use...that may resolve the problem.  If nothing else, I would suggest purchasing something similar to what one would use for eye glasses, only longer. ........ As with most electronics, these tend to be fragile.  Drop the ear phones or transmitter and, more than likely, that would be end of game.  If you have pets or small children/grand children, make sure you place the transmitter in a position to where it can't be knocked off.  When you're not using the head phones, I would suggest the same thing.  I honestly believe, if you position the receiver and head phones as suggested, along with a surge protector, you'll receive a long life on this unit.  I intend on coming back in 30 days for a final review.  Sennheiser products have a great name  This item has all the ear marks of being a 5 star.  Based on my past experience, if I'm going to have any serious issues, they should appear within the first 30 days.  At this point, I firmly believe this is a great product for those that are hard of hearing.  UPDATE (7/31/2015)  I'm starting to have issues with the sound dropping out and just getting a ton of static.  It's happened to me about 4 times now and it takes a while to return to normal (over an hour).  The green light goes out on the transmitter.  The headset was not touched......did this all by itself.  I attempted to change channels and adjust......had no success.  I truly love this set, but this issue won't work for me.  As the headset has two rechargeable batteries, I going to buy a new set and see if that's the issue.  The ones that came with the unit are charged every 24 to 48 hours.  Other than that, I'm not sure what else I can do.  I did have the opportunity to listen to a musical that was on TV and the sound quality was great, especially while my intent was just to be able to hear normal TV programs.  If I can get this bug worked out, I plan on purchasing two more.  I did drop this one star until I work though the issue.  UPDATE: 8/5/15.  I purchased a new set of rechargeable batteries from Amazon.  Since installing the new ones, I don't have the signal to drop out.  I hope this takes care of the issue.  I will continue to track during my 30 dayperiod.  I have upgraded back to 4 star with hopes this item will reach 5 star.  The sound is really great.  If the issue returns within the 30 day period, I will return and replace with the same model with hopes this will take care of the issue.  That would be a first for me as I have never asked for an identical item.  I would just move on to another brand.  The quality of sound and ease of use keeps me hanging in there."
R1IS3V1UZBO9R4,5,Got this for my mom and it has worked out well for her.
R3SLTKL8SEBVOV,4,Great sound. Shoulda made the base heavier Or screw it down.  But fabulous sound
R2TR1A2EALC8KA,5,Just what we ordered! Fabulous sound!
R3VAX96X91N6GL,5,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS HARD OF HEARING,HE USES IT ALL THE TIME.THIS IS GREAT."
R2S2Y4J7H8WYTB,3,Not completely clear.
R1LCVWSQJZOQLZ,5,Hooked it up to my TV audio out and it worked fine. The unit keeps the batteries charged.
R3SOX4AR0B037U,5,Now I can finally hear the TV using my hearing aids.
R36Z9TK0QN2JDV,4,It met all my expectations.  Thank you.  It was easy to find tune a program I wanted with no slippage during use.
R1BJYGXF1IL4K5,5,"I was taking some college courses and needed some quite study time, but my husbands favorite team was playing and he had to watch. Unfortunately we had to share the same room. After I purchased the headphone we can do just that.<br /><br />I can sometimes can hear a little noise coming from the headphones if the volume is high. The sound quality is good and clear. It fits comfortablely and there isn't really a noticeable difference in sound. My husband loves that he can still hear the game if he has to leave the room or get something to eat.<br /><br />The charging dock keeped them ready to use and out of the way so they don't get dirty."
R378IS27SRFVPD,5,"I bought these headphones for my 95 year old Mom. She is in assisted living and uses these in her room. They are lightweight and just need to be hung on the base to recharge. According to my Mom, the sound quality is very good."
R3AJJMQ1TKF5HK,3,Works ok has static
R3FL2F2QZP17FH,5,Love this product nothing bad to say.  We like that we can go outside and still hear what is playing on TV
R3DVALMK39RV2E,2,"Headset failed after 2 1/2 years, actually I only used them about 6 months each year since I stay at another location the other 6 months. One on the ear muffs lost sound. call the factory and they agreed that it no longer is working. Guessing this is Chinese electronics?<br />Will spend the money and go for a better brand next time."
RQ87NUUP06506,5,These replace a different mfg. and these are the Best.  They are easy to use and having a charger to put them on forces you to put them away (my wife likes that feature!) I am very pleased!
R3K9D2U4U2M4IL,1,this produch does not work well. I returned the first and they sent me a second one--I couldn't get it to work either so I gave it to an gadget specialist and he has had it for a month and he can't get it to work either. I won't buy anything from this company again
RIN5CG9KNG61X,5,It is a Great pair of wireless headphones!
R3SSGTPYHHH61D,5,Much better than TV ears.
R1OKT2TTQBX4IQ,3,Can't really rate them as we returned them.  Didn't care for the ear piece fit.
R1IHB6ZXPHY5K0,5,"works well, but needs to be replaced every 3-4 years."
R2LVVW5Y00HPDB,2,"I personally did not like the headphones. Firstly, I kept hearing a constant hiss sound and high volume. Secondly, they did not find exactly. Third, the ear cushions were not as comfy as I had hoped for. Returned them for the Sony headphones in the same price range and they were great."
R2DHXZLVC8YACO,5,Works Great!
R3I2LS4IF03JUM,4,"it really enhances the sound of the tv but doesn't quite block out all other noise.  It really does the job for someone with damaged hearing, very helpful. 11/13/15 Well this thing just stopped working and unfortunately I can't send it back.  I have only had it less that 5 months! So BEWARE if you buy it, how long will it last?"
RXF546GO82UXG,4,"Met every expectation for clarity, bass, highs, presence and ease of use.  No complaints here.  Would buy again if needed in a New York minute."
R3210OVW40RAJK,5,Great wireless headphones with a long range. Simple setup.
R28IDCRAAKUOU8,4,"These headphones are comfortable and have good sound.  The instructions are typical European with undecipherable icons and it's not clear where the channel switch is located on the headset.  We found you have to place the headphones on the charging rack very carefully, or the charger doesn't make contact. Also the red &#34;charging&#34; light stays on all the time when the headphones are on the charger, whether the battery is fully charged or not.  It would be nice if they had employed a bi-color LED that would change to green when the charging circuit is complete and the battery is fully charged."
R20CETSN3L2EEG,5,Absolutely love these head phones! I live in a two story Townhome and it keeps a good signal. The sound is great and so was the price.
R36ORLUIMPEJ4C,5,Great sound quality for the price and very easy to set up
R257Q719D6JK2H,4,They work well. They are a little loud to the others as they sit on your ear not all the way around it. I would recommend them
R3ITK2THUCAQTC,5,"they work very good, the sound is very clear, there are no batteries to replace"
R3HS82B5HH8TP9,5,I've had this for two months now and i'm very satisfied with my purchase. Sound quality is as expected from a very respectable brand
RZ19M4C6EBB6F,5,Bought this for my 91 year old father who was driving everyone out of the house with his loud TV.  This cordless unit with charging stand is work so well he uses it every day!
RWVBYS4G71I7M,2,Volume control to touchie
R2NVNOX59FK3ZH,2,Full ear cover so they get warm to wear
R3QH5NBRQDV9CK,5,"Love these headphones! They are clear as a bell! My husband and dad are hard of hearing, with this headphones our children can sleep.... Awesome!"
R31UQTV4CG0XMX,3,Unit works ok however the headphones rest on the ear and not around the ear.  After 20 minutes the lack of comfort is noticeable.  I would have returned it but cannot find the packaging.
R2GJD9T05REODG,5,Even better sound than just the TV speakers. You can hear things you never would otherwise. Great charging lifespan.
R2VHYOY3EAAJRL,5,I have had them a few months now  and I use them 3 to 4 hours a day. They are great.
R3URORAOZ51IW1,5,"These headphones work very well. After the headphones are charged for about 24 hours prior to first use, if you get a lot of static after you first turn it on, try adjusting the &#34;tune&#34; button a couple of times."
R2Y8P0LKU7Y8KH,5,"Just received this wireless headphone-charger base yesterday and I'm impressed.I've been doing some research on wireless headphones and Sennheiser seems to keep coming up  as a top brand.For $70.00 you cant go wrong ,really good sound quality,lite weight headset,easy setup I just used the supplied RCA adapter and plugged it into the earphone jack on my samsung plasma tv. It comes with the RCA audio cords already installed in the back of the charging base so I can also go directly into the audio jacks on the tv a sound box or stereo.Only been a few days but if they keep working the way they are right now I'll be very happy.  Update on my review.It's been about a month since receiving these wireless headphones and they really are better than I could of hoped. I like to listen to music with Binaural beats and Isochronic tones on a daily bases and these work just as well as my plug-ins."
RFVR5OH2AOXUX,1,Too much static.
RR7FQPVLEN65S,4,I like this.  It is the third one I have brought over the years.  The range is great.  The only problem is that the new head phone have a lot of static and cut on and off as you move around.  I got my old head phones out and am using them.  They work fine with the new base.
R48V9VH7RE7ZC,4,Very pleased.  Good product. My husband loves it.
R2HNSN47F4W27E,1,I could not get reception within ten feet of the TV.
R30M2W7E3B7XQJ,4,Finally got it to work right...
R2SKKN07WUKN05,1,We have had these headphones for a little over two months and they are already not working. We have done all troubleshooting recommended and still getting only static.<br />I would suggest not wasting your money.
REER080C6TGNY,5,great sound. easy set up. nothing but good things to say about this product.
R3JNRCT927USFX,5,Totally love this product.  Wish I had bought another set earlier than tv ears.  It is of very good quality and I am very happy with this product.
R2V8A0TWB831GF,5,My husband uses these headsets almost everyday
R3EWVVZI4O2DUA,5,This is the second pair of these I bought for my wife to watch tv not because there was a problem with the first pair but because I wanted to make sure she had a backup pair incase the first one wore out or broke. She has used the first pair for years now and loved them because she has to wear hearing aids and can't hear or understand words on tv with the aids but hears clearly with the headphones and being wireless is a bonus and I think better than bluetooth which loses their signal and these Sennheisers have a constant signal. Great &#34;Happy Wife Happy Life&#34;
R2Y9YWGVYH3ZMZ,5,"This is the second one we've bought.  It works well and is great for both someone with a hearing problem, or someone who just wants to listen with the headset - it's better than listening to the TV sound."
R38GDVY61ENAO4,5,"I give this 5 stars because of the good sound but it took a long time to get it set up right.  we have a digital tv.  we found that if you connect to the tv on the earphone out with one plug (an adapter came with the earphones) the tv speaker sound may be turned off.  (says there may be a setting on the tv menu but I didn't find one on ours.)  and you might have to turn the tv volume on to stop the buzz even though you won't hear it.  if you connect to two audio out rca inputs it might work so that you can have both the speakers and the tv, or can mute the tv.  I say might as our tv had only one audio out so I could hear through only one earphone speaker.  the solution was to hook to the two rca audio outs on the cable box.  now all works, earphone sound is good and we can have it with or without the tv sound."
R2QLAF0MXD1UHQ,5,These are awesome!
R1JSX6BUEEIYG8,5,Works great with two set of headphones. If you have two transmitters it will pick up from each other
R8A8NMWABCZFA,3,"I cannot recommend these because of the interference, strange noises, and automatic volume adjustment.<br /><br />I did a lot of research into wireless headphones before buying these.  There are not very many options, so these might be the best at this price, but they still aren't very good.  I have been using these daily for four months, and I can't recommend them.<br /><br />I really like the battery life (I use them for 3-4 hours a day and charge them every 2 or 3 days, and they haven't died on me), and the batteries are replaceable/rechargeable AAA batteries, but the poor sound quality ruins the product for me.<br /><br />I would recommend choosing a wired solution, looking at a higher-end set, and/or waiting for a better set of wireless headphones.<br /><br />Also, they aren't very comfortable after 30 min or so.  They press down on my ears and make them hurt."
R28DKDP2053D8D,2,"I bought these to replace an older similar model I love that fits over my ears. The base stations seem to be interchangeable but I'm very disappointed with the new headset. It sits on top of my ears, is very uncomfortable,  falls off my head if I lean over, has shorter reception range, and the sound quality is also short of that of my older set. My wife and I also have older top of the line Sennheiser noise cancelling ear buds that we really like. This latest purchase has wondering if Sennheiser is now trying to market their products on their reputation rather than the quality of their current products.  I hope I'm wrong because I've relied on and recommended their products to others for many years."
RNN2EBYDYT2BV,3,good
R3G5IP6TPZECC8,4,Product as discribed.
R1K0E0453S0Z8P,5,I had to get another set as I broke the head piece of my first. Got this before they become outdated. The range is great as advertised. Some newer ones just don't transmit as boasted. I'm alright....D Prop
R37KX0VNFP9LRJ,5,Works as advertised! I can now hear much better stereo separation than with my TV speakers. And my TV watching doesn't bother my wife's studying.
R4IW717WXJ1YJ,1,Had a bad experience with this unit.  Worked for a couple of months. (not that great)  Finally quit working..  Would not recommend
RB2RXT0K9YN22,5,"very good quality and easy to wear, comfortably!"
RJQ8EGCB9JJDP,4,"Great range-- I wore them all weekend while cleaning and soldering. Can be subject to some interference if you're using an older cell phone, but it has to be practically in your face. Without any static you can go quite far-- this includes walls and multiple floors. My initial test was to place the unit near my window, and I was able to walk all the way to the complex across the road before getting any interference. I don't know if it's &#34;300 feet&#34; or w/e by the foot, but even if you own a large house, you shouldn't have any problems. If you do, maybe consider a more expensive set. :P<br /><br />I happen to like that it uses a jack instead of bluetooth. Bluetooth is cool, and likely more appropriate for working out with wireless headphones, but a lot of the stuff I own in my office space does not have bluetooth, or I don't want the added hassle of configuring it.<br /><br />The biggest problem here (for me), is that I like to play music loudly, which is not compatible if anyone else is around. The sound quality is great, and it doesn't feel like you're 'projecting', but there's no way you could listen to these about 25% volume with anyone else around. I'm considering returning and getting some others that cover the ear more."
RW71XPBS3GGTX,5,works great!
R11LKPQHLL5JHV,5,"LOVE THESE. Very clear reception. I can wear them anywhere in Apartment and not disturb my housemate. Comfortable, but a little big for my head...be careful if you bend over, they have a tendancy to fall off me."
R1Z3T2X9WVGXZT,4,I've been very happy with these over the first two months of ownership. I use them for watching TV at night so the wife can sleep. The battery life is great and easily allows several hours of listening for each of two nights without charging. They are very comfortable during that time. The charger engages by only laying the headset on the charger. Volume is good and adjustable. Tone and frequency balance is fine for TV listening. The tuning knob allows me to completely eliminate any static.
RKKXZGFPEJ8CC,5,I have had TV ears headphones for years. Gone through 4 sets. The last set was their new and improved version and they were junk. Checked on Amazon looking for a replacement and found the Sennheiser RS120.  This is 1000 percent better they any TV Ears. The sound and quality is fantastic. The head phones and fully adjustable and comfortable on the ears. If your looking for quality these are the ones.
R16Z6D9X1BGZLW,5,"I gave this as a present and they bought a second pair, they loved it so much. Excellent quality."
R2E4WJQAKVVJOI,4,My husband uses them every day for any T V  that he watches - always PBS and sporting events.  For anyone with hearing difficulties I would recommend them without reservation.
R266A9CM179LQB,4,"Great product for TV watching in apartment where sound easily travels. Now that I have set this Sennheiser wireless headphone up in my room, I can listen to television at a level comfortable for me and reduces the battle of sound levels with neighboring apartment tenets. The are reasonably comfortable and the set up was easy. I am a senior citizen and this products helps me understand the dialogue better even at lower levels. I am happy  with this purchase."
R39X73CLSW526B,5,"These have better range than my last pair of wireless phones (Sony), which had static just 10 feet from base with no obstructions at all. Walked into every room and had static-free clear reception. The base has a 3 channel frequency selector, and can be mounted on the wall if you wish. Very happy with this product!"
R22GP9CROZQD01,5,"Great headphones - easy to attach to TV, work well even outside.  Great product with great features such as comfortable, charger in unit always on, small footprint."
R1CE6DEH7B628W,5,Items as described.  Works great.
R2FTHMK42X5AJ1,2,it works good with good range but the stupid things slide of your head if you even look down or walk with them and turn you head even a little they slide right off your head  what good is a headphone if you have to hold it to listen...the last pair i had real cheap ones i could do jumping jacks with them on and they wouldnt move at all
R3RZ7IB0SZ2WXW,5,My husband  love them. I do to!!<br />Now I can sleep in our room!!
R2QQE15G1OTVO3,2,"The sound is fine but the failure is the sound it makes soon after the mute or pause button is pushed. It is really,really annoying. I will pause to answer the phone, get a drink or the like with the headset around my neck and within a minute or two lowd lowd static comes from the set.  I also don't like the channel future I have had ones in the past where that was not necessary. Frequently when I put the headsets on I knock the adjustment instead of the volume as they are   Adjacent  to each other then I have to find the channel of over again.  The headset also does not adjust well so that when I lean over it falls off all of the time.   I'm not quite sure why this received such a vast amount of high stars it seems that there are several failures that would make it less popular. .  Would not recommend"
R1GA3A391RAY1U,4,"we have been using the product for the last one month and is working fine and the sound is very clear.  The only reason, I gave a four star is I wish the 'on-off' switch could be a little more sturdy.  I don't think it can be a problem, but not sure in the long run."
RNU9WU8D4T5X1,3,"I'm trying to love these headphones, I really am. They're comfortable, they're wireless (no more snagging a cord on my desk chair's arm when standing up), and they have pretty decent sound quality, but...<br /><br />* Volume vs Sound Quality: With these headphones, you basically have 2 choices when it comes to volume: you can either listen with limited volume and very low static, or you can listen at higher volume, but with very noticeable hiss when listening to quiet . If you listen to something at a high enough volume, the hiss is drowned out.<br /><br />There is one thing that is making me seriously consider returning them: At random times, for no discernible reason, a HUGE blast of static is emitted from the earmuffs. This extremely loud blast hurts my ears, it's very unnerving, and it scares my cats. I can't find one of them. Seriously, knowing that I will be sonically assaulted by a massive blast of static and hiss at an unknown future time is like having a revolver with one chamber loaded pointed at my head. If I had known about these static storms, I would not have purchased these headphones.<br /><br />I bought these headphones because of Sennheiser's reputation for high quality audio products. These headphones were reasonably priced, but the blast of noise is making me very jumpy. If someone knows how to stop this from happening, please tell me."
R17GFKVI83X0PO,1,Didn't do what I expected.
R2ASUN45HXLFII,2,"I can't review the sound quality because I returned them after trying them on and walking around in them for a brief period.  These headphones are very flimsy feeling, and provide very little pressure onto your head.  I do not have a large head, but have never been told that I have a puny head either.  Wearing these (sizes as small as possible) these headphones would begin to shift when I tilted my head forward or turned my head to talk to someone.  I have Sennheiser HD555s which feel great and are a similar size, so I assume this just might be a problem with there RF headphone line.  I could not see these headphones falling off or becoming uncomfortably loose unless I sat completely still while using them."
RZN9MHX4O1QH9,4,Good product
RCJL86LMWTS5V,4,"These headphones work very well for me. I have severe hearing loss and to hear the TV I have to turn it up to where everyone else is being blasted into their own form of deafness. I watch TV with the CC on all the time because I cannot understand what is being said but the CC is far from perfect, in fact on most devices it is very poor and you can't get a good read on what the actors are talking about. So I got an idea and thought, with all the technology we have today, there has got to be a set of bluetooth headphones out there that don't require wires strung across the room. So my search turned these up. I ordered. My Stereo sound system was already connected to the TV Audio Out. So I could have the TV audio controlled separately on the Sound System from the TV. This gave the ability for me to plug the HDR120 phones into the sound system, thereby giving me separate control of the volume to the headphones and my wife control of the volume to the normal TV. Now I can hear every freaking word that is spoken on the TV shows without blowing my wife out of the room. She can control the TV volume for the room and she's happy, I'm happy and I bet the neighbors are happy too. Now about the headphones themselves. They work very well. I don't notice any hissing except on some mp4's and other Movie files but that is the problem of the file quality. Normal TV doesn't have noise, but keep in mind, I have severe hearing loss and noise is in the higher frequencies and I may not be able to hear the noise anyway. This review is more for the hard of hearing. I can go anywhere in the house (two story) and never lose the sound or quality, which is nice because I don't have to pause the program I am watching or the song I am listening to. Music with these phones is fantastic. The only problem I have with these phones is the earpieces are flat, not cupping your ears, so if you are doing something that requires you to bend over, they are not tight enough to hold on and will slip off yourhead. Cupped earpieces would stop this. All in all, for the hearing impaired they are fantastic for watching TV and listening to music. It was the best idea I ever had for watching TV."
R2MKIWGPO9CXTW,4,"3 rd pair, great"
RB7R38N64LQXR,5,very happy with these wireless headsets
R2U21Z7KR8XJSY,5,So far I really like the headphones.
R8ZJEP58ZER55,4,Absolutely love these! I have two kids and live in a townhouse almost impossible to hear the TV really well with a 3yr old and 11 yr old both running a tablet and phone unless I really turn the TV volume up and I don't wanna make it so loud that I disturb the neighbors. this works perfectly is comfortable the signal is great and it lasts really long I've used them all day long without the batteries needing to be recharged. I gave it 4 stars just because I wish it was a little more snug to where it didn't fall of my head if I look down
R188OWZZQXY291,3,"They are good, just they are not the best in fitting to ears also the voice can leak out when you increase the volume (not very good isolation)"
R2NPH6HL3LN2ME,5,These are awesom headphones. I use them a lot and very satisfied
RZALZDM6BNRG,5,"Excelent, good sound quality.I recommended"
R1Z43Q1RKK9SGW,5,My dad likes to wake up early and watch TV....this was the perfect solution.
R2UCWNBLZ4ESAU,5,"I have had these for several years now, only replaced rechargeable batteries, works great. Will buy again, or a newer model."
R3PA3634T60HE8,3,Need fine tweaking of the tuning and volume control in order to get static free and clear reception.
R188RQM0KJ35Z4,1,"We had these for two weeks and my husband loved them, but while he was sitting watching television he dropped them and<br />they quit working.  I ordered him new ones and I thought I could return the others.  Now I missed the return date by 3 days and can't<br />return them.  I will try to get a refund from my American Express.  Not a good return policy.  If they break when dropped from a sitting<br />position, they are not very good.  I am not going to spend all day trying to find the manufacturer's return policy.<br /><br />I would suggest a better return policy on something electronic."
R1D3GA50PPO9H2,4,"I use the headphones in the bedroom to eliminate the request to turn down the volume. They work very well, but are loose on the head and can fall off your head easily. I first plugged the unit into the cable box but the headphones were out of sequence with with the TV. I then plugged it into the audio out of the TV, that worked great. The headphones are worth the price, just be careful when moving around."
R1HHG39IIHS86G,5,This was a gift for my hubby but I ended up reaping the benefits. Now I can sleep in peace while he can stay up late and watch his movies!
R26MQEFO838Q8K,1,"Worked twice.  Purchased these for my mom who is now in a nursing home.  They wouldn't work for my mom.  My brother took them home and tested on two TVs.  Only worked on one.  He brought them back to the nursing home and someone there got them to work but only for a day.  Playing around trying to get them to work we went over the 30 day, no exception, return deadline.  We are now out the cost of the headphones and stuck with something that doesn't work.  Very disappointed in Sennheiser and in Amazon."
R3S2YP3LGZ9Q6Q,3,I have a small head and have trouble keeping it on my head.  Have to sit very still or it falls off.
R23Z0H4NYELQOX,5,It works well and helps my hearing a lot. The first one had a faulty charging stand so we returned it.
R1UXW0PZR5JVAP,5,I've had this headset or over year now and it is outstanding.
R1YMTKNTUYLCJZ,5,"My RS 120s are my third set of headphones.  My first set was a Sennheiser battery-powered model and I was totally happy with same; the eart foam pads eventually wore out.  My replacement headphones were a cheaper wireless rechargeable set and I was not as pleased as I was with my first set for two reasons, 1) The range of the wireless was only 25 feet with no obstructions and, 2)  The earpads were heavy and very hot, made my ears sweat (ugh).  My new RS 120s have great range (even when I go outside to my grill, to the restroom, etc) and are very comfortable."
R3V1LRXKH7D5AH,3,"Very convenient if I want to walk around and still hear the tv or my laptop. However, it is very staticy."
R1S3HFGSTFBZG7,5,really like this!
R1OHBDLGKLLJ8I,3,Great product.A liitle too pricey though.
R3A7XI9V1ULIYR,4,"If you want great stereo sound without bothering your neighbor with your 5.1 stereo, these will do.  They don't fit the head without some discomfort after a couple of hours of listening, but what headphones do?  Easy tuning and loudness controls.  They work in an 1100sq ft. condo;  start to lose some signal strength after 50 ft. and 3 walls.  Still great for any TV or stereo sound  needs if you can't conventionally listen to something at 3am!<br />I'd buy them again."
R2D6KEYIKAU8T9,5,What a device.  My wife can watch her t.v. without elevating the volume to out blast mine
RZA8M89KFWAFF,5,Seems to be a great produce.  Meets my needs well.
R28BOO0A0M3FK5,4,"I wish the dial placement was a bit different/more defined. Volume and frequency tuning both on the right ear, so I've changed the tuning when wanting to change the volume. The ear muffs are comfortable, and the band is not too tight. It fits over my big head easily. I charged once, have used for 8 hours, maybe, and haven't put on the charger, yet. I left for vacation for over a week, so didn't use for 2 weeks and when I got back, after leaving on my side table, I still have used it for a few hours. I guess I'm silly waiting until it dies, but I want to see how long it can go on a charge.<br /><br />The sound is good, pretty spacious. Maybe too spacious at times, but that is also a product of the output of the source (I also use with my satellite receiver and Bluray player). The satellite goes staticy at times, which could be the optical to analog tool I'm using, but going into the settings is quick and easy, and resets the sound. If you have the option to use straight to analog you should be good.<br /><br />Lastly, you get what you pay for, and having to tune the headphones to the transmitter was weird in this day and age, but for the price, it is a small price to pay, and once tuned it stays locked really well and for a long distance from the transmitter. Just have the previously mentioned &#34;issue&#34; of accidentally changing the tuning when going for the volume button."
R2VJ71S94T388D,4,Sound ok. A bit tight on ears after a while
R3SBGR6FWL5MIW,5,Awesome
R3OV3ENHFRBC66,3,"I should have bought the RS160's  called Sennheiser  who could not address my needs also they tend to fall off way to easily , which could eventually lead to breakage  as far as quality goes poor much interference / static  expected more  from them considering the price tag"
R1OI4YUJVYPWJI,5,i love it
R1S4QAYI1V4SRF,5,"These headphones are the answer to my problem. To cut down on electricity costs during the summer I have some pretty powerful fans going. In order to hear the tv over the fans, the volume needed to be at its max causing disruption to others. Now I can turn the tv volume all the way down and just use the headphones. The headphones were easy to setup for a crisp clear sound. Really glad I purchased and will probably be adding more headsets."
R3LTA5QDSRM8P9,4,works well.  covers on ear phones come off easily but no big deal.
R2SRGCLRT1GPYV,4,"I bought these about six years ago and loved them but have had an ongoing problem--there seems to be a short in the wiring in the right ear, and I had to turn the volume up high in order to get any sound in that ear at all.  Eventually I resorted to sticking a folded piece of paper into the volume knob to angle it to one side, and then I could get sound.  Last night that finally stopped working, so I am now looking for a replacement.<br /><br />I tend to use these at night when the children are in bed and I don't want to wake anyone up, or when hubby is playing on his computer and doesn't want to be disturbed by the t.v. sound.<br /><br />Pros: wonderful sound, much better than t.v. speakers; long range (I could go upstairs into my master bathroom or into the kitchen to wash dishes and still hear the t.v. loud and clear); good reception and no interference in my experience; when the rechargeable batteries wore out (after about five years of use) I was able to replace them with regular rechargeables (AA) and they worked with the Sennheiser charger.<br />Cons: problems with the right ear; they are large and tend to fall off when I move around, especially when trying to lie down on the couch at night; the charger/transmitter really looks nice but does take up space on the t.v. stand<br /><br />Overall, though, I would say that I got many years of use, and in spite of the wonky right ear problem, really loved them.  I may try a different brand this time around, though, in search of more comfort in terms of wear."
R25D4GVPTEV20Q,5,"great product easy to install, however is very touchy with the volume button, the best sound mostly comes from the left side, some constant hissing from the right that wont go away, brifly quits but most of the time present, can go to bathroom porch etc, still comes in.."
R3AMAHKPQRZ04H,5,"I love them, but once in a while it will lose the signal for a second or two. The signal comes back fast by moving my head. It has tuner, but once tuned to the frequency you shouldn't have to touch it.  Update: I found the problem with losing the signal It was the dual analog plug didn't fit good in my TV. I bought an optical cable to go to the TV and now it works great so I upgraded from four to five stars."
R3FJCZA0AQCJK0,1,"Headphones have stopped working already, three months after purchase. No option to return or replace. Don't buy."
R23PY03QWV1K4,4,"UPDATE: Back to 4 stars. My original (below) report is / was correct....however, after using these for a week or so, some issues have come up. [1] NOT comfortable for long term use. The ear pieces are too flat, uncomfortably smashing the ears (particularly when glasses are worn).They should be recessed in the center for better ear clearance. [2] The ear pieces aren't allowed to swivel sufficiently for good fit and comfort. [3] In spite of smashing one's ears, they fall off if one bends over, their hefty weight exacerbating this problem. My el-cheapo wireless headsets are WAAAY more comfortable. Yeah-the ones that DON'T WORK. Sadly thse COULD be a home run if redesigned for more comfort.  I will continue to use them as the range is truly incredible. Of the 4 or 5 wireless headsets this is the only one with the range to which I allude in my initial critique. The only other issue I now have after using them for many hours, is the weak high frequency response. Very good headset that could be better. With their range, I'd say go for them.<br />&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;<br />Fantastic headphones!  Ever since my Advent wireless phones went South, I've been looking for a replacement. After several abvortive attempts with lower priced units, I finally gave in to spend the $USD on these. Range?  Absolutely unbelievable. And I thought my Advents were good. My house is in the center of a 1 acre lot, and these Sennheiser 'phones have no drop-outs ANYWHERE on my property, includiing in the three outbuildings. Needless to say, I can't lose them in the house. I can probably use these rather than my Peltor hearing protection while mowing, and listen to music to boot. Fidelity? Superb! As close to wired headphones as one could get. I hope they continue to work this well as they age. I'm blown away . TV? Wow! Now I can get to the kitchen or other areas and not lose the TV audio."
R2BJGQOX64VCCD,2,"I am surprised for the amount of 5 star reviews these headphones have, they feel like 20th century technology. The sound is not clear at all, u have to keep tuning them with the transmitter and I could never achieve a perfect tune with  neither of the 3 transmitting options on the transmitter. Very disappointing, will be returning them"
RS568WLL2CI4X,4,Would not sync at first but with a little fine-tuning they are really nice.  Excellent battery life. Very comfortable for prolonged periods.
R19HOKT7ZU7AC,5,Great buy
R3IPWCRH49NNZ2,5,Got these for my 80 year old Papa who has no experience with computers and he is easily able to use them.  He wears them to watch TV while my grandmother sleeps and she says she can't hear a thing! Seems to work very well.
R2B453UTUJQDGZ,5,"Works wonderful.!!!!  if you have hearing loss, this is the best thing ever.  I you don't, you can turn the volume down on the TV if you have a hard hearing person in the home.  Win - Win"
R2IWHZQFW1STO8,4,"Excellent product.  The sound is superb.  The only problem is that you have to keep the volume up enough (not loud) on the TV so that it sends the signal to the headphones.  If the volume is too low, there is a 5 minute timer that shuts off the dialog and becomes loud static in your ears.  I had to go the website to find out why it kept dropping the signal.  Now that I know I have no problems."
R2L5DJK4DUCXL1,3,"Great headphones - decent range, charging cradle is great! UPDATE: I now own 3 of these- after about 6 months, 2 of them start losing a channel- it gets all staticy and you have to turn the volume up and down to get some sound on the particular channel. Very disappointed about that!"
R22S90NVPFQKWA,5,Husband very pleased with it.
R3U9IV6PLKHHJ2,5,It worked just like the ad said it would. We are very pleased.
R1RNPL1D4O49EL,5,"works good, comfortable."
R1ZO7QGY54UUEB,4,Worked as expected.
R10PEXV6EVXG7L,5,"I regulary use a pair of these I bought earlier and my wife just started using this pair. We both like them, but my wife hasn't quite gotten the back of tuning them properly. It took me a while too, but the small effort needed is well worth the result. Learning not to set them down on the couch with the tuning wheels down really helps to avoid having to adjust the signal or volume.<br /><br />When watching movies, the sound track will often fluctuate from quiet voices too loud music, explosions, or gun shots during action scenes and the result is sometimes that the sound level is just too loud for home viewing. We live in a condo and need to be sensitive to our neighbors needs for quiet time in the evenings and these help a lot. Some movies on DVD also have poor soundtracks that don't properly adjust for people talking at normal levels with music or other backgroud sounds. These help."
R3TFH4MH3L8FHZ,3,"Following drawbacks are bad for your ears:<br />1). When I switch-off the TV (without switching-off the head phone), it suddenly makes loud noise.<br />2). When I pause the TV, it suddenly hear loud noise."
R1FQYOF13YGHKR,5,Quite simply the best RF headphones I've ever bought.  Outstanding sound quality right out of the box.  No adjustment needed. Doesn't mess up wifi signal of nearby modern/router like some other headphones do.
R2LXO5F75LUU0R,4,Good value.
R1V4K7KUVU0TB6,5,Sounds great.
RXF9SSV2DSJ8I,5,"WORKS GREAT A GREAT DISTANCE, LIKE THIS THING"
R1HKBTD4FJ02I5,5,This is my 3rd headset.  Really enjoy being able to hear what I am looking at and would highly recommend these to anyone who might have a bit of a hearing problem.
RIO1TODVIAECR,2,"I had to tape the &#34;tune&#34; control in place. The sound kept changing for no apparent reason. On the other hand, the sound is good."
R2259AV6PMERL,1,"Although I purchased them a year ago, I just opened the box to use them, plugged in the power adapter and the transmitter power indicator does not light up. Junk right out of the box. I am an electrical engineer and the power adapter is providing the correct voltage."
R35N37K687RNAZ,5,Great sound
RV66B6G4WS5KG,4,"Just what I was looking for. However, they don't fit well on my head. If I look down and bow my head or reach over to pick something up they fall right off.. The  earpieces are adjustable but  not enough. Still, they work good !"
R39SODCD1Q1316,5,Got these for my hubby and he loves them--and so do I :))  Would recommend to anyone who needs help hearing the TV.
R1NFD1O71R4D3N,5,love it
R3VRKPAZI72J31,5,Very good product over the past 2 year with Google RF range.
R3HHA0L9JAOKVN,5,"I was at first reluctant to order these, as they were way less expensive than a set we are using in another room.  However, they were very easy to install, they work like a dream, are quite comfortable, and I love them.  I use them five days a week while I walk on a treadmill for a couple of hours.  The sound is perfect, which is important since I am listening to Spanish soap operas in an attempt to improve my Spanish.  I would definitely recommend them.  By the way, the Sennheiser technical support is superb."
RC6Q01TXALYH8,4,Love the sound.  Like not having to use batteries.  Easily hooked it up to my Samsung Smart TV.  But had to move the base around till I found a good location that did not cause interference in the transmission.  Very comfortable headset.
R19OXHMTY5YX36,3,Does not block outside noise.
R25LQM0NLMCLIS,5,Could not get it to work with a Digital to Analog Audio Converter that I had also purchased. After spacing the TV out from the wall more than it was I was able to reach the audio out port and used the rca adapter to connect. This worked perfectly. My wife needs the headphones to have a higher volume than I need over the tv speakers. Also we can mute the tv speakers and listen with the headphones while the other one reads. We can walk all around the house and out to the deck and still have very good reception. They are not as comfortable as my Boise headset but for the price they do a very good job.
RS6IW55TCSSBI,5,Did every thing they said they would do.  would say to any one wanting this type of headphones to buy tham
R1MUJMHRT2N0B1,5,"These work very well and are very comfortable.  One particular thing that I appreciate is the option to change transmitting frequencies if there is any interference and a fine tuning adjustment that  allows you to tune it precisely.  I have not seen this on any other wireless earphones.  Additionally, the hiss that you normally get with wireless earphones is minimal if you use the fine tune knob."
RREF11P658P7N,4,"It was a LITTLE tricky getting it set up, and it has a few quirks (like you have to wait for a few seconds before it comes on or goes off ... and if you pause the TV for too long, it goes to static).  But, if you can get past that stuff (watch videos on YouTube to figure it out), it works GREAT!  It has VERY clear sound (better than the external speaker on my TV), and it has a great range."
R45UDKQNME7MX,3,Better off your ears as a speaker mine cuts in and out and crackles. Not very good.  Very disappointed as senheiser is a great brand.  Would recommend you buy Bluetooth and never touch these.
R3OCKK14O0CJUK,5,Great price and best quality item
R2UAAIXYHSH9SM,5,"What a fantastic invention.  I am retired but my wife still works, therefore, she has to go to sleep at an earlier hour than myself.  I just put on my wireless headphones that I call my &#34;ears' and watch whatever I want without disturbing my sleeping wife."
R1P1Q476EKQNZG,5,This is the second set of Sennheiser RS120 on-Ear Wireless RF Headphones that we have purchased.  Excellent quality and shipping was very efficient.  Would recommend the purchase to anyone who needs something that helps the hearing impaired.
R1GH6L8UZ0RSNJ,5,sennheiser has always meant quality to me...and these 'phones don't disappoint! purchased for my hard-of-hearing father to allow him to hear his tv shows without blasting out everyone else in the house. was so impressed i bought a pair for myself! would recommend!
R2ZLJFRLVT796Q,4,Very happy with this headphone.
R3T98ZDE6TTDO8,4,"very good, fast shipping"
R10VUZT0RT5JQ8,1,"This item was defective.  I was in Florida when it arrived and didn't check it out until it was past the return date.  I would like a replacement, as it never worked.  How can I get satisfaction?"
R23DWKTD3Y79K8,3,"1. The tuning function needs to be improved.  2. Can the TV sound (on/off) be controlled by the on/off switch of the Sennheiser RS120 headphone side, rather than the plug in or out on the side of the TV monitor?"
R3SZBPUBZ4663F,5,My wife loves them!
R3P0FP9C1CG813,5,GREAT BUY!
R2W95AMGVL3QBY,2,These just died for no reason after 1-2 years of not heavy use. The charging base isn't great. You have to get headphones on charger perfectly to stay. The volume jump is high.  I have had better in the past. I will be replacing with a different brand.
R1ISZ6LBBD2IA0,1,"The product is a good idea at affordable price. Unfortunately, it doesn't necessarily work every time. In the past, I had the same product , but I was naive to think that I must be doing something wrong and didn't pay much attention. Now, I decided to buy one for my father but the same issues we experienced again and unfortunately I had to return it and got back my money!"
R1YK29IJN7T2M0,3,They have made these a little cheaper then they used to but the overall functionality of them is pretty good.
R1LIB0BF6HS1SO,5,Handy for device!
R1V43X7QHECX2P,5,"Durable, easy to,use great show under federal r the p I cr"
R34JEGWTU95MEE,5,"bought these for my 85 year old grandad, He loves them, LOVES them......"
R1PEHEAEM1NRYS,5,I really like these headphones. I use them everyday and they are crystal clear. I never have any problems with them. They are very dependable and easy to charge.
R3728TIFRKXRQI,5,"Have had these for several months. No problems. Great sound quality. Can go into other room and still hear tv just fine. I would minus half a star just for the slight discomfort I get on my ears, but that is due to glasses. Oh for a more cushiony ear pad for eyeglass-wearers!! I do solve this by sticking a small cotton pad between my ear and glasses' earpiece. Too bad I have to do that, but I'll live."
R1BDZN6KNBG2HA,2,"Good enougj sound quality when operatinh, but strong, anmying static during PAUSE. what's worse, they have to be tuned, and the signal rises and faded when you walk out of the room.<br /><br />Further, they do not hold you head securely (will fall off if you lean forward/backward)!<br /><br />In summary: more pain in the ass than they're worth."
R18LKZ4IJGI4OU,5,Was just as described easy setup and good sound
R3HMWW4T4ZP1IT,5,Great phones i can walk all over the house and not miss any audio from tv.
R12P818U5S0E6R,5,I have enjoyed the great sound of wireless headphones from Sennheiser.<br />Last night after listening I hung up my phones and the red light or blue light would not come on. I only get static<br />I AM ORDERING a new set of Sennheiser on ear wireless RF Head phones and returning the other set
R17QORV54HJ4SY,1,"The fit was very uncomfortable. If I put my head down or back, the headphones slipped off. I returned them."
R5UD7MQMM9CGO,5,These work great.  Battery lasts a long time too. Highly recommend.
RF63F49JTPG0,5,"Good quality, comfortable, I like it.  I use it at close range but I'll go to get a &#34;notha&#34; beer and leave the show playing, and it works great all the way to the kitchen.  I like em.  I don't use them a lot, but when I have they have been great.  easy to install and tune.  I saw someone else talking about static, None, I don't think they dialed it in well enough.  It's like dialing in a radio in the 80's.  And Mine has never drifted, only need to touch it when I hit it on accident."
R11LTW0ILO65MC,5,LUV IT.
R3NE33DAD0BY53,5,Works great
R3NDBIRSVAFYC7,5,They work well.
R8A4CWBVZ8N0Z,5,Everything about these headphones is great. They have better sound quality than my prior headphones. The range is quite far. I can walk room to room and even go outside and listen.
R352KN38Z5SRI4,4,slips off my head  not as good as a Sony
R3V18ZT195VB6J,4,Works well
R3HL292JE1B0VG,5,they work great.A+++++++
RJ143EGS3960J,1,"I wasn't able to get the audio to connect reliably no matter how I fiddled the tuning. It was a present for my dad, but he never used it.  I think you may need a digital one to get a decent result with this kind of product."
R3D3X6ZK201QXY,5,Purchased two of these. We use both headphones using one of the RF transmitters connected to our TV set and use the other base for charging the second set of headphones. Works great and the headphones are copnfortable to wear. We are very pleased with this purchase.
R2WIMCR1H92FJ8,5,works great
R3LUNBTXFB26QN,5,great sound
R2CX9TK7MH3EKU,4,"Overall works pretty well, but is a bit tricky to tune in the sound and tune out the noise."
RZMG44X3WXOAH,5,"Works great, clear and good volume."
RWXDQU3N9JICT,5,"I ordered these because I have a hearing problem and wind up missing a lot of the dialogue during TV shows, even with the volume turned up. These have solved the problem for me. I can hear everything clearly even over the background music, and the sound quality is excellent. I would recommend them to anyone with a similar problem. I love them"
R35H7GQYJJZTVV,5,"Pretty good, my ears get tired if I wear too long but I am happy with them."
R18HX39E2VF4RH,4,"Easy set up, no connection or lag issues. Could use a bit more bass but solid for the price when Bluetooth isn't available."
R2LLO00A9T52TR,4,ok
R2PWO5WNPPPX8L,5,These headphones are awesome  !!!  I work in a noisy machine shop with a lot of electrical interference . They work almost flawless.  The building is 200 ft long and I can get reception from one end to the other.  No problem with battery life either. The sound is fantastic  !!  I would highly recommend these  .
R5EF5RG0P9LPL,5,Very pleased with these head phones light weight the sound is awesome and extremely comfortable sometimes I even forget I have them on. Excellent product!!!
R2VCIU6SV3EVC6,1,terrible quality
R3POF1U8SGLI8P,3,"I've had three different headsets like this, and this one is mediocre in comparison, and not as good as other reviews claimed.<br /><br />Trivial: On/off should be triggered by stretching the headset over your head, and not a switch.<br /><br />Range is much less than claimed: maybe 50'.<br /><br />The tuning required to get the signal from the base unit (first unit I've had that required this) is annoying.<br /><br />Worst: while listening, what you're listening to drops-out and is replaced by radio static (at a higher volume) exploding in your ears.  This is output device independent, so a function of the headphones (base unit) themselves.  This will happen while standing still, so not a function of going out of range (which will also cause this).  Extremely irritating."
R1TMN8XG4VGTM4,4,Work as predicted.
R29QYQCLHZF9TS,5,these work great -- those that go to bed early don't get bothered!!
R35WZRCTMJGA76,5,"No longer need to use captions when watching TV with my hearing-impaired husband!  He can have volume where he needs it, with no outside noise to interfere."
R2KCW7RCT0IJ1O,5,Headphones work great - very good sound and convenient to use. Especially I love the way charging works - don't have to plug in anything - just hang them back on the rack and forget about it.
R3BNH7EATT1XU5,5,Got these for my hubby and he loves it! I love it because he can watch TV without waking up the babies.
R8ZOXM8KCVRE7,5,love it
R1TD3PSB9BTUGH,5,"These are great. My younger son and I love to watch movies and with wooden floors in the house and a Bose sound system, it gets loud. The other members of our family appreciate the occasional quiet moments when we use the headphones. Also useful if you want to watch tv while someone sleeps. Sound quality is really good- certainly better than just listening to the external speakers on the tv. You pick up some of the quieter noises from the movie/show on the headphones  that you miss even from a really nice sound system- feet crunching on gravel- that kind of thing. Blocks external noise somewhat so things are clearer."
RUCKSS9AJLFCK,5,"I've used these headphones for my TV for months and they're even better than what I anticipated.  Easy to set up and operate.  When others are in my home visiting and they want to sleep while I'm still awake, I just use my headphones.  I hear my programs, they don't.  During commercials, I take the phones off.  If I need to go to the kitchen, or even outside for something, I can still listen to what's going on with the program.  To watch TV without earphones, just remove the connector from the TV and voila! you have regular sound again."
RB8OLSRNL4EET,3,Sound quality is good but cuts in and out in long distance and short distance. Hard to tune to keep sound quality. Will be returning them and buying a wired pair.
R3DA4WC4RU64ZR,2,I had high hopes for these based on the reviews but when I put them on they felt heavy and I couldn't adjust the ear pieces to lie flat against me ears.  They just didn't feel right on my head. Maybe it's my head that's not right!  Since I didn't feel like sitting around with vise grips on my head I returned them straight away.
R3QR24MQ87DU2A,5,"Ok to put it plain and simple, these headphones are absolutely amazing! I bought 2 sets so my wife & I can watch TV in the living room & the bedroom without waking up our daughter at night. We'll start a program in the living room, and when its time to retire to the bedroom, shut off that TV and move into the bedroom and pick it right back up on the same RF channel without retuning the headphone signal. Simply amazing, and the sound is full & satisfying. I highly recommend these, the price is surprisingly cheap for the fullness of sound, and the quality of construction. Sennheiser is a quality product we've both known and trusted for years, and they did not disappoint!<br /><br />Great job Sennheiser!"
R10FJH7TPPIGS8,5,great sound and comfort.
R300VHVX7MAJ8U,5,"Great headphones, this is the second set we've purchased for the second TV :)"
R2JBVL4GFBA0E7,5,All I have to say is AWESOME. Easy setup and works perfectly.
R2XQKLG0X11AWJ,3,Works great but not particularly comfortable over the ears
R2ON7HN5NPPVJB,4,It arrived on time as promised and as shown.  I had to send them back for repair which was done at no charge.
R31PS2N3BWRMP0,5,Saved me from a few fights over TV noise.  Everyone uses this at night to watch TV at higher volume but without affecting others in the house.  Easy to set up.  I may buy another pair of headphones.  Not perfect fit but sound is great.  Affordable and effective.
RS07WR9C2WNNF,1,worked excellent during a few months. After 2-3 months totally stopped working
RTOUGXHEZ23KS,5,These headphones have worked wonderfully.
R3PFO1GLTTQMXW,3,Bought a pair of these almost a year ago. Great service however;<br />Not near the quality reflected by the price.<br />Noisy 20 feet from the base unit.<br />Adjustment extremely sensitive. Very hard to adjust.<br />Replaced the batteries the first month so I don't have to recharge every few hours.
R1BBBVUUXA27PR,5,My husband loves them
R2J4KB7S166W73,4,"Excellent quality sound, clear with no distortion. Fits nicely over the ear and comfortable"
R389ID0JS94ORQ,1,A lot of noise impairing the ability to listen to the TV sound. After a week it simply broke. Product returned. Will never buy it again.
R2CVRAIMVGIKKU,5,"Wonderful headphones, easy to install, comfortable. They have great sound!"
R3TDY2FRL9OJZY,3,"Pros:  easy set up, easy to adjust volume and tuning,  long range,  wireless.  Cons: clunky design, unnecessarily heavy to wear, slips off head easily"
R1XD4VRGJNHFO1,5,satisfied
R382883C5NNCJV,2,"They worked great and the sound quality was incredible in my opinion. After a few months they started to not work occasionally, almost like they were warming up. The sound would cut out a few times, then work perfectly. This progressively got worse, and not they aren't working at all. I'm trying to see if there is a return or repair option, otherwise I'm just going to open it up and try to fix whatever is wrong on my on I guess."
R1WQMO50Y79SKJ,2,I got two and ½ years out of these phones.<br /><br /> Bought a set in 2012 for $67. What has failed has been the speaker wire coming from the charger has a short in it. Unfortunately—it is built into the charger and I cannot replace it.<br /><br />You be the judge.
R2JGAAP0GCZUKN,3,"Sound is pretty good.  Charging base is nice.  The RCA jack is hard-wired into the base, which prevents you from changing it out should there be a problem in the future.  The other thing I don't completely like is that there is a channel selector on the base for the signal and a dial on the headphones to tune it.  Why is one a switch and the other a dial?  Makes no sense.  Also the tuner dial is right next to the volume.  You hit the wrong one and you get blasted with white noise.  Not the most brilliant design."
R2P1PY4I1EYC76,5,"Ok..I have to put my two cents in about these headphones.  First of all, I made the mistake of overthinking the installation.  This was so easy it's almost embarrassing how much thought I had put into it. Sheesh!  Anyway, setup was easy-peasy, sound is great and the headphones are very comfortable. I got these for my husband who is hard of hearing (he wears hearing aids) and has trouble hearing the talk over the music in movies. These work wonderful for him and he is one happy camper now.  I set the headphones up to be used with or without the TV volume. The plugs on the stand/charger were black and red (not red and white as they should have been) and these should be plugged into the AUDIO OUT on your TV, or if not available on your TV, plug them into the back of your cable box (in my case, red into red AUDIO OUT, black into white AUDIO OUT). There is a VOLUME and TONE control on one side of the headphones and ON/OFF switch on the other.  This was a very good investment."
R1RBJNWZAUUSH3,5,We have two of these. One in our bedroom and one in the living room. They work great! We can watch movies late without waking up the kids and my son can play Xbox without us having to hear it. I think the sound quality is fantastic but I'm not an audiophile. The only downside with our setup is that the two interfere with each other if they are both being used.
R2BWF2UK8HS28G,1,Didn't work had a factory defect and I had to returned
R1RD3AVEX7A9JR,3,Ear phones don't cup over the ears! a lot of sound is lost with the flat design.  Wish I would of know this fact.D
R12HEZOJLW7620,3,"Nice sound, but guaranteed to fall off if you bend over, as in getting out of a chair.  So, hold on to them."
R3QRISKMTL7ZZZ,5,"I bought these for my uncle and he loved them, we tried them and they were loud enough and had a such a good signal that we could play music from 3 rooms over without a problem."
R2E39LGP46SOY8,3,"I don't like the static it gives if there is no sound for a continuous 3 minutes... The headset fits ok. I wish, if i could make it little tighter"
R9NJ2WZ9DHMY,5,Much better than the sony wireless. These work well for the price.
R18MLU0VROFL9U,5,works great!!! loving it
R3417T9NOGX8DR,1,It worked for about a week after the warranty ended. A waste of money.
R2VOTFRC3R4ELT,4,"These earphones are so good. I don't have to blast the TV so loud anymore in order to understand what is said on TV. They make you feel as if you are in surround sound; you can hear lots of sounds that you normally wouldn't hear with just the TV speakers. After giving these as a gift,which my niece's husband loves & keeps the peace ,I had to purchase a set for my self."
R2TR6MSLQ6PDRA,5,"You won't mistake these for audiophile headphones, but they just may have saved my marriage. My wife has bouts of insomnia and will watch TV in the middle of the night. I can't sleep when the TV is on. We tried a pair of TV Ears, and they felt very uncomfortable. Additionally the TV ears operate by an IR beam which is line of sight. If you turn away from the TV the beam is broken and the sound cuts out. The Sennheisers operate on RF and you can still hear even if you go to another room. The range seems to be about 30-40 feet. The rechargeable batteries provide about 8 hours of operation. To charge simply place the headphones on the cradle, but you have to make sure they are facing the right direction and making contact (the charging light will go on). We bought extra rechargeable batteries (It uses AAA size) and a charger so we always have a set ready to go, even if we forget to place the headphones on the cradle. The sound quality is very good, but not audiophile quality. It's perfectly adequate for watching TV and occasional music, but if you're serious about music you may be disappointed with these."
R132V55XXKBOK2,5,They work very well.  These replace a pair of Sony wireless head phones that quit working.  They sent a replacement that lacked a transmittter and looked cheaper than the ones I originally bought. So they agreed to refund my money.  And these Sennheiserare headphones are working great.working great.
R4BZSOBI1SNWW,5,these are great! lets me watch tv while my wife goes to sleep. my hearing sucks to begin with but with these I hear all the words and no one else is bothered.
R1T0MMMV1IRKOG,5,"I did not know if this product was going to work for me, but I am glad I took a chance. My family hates it when I watch TV late into the night, but with this product, I do not have to worry anymore. It was easy to setup and very comfortable. Need to order another one for a friend."
R2M2UM5UY3VGC4,3,They have good sound quality and range.  You still get radio static.  The only reason I got these instead of digital is so my dad can use them to hear the TV without everyone else getting blown out of the room.  The digital ones have a slight delay causing an echo effect.  So he'll just have to live with the static in these analog ones.
RC9AR4G2NP2LQ,2,so much ststic you can not use them
RQ2MNWVCGIN8,5,This is a very good product. I have used them for about a year. Just what I wanted.
R3G0UWOE4UN3V9,5,"These sound great for older user's hearing as someone else had posted but I've not compared the audio to any other headphone but Sony MDR-RF970R. To be fair to the Sony, I used them back when the frequency spectrum had 900MHz overcrowded. Now that spectrum is ideal for wireless headphones; range and interference ate not a problem for 90% of house and yard in my suburban area that has 2.4GHz spectrum overcrowded, killing my Wi-Fi at that frequency (I use 5GHz 802.11AC with little interference and food coverage for Wi-Fi. I didn't like the fit of either headset until I took the ear pads off the Sony and placed them on the Sennheiser headset. Now they sound and feel much better and don't fall off when I lean forward. I had to order replacement ear pads because the old Sony ones were cracked and peeling, leaving black vinyl dots stuck to me ear. The lead times are long, coming from China but the photo shows a simple slip on modification to the existing Sennheiser twist lock ear cover with existing foam cover still attached. The reviews for the add-on ear pad were filled with complaints with replacements not fitting well, too small. I carefully slipped these on with a thin nail file; it's important not to stretch weak material do it stays. Initially, with the original pads, I want lining up the twist locks and I had the problem of the pads popping off until I aligned and locked them in. I don't have the problem other complained of with pad not staying on once locked properly. But you can see, I almost ran out of material but no adhesives required. Here's an Amazon link to replacement pads ordered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00LGEO1W2/ref=yo_ii_img"
R50SHAWY2GRQT,5,Best headphones out there for a person who can't hear a TV well.
R2934RE5PIF73Z,5,Good!Thank you!
R1Q6SG3M4OHU27,5,Very good quality sound and comfort and delivery.
R2XYQ4FRHQ13Z7,4,They work very good including the sound.  I use them mostly from my bed and find them a little large and bulky for this use.  I knew that ahead of time but still wanted them.
RWV66AZ0B9N4G,3,Not so bad.
R2GB0L8RUPV1QC,4,"I purchased these based on other positive reviews, and I have not been disappointed.  The set up is easy and sound fidelity is very good. I can hear background sounds on the program playing that I cannot detect on speaker. I like them for music videos as well since the sound is so clear and I can set the sound level I like without disturbing others in the house. Very good quality for the price."
R2H7CB56DMBWFD,5,It's been only a month and enjoying the sound quality. Was easy to set up. Update - It's almost two years now and it's working fine.
R2NF75C97FMEJ6,5,should have bought them years ago..
R394URP8845T35,4,Works fine except not that comfortable.  Seems to slip off the head when leaniing forward.  Otherwise OK.
R2ITBOKM9C9OL4,1,"I am very disappointed by the product received.<br /><br />To increase to 50% capacity, bass sounds cause a vibration in the horn on the right. It seems that this loose horn.<br /><br />Can the product they sent me has had a manufacturing defect, perhaps others do not have this problem, but the product I received is not what I expected."
R3LS7BEHWVZ3U2,5,Very satisfied so far. I have owned it for about a month.
R3MYEO0CKXPBMB,2,very disappointed. The sound was crackling even close to the TV. I ended up shipping it back after giving it a few weeks.
R1MQVSJV7D8OF1,4,I have always liked the product that's why I have bought 3 of them from you I am very hard of hearing and this has saved me from eviction. Without them my neighbors would've complained that the T.V. was to loud.
R24W46B4Y5NKIF,5,"Purchased for a gift, since I've previously purchased 3 others (eerrrr....make that 4)<br />This is going to keep the Mr and his boxing quiet so the Mrs can read!<br />They were very happy w/the purchase!"
R3GMIPYRQJ43MC,1,"After having used these for a few months, I'm not a happy camper. Straight out of the box, it made crackling sounds. If it's not tuned precisely, there's beeping galore. Even when you do have it tuned properly, expect to hear static if you move your head, and sharp, incredibly loud beeping after this first half hour or so of use. I was expecting a lot more from a Sennheiser product, and I'm sorry that I wasted my money on them."
R1B6V8QJV3QFAQ,1,Volume/tuning very poor!!
RPEE7LF1CU3ZD,4,My husband loves these. Great sound very comfortanle
RBPCJ1SK39NHO,4,Great!
R5Z9NZ0DPC509,5,Easy to install.  Comfortable to wear. Crystal clear listening.
R2W6E8PQDR983L,5,Works great! Can understand voices much better.
R944ZVHL77KKB,5,Very very good Im very happy with my purchase and it was a very quick delivery too concidering it was sent to Iceland very well done excellent ;)
R2V7RSCYWUZNNF,2,I was disappointed in the proformance. About every few minutes I get static loud enough to break my ear drum. I would  not buy another head set like the one I have.
RZ45DPNQ93AJJ,1,Had a really hard time setting this up with our TV. Eventually gave up and returned it.
R19UGWHISP2D2E,5,Very pleased with the RS-120. Excellent fidelity for the price and easy to set up.
R2BNZ3CJG5IK1Z,5,"Love this, I can watch TV in bed without disturbing the husband.  Sound is amazing."
R1C8MVBDQBRHH4,1,"If you want to be frustrated by:<br /><br />-Interference from all your electronic devices in your home.<br />-A good signal ONLY clear when a few feet from the station - other than that expect tons of noise.<br />-Has 3 channels, which all sound like crap.<br />-Very uncomfortable after more than an hour - your ears & head will hurt.<br />-Short cords.<br />-noise Noise NOISE."
R16JAJTU3ZJDXJ,5,"Performing very well, recommend it.  The surprise is the much high audio quality that the wired &#34;hi-fi&#34; headphone I was using before.  Dr. J.B."
R247Y4L24E74L1,1,Worked great for a while. Now there is lots of noise and static and I can't return them. Probably should look at a better set. These never really fit tight enough and would fall off. Maybe fell one to many times?
R2NMNJX3RHX6QN,4,Great reception throughout the house.  Now we can enjoy watching the tv show without disturbing others.
R3B77MJZDIRRV5,5,"This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product, for the money is the best thing going. My 1st pair lasted over 3 years. I can walk around the house and hear everything on the TV.  Great Product"
R2HG0U496ON970,5,my husband and I love them'
R312MYTFEF3N0V,4,Works as advertised.  I would have preferred over-the-ear headphones instead of on-the-ear headphones but I knew what I was getting before I ordered so can't complain.
R1ZZ4N84HOBW0,5,"I purchased 2 sets of these headphones over a year ago and they're still working fine.  I use them almost every day.  Before these, I went through several other brands of cheap wireless headphones.  They just wouldn't last.  These have met my expectations and I'm very pleased with them."
R129NGMEVKGGSP,5,Great sound and easy hook up.
R12WX66UE4BL94,3,I had to return this item because the AC adapter was defective. I reordered the same item and I'm waiting for the order to arrive. I'll let you know how the new one works.
RUVDXN2JGIC0L,5,"I've had two pair, and looking to get another. Probably the best audio investment I've made, ever. There is nothing more satisfying than being able to roam around with excellent sound. I've tested these to 100 feet, no problem. Great sound, maybe a tad bassy but all in all? Awesome. Buy a pair. You won't regret it."
RV3Z3KC7BGA23,1,"Didn't realize how much noise these wireless headphones have, constant white noise, will probably wired next time. Also, should charge when it is on stand, but half the time it doesn't make connection. Regularly try to reposition for 20 seconds in order to get connection. Bad design."
R1482I7MCIXZ3U,5,"Upon a recommendation from a friend, I bought this Wireless Headphone set to use while walking on my treadmill.  It's always hard to hear the tv while on the treadmill without turning the tv up so loud you can hear it down the block.  These headphones have wonderful sound quality, they fit snugly on my head/ears without being too snug...I can walk at a fast pace and do not ever feel like they are going to slide off.  The headphones charge on the base unit when not being worn, so that is a nice feature...you just take them off, turn them off, and place them on the charging stand.  They are always ready to go!  I use these also to watch tv in the wee hours when I am unable to sleep, but do not want to disturb my hubby's sleep.  Not one complaint here & highly recommend!"
RCEOA9AIYVCYM,5,"Love these!! Totally work, and if you have kids, you need these!"
R1BST27T9C2IZC,3,"The cons outway the pros for me on this one. They feel nice and light to wear and I love not having a cord in the way, but there is a constant static sound in the background no matter what channel I have it set to and no matter how much I futz with the tuner... it's like trying to pick up an AM radio station from 300 miles away from the nearest transmitter even though the base station is right in front of me. Oh, and don't you dare have them on with no audio playing out of your computer... if it's not broadcasting an actual sound, then it cuts out and blasts loud screeching static in your ears. What's worse is that turning them on for the first time during the day I can never tell if they're going to blast that static or not. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't."
R3GSXZO0KHGHXY,5,Excellent product. Ear pieces could stand to be a little larger for more comfortable listening
R30IT67ZECCJP6,1,It didn't end up being what we needed. I wish the description would've been better
RKPJC67XMIG7G,2,"Audio quality is fair.  These are supra-aural cans so they sit right on the wearer's ears, I found them fairly uncomfortable for wearing for any long duration.<br />What was the deal breaker is this kit's radio freqency connection and that the headphones do not have an auto-off switch.  Having to constantly adjust tune the receiver in the set due to RF drift and getting treated to a burst of static once the transmitter decides to shut itself off if it detects silence or forgetting to turn the headset off is annoying."
R2Z1SAOR3EW1VN,5,Work fabulous - finally a thing that works !!
R2HD01HNKIWDGP,2,will not pick up ether of the 2 TVs we have.  it gets no green light.  Maker does not get back to you by phone or email.  it is worthless without support
R1IFJSM3EWM24Y,2,won't stay on head; is heavy and bulky
R19OBFNFNSKNK7,4,Great product. The headphones are very clear and have good range and great battery life. In hindsight I would have bought one of the better models only because these get uncomfortable after several hours and the better models look like they have superior ear padding.
R3RS9DSB1IHA72,3,My dad has trouble knocking these out of reception when he uses these.  Good for most but not my 92 year old dad.
R3U4PRJNHOHI9S,5,They let me hear the words being said in movies
R3APKDTI7MTKQ9,5,Bought this as replacement for a set my husband uses.  He loves this and range is incredible.  Very good buy.
RWP3PGY4SZ9PU,5,Very Good Quality
RGGNEHIBKE2G9,4,Sound is great and keeps out other noises. Very happy with it
R5NC95Z4LC7H3,4,I've tried several different headsets. This is the first that produces sufficient volume.
R2PQUWH9SFORGS,5,"the are great, I can hear much clearer and my wife loves them too because she can watch her programs or listen to the radio with out the TV blaring ...."
RTWD5MTV1ZJO,5,Works!
R249W6KR7T26ML,5,No as good as the early model
R2WRNGLUEJRQBS,4,husband loves these headphones------wife likes them even more----ha ha----
R4Z89849B6WM8,5,Works fine; quick shipping; keeps me from hearing Fox News blah blah blah when the wife is watching it!
R1KWML67AEY4H0,4,They work very well.  I'm quite happy with them. The only drawback that I can find is they have to be tuned occasionally. It's easily done with a dial on the bottom of the headset
RYMLFOMMLVL2P,3,"This is a great product, when and if it feels like working.  I bought two pairs - one for my mother and one for my house when she visits.  She was absolutely thrilled with the product and the ability to hear TV with out blasting out neighbors.  She told my aunts and uncles how great they were and they all bought units.  A great gift for parents with any amount of hearing loss.  And even without hearing loss, I had to giggle the first time I used them and how fantastic the sound was, I could hear the tail of the shark monster as it swam away on the Syfy channel.<br /><br />So when the product is working it is just great -  However, both units failed within about 6 months.  My mom's replacement works well.  My replacement however didn't - I was sent back a truly sub-standard refurbished pair that had volume and power shorts worse than the pair I sent in - so I have sent them back and am hoping 3rd time is the charm."
R3OUSJLKHVIO26,5,"These are great wireless headphones for the price.  I wore out a much more expensive set, another brand, and my AV guy said he thought these were terrific for the price.  I was skeptical, but have found them to be great! I am a little hard of hearing and these make tv viewing wonderful. I highly recommend them.  I don't listen to music with them but use them for tv, movie viewing."
R3QZ4AXG9H5MFU,1,"wouldn't charge after a few days, returned the item"
R3M8AERKL56363,2,"The range on these headphones is excellent. I could hear music clearly and easily through walls and all around my house from the transmitter being in another room with the door closed. Sennheiser is a good company as well, but the only thing I didn't like about them that was really bad is that when the headphones are on idle for about a minute or two, they will cut off into a horrible loud static until sound is transmitted. Since I am a songwriter, taking a moment to write down the lyrics is a crucial part of my job when I find something I would like to sing about. I found another pair that doesn't cut off after being on idle, so I ended up going with those. I would give these a 1 star or no star, but I don't agree with the use of hate in any concept of a rating. Sounds bitchy. Lol Anyways, I hope my review helped."
R1WWB1IBCTSSQR,3,Haven't been able to get anything but static...will keep trying
R2AMBZ88FWSMSD,5,"Excellent headphones, light, comfortable, plenty of adjustment range to fit anyone, excellent sound. Have been using this headset for one year with no problems. Highly recommend it because it has all the features and quality I was looking for.  The only uncomfortable aspect is that I wear glasses and after 30 mins or so, the pressure of the headphones against the temples (arms) of my glasses is somewhat painful. I found an easy solution which is to raise the temples over the headphones. This is not a design problem of the headphones, I'd have the same issue with any headphones.  Note that when Person A is listening to the TV speakers and Person B is listening through the headphones, it will sound like there's an echo in the headphones. It's not an echo, it's just that Person B is hearing both the sound from the TV speakers and the sound from the headphones with a slight delay between the two. I don't think there's a remedy for that. Not a complaint as it's understandable that outside sound will be audible while wearing the headphones. It's a little disappointing to hear the two sounds but for me, I can get used to it easily so I still recommend this product highly.  UPDATE Dec 2, 2016:  After 1.5 years, the headphones are still working perfectly, great sound quality, very pleased."
R24G6INU2U4MJ1,5,"This is the perfect set of headphones that i needed. It will get loud if you wanted to. And the bass,  it's alsom"
R15R1C2A7IAWT4,4,"Work well - a little bulky, and unusual analog 'tuning' dial that I sometimes mistake for the volune"
R1UTG15UFJ7SYF,3,"I bought these bc my Husband is hard of hearing due to 35 yrs. of plant work,as soon as he starts watching Tv.the volume get turned up to raddel the windows.I got 2 pair so if the battery was dead on one we would have the other for back up,Wrong. One pair is awesome the other is crap I've tried not every thing but very close,I'm going to try and find a double dongle if there is such a thing and go from there, Don't do what I did and accidently let the return time run out before you realise you can't get them to work. the one that works though is really great easy hook up and great sound and the battery works a long time on 1 charge."
R116A7VI86K7LQ,2,It has really old fashion plugs.  I still have yet to get an adapter to try them out.
R1KMWAJDZAKOCC,5,Very nice for my husband who likes to watch TV late.
R1KSXBRM7JWHCC,3,ok
R27Y188MHEZHDH,3,"The sound quality of these headphones is great, but the headphones are so loose that if you look up or down, they just fall off."
ROGU0UNL68AAN,4,"These things work great. My second pair. And maybe after years of use I expect more. They aren't so much headphones as a tippy pair of speakers that rest on your head.<br />The good:<br />They do what I want them to do: deliver good television sound without disturbing anyone else in the house.<br />Rechargeable via a convenient, if cumbersome, stand.<br />Good battery life once it's recharged.<br />the highs are way better than listening from my soundbar or my tv speakers<br />Good range. I can walk around outside, walk into the next room, make a sandwich, all without losing signal from the other room.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Bass response sucks. If you want bass, you gotta move air.<br />They're heavy. They don't stay on my head if I tilt my head down even slightly<br />They're hot. In the summer I frequently sweat beneath the foam pads.<br />They're too large to use laying down. I never realized that I sometimes watch tv sideways (!) until I started wearing these at night.<br />They're not real adjustable. Ear cups could swivel more, allowing me to use just one earcup when laying down.<br /><br />conclusion: Since this is my second pair I obviously like them, but after years of use,  I realize they could be lighter and more conducive to the realities of watching tv at night on a couch. Next pair I'll spring for something a little more expensive."
R2UTJM0PD739SI,4,Great sound. BUT not for the person that moves around while listening. I can't even count the number of times the headphones have hit the floor because I have forgotten about them and leaned down.
R31KLY0OE0E5A8,5,"Love this headset-  WE have had many others and were OK but this one is great.<br />Highly recommend it<br />The only thing it does that is not so good is fall off my head if I walk around and bend over.  You have to use them sitting down, not so good if you try to do house work while wearing them"
R2VRNHUCL5C1CO,5,"Love being able to hear the TV without having the volume too loud for others !  The questions and comments on this product answered the big question of where do we plug it in.  Short version... If you can't make it work with TV , USE THE CABLE BOX.  I'm just thrilled to think about going back and watching some shows I had discarded as too hard to understand."
R2LS40HG1TWSYG,4,iNJOY THIS HEADPHONE
R2JQPCIMQDLXU2,5,This has became my best friend especially if waking up in the middle of the night and wanting to watch television and can't.  No I can without waking anyone else up.
R2VW31FGF3OTGY,5,"This is my second pair, the first one still works but headset a little broken will not work long distance.  Had for a long time. Woud buy again."
RPKO4NKSDJUHC,5,REALLY GREAT FOR AN OLD MAN!
R2YJXR6NM2KZAU,5,"Awesome sound,  easy setup."
R3N54QMRL3S6NG,4,Good
R4RQ5Y841SSCT,5,very good for tv
R15PY6MBJ83KA4,1,"it came in damaged, couldn't use it"
R2W89XVTBN1GQV,5,"Had this a few months and it is solid. If you are some type of audiophile, perhaps...and just perhaps you may find some flaw. I'm not super picky and I really like this. You hear sounds you never hear otherwise which is neat .. Like on the news you can a make out background talking when they show video. I can not hear any hiss even in silence. Keep in mind, the younger you are, the more sensitive your hearing of high frequency."
R1L0KMDPQAJNM9,3,volume does not stay ajusted.
RK9UJGS80RZJR,5,"Easy hook up, Comfortable, great sound. I would have preferred leather covers instead of fabric for the ear pieces. Over all great and worth the money."
R273T0ND4EVT3G,5,worked well fast delivery
R1SOV1CUJFSCQR,3,"Easy set up.  Worked good with music,but using it for TV wasn't great.  It picked up too much background noises and music which drowned out the dialog  of the actors and actresses.  It would have been nice if there was a way to tone down the background sounds.  The headsets kept falling off my head if bent forward."
RML2JKPX4302J,5,"Sound is good, works perfectly to date."
R1N8G6U26N94CW,5,"Purchased for my Mom. Her hearing aides had a roar and she never wore them. Now that she has these headphones, she is actually watching TV and can understand everything clearly.  They are wireless so she has the freedom to walk around the house and not miss a thing."
RONAIQYHDZDP9,4,"I bought these so I could watch TV late night and not keep my fiancee up.  My TV did not have a coax audio, I could only use them through the headphone jack, which muted the TV for others.  I did not want to have to get up and plug into the headphone jack after she went to sleep.  I had to purchase a digital to analog converter to make them work on my set.  But since I got that I am very impressed with these headphones!  They sound great."
RMVUOT6PTLKLL,1,We have had major issues with the headset. We used the RCA adapter supplied and wonder if that is the issue. We only use it for our TV which is about 15 feet away. It goes from working beautifully to randomly going static and stays there. Any suggestions.
R283GOYJ5BZ9B1,3,Cannot adjust headset to fit.  Unable to mute on commercials.  Generally not what I was hoping for.
R1EWFD3TPPST71,4,It wouldn't hurt if the instructions were a little more detailed. I found it a rather difficult to adjust the volume and tuning while wearing the headphones which you must do.
RZO2ZACLPRDGU,5,Excellent sound.
R12WIMPWFR6352,5,"Great headphones, my wife tried them on and said it sounds like your in a concert hall. Great sound and battery lasts a long time and recharges quickly."
R2W46DA5ILO3EW,5,"Wonderful.  I am hard of hearing which means for me to hear the TV, the sound is way to high for my Wife's comfort.  Hooked up properly, the headphones are totally independent of the regular sound from the TV.  Also, if there is a annoying conversation taking place you can just turn up the volume."
R3FYB27IH2IW0Z,4,Good product works pretty far into my yard but keeps falling off my head!
R3C4RLPXAP8OMH,1,the adapter did not fit in the Samsung tv
R3J9UDC2ZBX2A8,3,"Had these for about a week now and would say they are ok. I dont know if I got a bad set, or if my expectations are just not correct, but I do not think I would buy these again for 80. Sounds quality is 7 of 10. Headset quality is 7 of 10 as well. Meh..."
R3L1Z4N9M3RITZ,5,"I purchased the RS120 Headphones because my wife often goes to sleep early and I was always disturbing her by watching TV.  After doing some basic research, reading reviews of several headphone, this one seemed to meet my requirements.  Everything I needed to attach the charging unit to the TV came with the headphones.  I read the instructions, but it was so intuitive that really did not need to.  The headphones work as advertised.  I can walk throughout the house and still hear the program that is on.  The headphones come with a set of rechargeable batteries.  Instructions were to charge the batteries in the headphones for 24 hours prior to first use.  I happen to own a 15 minute charger.  I fully charged the batteries, put them in the headphones and was ready to use in 15 minutes.  Bottom line I would recommend this headphone set."
R3CRSVSZLOL2D4,5,"Very easy set up. No problems so far,"
R3IQW9FVTD5J1X,5,"Have used wireless headphones for a number of years to hear the TV when I'm in the kitchen, or other room.  Used RCA in the past but when they weren't available I went looking for something else.  Found these and am most happy with them.  Sound is better than my old RCA's.  Had no problem with connecting them to my TV since I already had the RCA connectors in place.  Took just a couple of minutes to get the tuning set.  Headset works better for me also.  Only brief problem I had setting them up was connecting the power cable.  Was a tight fit, and couldn't get my finger in closer to push better.  Finally got it to where I knew it was firmly connected."
R1NHLR8AVJBBYL,5,"This wireless headset works great.  Can walk anyplace in the house and in the yard and they have the range to still function normally.  The sound quality, for me, is very good - better than listening to the speakers on the 55 inch flat screen.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
R1HLFNJORGTVG6,4,It works very good just as it said it would.
R1S1H9TR6C0XJT,5,"great item, my second set. use one in the living room, and the other set is in my mancave"
R278ZMDM5H4EED,4,"After finally figuring out how to place it properly and tune it into my amp, it works pretty well--even continued to broadcast clearly down one floor to the kitchen when I went for some goodies. I bought an extra headphone set, but can only charge one at a time, according to the maker (though I can fit both on the stand). Doesn't fit on my head as tightly as I'd want--so watch your moving around or they may tend to fall off. Also, make sure you place the stand as far from the amp as you can (like they recommend); otherwise it won't work hardly at all."
R2ZAV6XHT79I6X,5,"I've had one for many years and bought this one for my daughter. I love mine and she loves hers. I wear mine throughout the house and out back so I never miss a thing with the shows I'm interested in following. It comes in handy for someone who wants to watch TV when there is company over playing cards, having fun, making noise and they don't care to play. The TV is muted and doesn't bother the game players and the game players don't bug the TV watcher..aka party pooper. :-)"
R2S0D9BMHRFBUU,5,Outstanding head set.  Gave our inexpensive flat panel TV set sounds like a movie theater.
RGOIYEJ32MTIU,5,holds a charge for a long time and the sound quality is very good
R3G6CEWDJYY6BU,5,Serves it's purpose. Headphones themselves are comfortable.
R3BXQSCVFJIPN3,5,I've been using these for 4 years. After a while the volume control goes loose. A pain but still worth the price.
R294Y5CGQA3NC1,5,"For me the set up easy, I thought I'd have to play with the frequency adj., but out of the box It so clear no static at all.<br />I'm thinking of buying another set. I had purchased a different type before and kept getting a clicking noise in the headphone unless I turned my head a certain way. I'd say buy'em they're super."
R2HA3OH6VTPE5A,4,Great product! Mom has hearing loss and she now can enjoy all her TV programs without her hearing aid.
RTFF90RVTJGHJ,5,Works well would be better if I could use the music downloads from prime but can't get it working for Firefox
R31AA8ME6ZZXI6,4,great
R2IGAHHS8EWVK5,5,Love my new headphones.  I was familiar with this particular pair of headphones so  they are everything I expected. They were shipped promptly and I am a happy camper
R3EXRUD10PM57J,5,The only earphones I use and recommend them to all my friends who are hearing impaired.
R31R1Y5RNAS364,5,Works great.
RW698YNSXM8XV,4,Good
R3EYJGUWQV6E1B,3,Have to keep tuning them in. Very annoying. May be return them if the problem continues.
R1HVMZ93RX8LSI,1,Terrible!  Do not buy these headphones.  They are not comfortable and they easily slide off of your head.  They also hiss constantly and if your audio source stops for a short while they will hiss so loudly that your ears will bleed.  They were so frustrating that I sent them back and bought the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Headphones.  Best decision ever!  The BackBeats are absolutely amazing in every way possible.  Everyday I love them more and more.  Spend the extra money and buy the good stuff.
R3AMLEGUQ2S4VF,5,"We bought them for my 90 year old step-mother for her birthday and she is thrilled with them. She can really enjoy watching TV now without worrying about disturbing the neighbors and, most importantly, can hear every spoken word clearly. She can tune to a music channel and listen to it outside her apartment, 20 yards away in the common area. They're RF vs IR. The headphones are pretty light weight and comfortable. Tuning for the best signal can be a little touchy because her hands shake but that's what I'm there for. Ordinarily there is no frequency drift and no adjustment is necessary. I only had to help her with the tuning once since she got them."
RBCWOHCB87629,5,"Great set of headphones. The sound is excellent, and I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone."
RB2YPOEVD4KQB,1,It worked once in my mother's nursing home. Now I got it to transmit cnn. Even when I changed channels only cnn was heard and there was lots of static. Then it seemed to be transmitting another channel than the one that was on or it was a radio station. These products are just too iffy. I can't go to the nursing home every day to check it. It turned out to be a loss of $50.
RHHHHN2QK5X5S,5,"I've had these for over a month now, and am very satisfied. I have some high frequency hearing loss, so I use them while watching TV and can hear everything. The sound quality is excellent ... rich and clean with no hiss or static once the signal from the base is tuned in using the Tune dial on the headset. They are very light-weight and comfortable. These are a nice improvement over an older set of inexpensive Sony wireless headphones that finally quit working. I like the use of commonly available rechargeable batteries. If I had to mention any downside, it would help if the Tune dial were &#34;detented&#34; instead of free-turning which would help prevent accidental de-tuning. But this is minor in my opinion. I would recommend to anyone."
R8REQI6D3Z5NP,5,My second set so I don't have to move between outputs
R1MMFRAXYQ2R5M,3,Supplied Ni-Cad batteries won't stay charged for more than a few hours. I ended up using alkaline batteries instead.
R2H5Q2WWW47YET,5,Greatest headphones! The price was right too! Like being in a concert hall!!
RXL8VRWMAOKXH,2,they stopped working all together not even a year after purchase
R1R05OL97NCW62,5,works great!! wasy setup and sounds really good!!
RQMXKBKH40PKR,5,"Great headphones! I got them 2 years ago for my husband as a Christmas present. I love the charging station, great sound, we can listen to music or keep listening to the movie while walking around the house. Best headphones we've had."
R6XK74JKAXUDM,4,I am partially deaf and was hoping I could get a higher volume from these. This is my third attempt and so far the closest to what I need
R2GRQVURR91S7Y,4,Comfortable to wear with great sound.  We also purchased a second headset.  Excellent quality of workmanship and priced right.  Prime delivered these to Hawaii in less than a week.
R1IDLE6ZCN754E,3,"These work well when used as most would probably use ~ in the house, in the room where the tv is! :-) However, I believed the marketing that stated it would work even through walls up to 150 ft. Frequently and why I bought them was I use them on the patio and watch the tv in the living room from outside the sliding glass doors. The signal is clear sometimes, but frequently I loose the signal or get a loud squelch and sometime must adjust the signal on the headset. I had a well know electronics store set for many years that worked awesome in this exact way for much less cost. They do work very well as I described when used as most will use it, so for those it would be 4 or 5 stars, so I will give it a 3 star sense I am not real happy with the longer range use and through the sliding glass door (even at this relatively close distance it sometimes is not very clear and without that ear bugging squelch."
R1RFJXDXDCL146,5,Stopped the wife from yelling at me because the TV was to loud.
R1JM6Z20TWJ4BG,5,they are great go all over the house and yard and never lose the music
R92DM1XT8L441,3,"Well I bought this because my old Sony set finally gave out after about 8 yrs of happy use. The Sony costs $50 at that time. I bought this because it is a Sennheiser so you cant go wrong, right? It is ok but does not sound any better than the Sony and does not fit very well. As long as you keep your head still no problem. But if you get up or lean foward they slip off your head! It lacks a bit on the deep end and has a hiss but not all the time. Aside from the slippage issue I can live with these phones, otherwise I would give a 4 star. I paid $80 now I see em for $69! I would say $50 is fair."
R2A5XSASS397CZ,5,Wow - these devices have come a long way.  I replaced a 7 or 8 year old device and when I put this on the sound was spectacular.  It fits comfortably and securely and is crystal clear.  I am an old guy and sometimes use it just to hear when my wife tells me to turn the TV volume down.
R1E4WU8KXLJFG8,5,Just love it. Have owned it for 3 years and they are still like new. Has never had a problem. The name says everything.
R28CBDGDGY5TGJ,5,Excellent sound reproduction.  Good reception a surprising distance from the receiver even through two walls.
R8O8OITY8TWK5,2,Something is wrong with the headphones.  It worked for about a week and stopped.  Is there something I can do to fix it without sending it back.
R2AWOKTGHIUY65,5,These are amazing! I can watch tv and my husband doesn't have to listen to the tv on at night!!! Very happy with this purchase!!
R1XODFU6GF2RKU,1,It works shortly after the signal is going  terrible signal i lose my money
R1IUKYGIJE8RFO,1,Never worked.
R181AB1UOQZII,5,"Bought these wireless headphones and decided to wait 7 months to review.  Well I loved them from the first and still do. High quality sound that I use for TV and Online Computer which includes my music collection and streaming videos.  The only improvement which I improvised is an additional head strap to secure it on my head. You wouldn't want to drop them into the sink while cooking and listening. By the way I paid $98 for them here in October 2014, so these are really a buy at the new lower price."
R3C005IK61K7SN,1,"There is nothing anywhere on the product description or instructions that explain THESE DO NOT WORK ON TVS WITH DIGITAL AUDIO OUTPUT, mainly any TV models produced in the past 2 years.  After reading through the many other 1-star ratings, I found one person who described the problem and what he did to fix it--spend another $50 in parts to adapt it.  I really don't want to do that, but since I am already in this far, might as well.  Amazon should do a better job of policing its products' claims."
R1B4A6YEXW08AZ,5,Best wireless headphones I've ever owned.  Great reception over long distances away from base.  Great price.
R1QMD4YUOKWD9F,1,"After 2 hours of trying to set them up, like many other reviews, the headphones just wont connect.  The auto shutoff happens every 5 minutes.  Very disappointed with the purchase.  I was really looking forward to using them."
RKEO64AJPNHRW,5,"Very happy with these.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent.  I tend to stay up very late watching t.v. from bed.  My wife likes to turn in earlier.  Although I can hear the t.v. loud and clear with these, my wife right next to me says she does not hear a sound.  So they are perfect for our purposes."
R2VZZEMUL4XXT0,5,Bought these for my 99 year mother to replace TV Ears that quit working.  She said that these are &#34;10 times better&#34; than the TV Ears.  We aren't bothering with TV Ears anymore.  You shouldn't either!!!
R3OIEB5RPC0AEC,5,The sound quality surpasses my former headset.<br /> The detail in the sound is outstanding!
R2HC494SJBM15P,4,"The sound quality is good (great bass!) and I don't have much trouble with interference despite living in the suburbs and having a lot of gadgets in my home.  My only complaint is that the transmitter (not the headphones) automatically shuts off after a minute or so of not getting audio which causes the headphones to emit a loud static hiss directly into my ears.<br /><br />For example, if I'm watching a DVD with the headphones on and I pause it to go grab a snack, if I don't turn the headphones off I'll be in the middle of looking through the fridge or something and suddenly I'll be startled by static from the headphones.  Or if I'm browsing the web and I put them on to listen to a YouTube clip and go back to silent web browsing but forget to turn them off I'll get startled after a minute.<br /><br />If the headphones automatically shut off as well it would make sense, since it would be saving their battery (and not hissing in my ears), but I can't fathom why it helps anything to shut off the transmitter.  Does it save a little bit of electricity?  Does it cut down on needless EM radiation?  I wish I could at least set the timeout to half an hour or something..."
R24VFWQU6Z6SWJ,2,not like my old set  .i have old set that is mush better set
RPDC1WMYML0U6,5,"Use it all the time, great quality sound and reasonable distance!"
R23X85ISS1H2OW,5,"Article, fulfills its objective to fully"
R14TY1EBCBKVCC,2,Many issues with the connection between the base and the headset. Signal would go I'm and out even when stationary right next to the base. Would have really loved these had they worked..
R2DY4VIQ25RDY8,4,"I would rate this RS120 as 31/2* it does the job very well, but, has several cons: very bulky, will slide of your head very easily, the tuner also<br />controls the volume somewhat so it is a little hard to keep it tuned. This sounds like I am giving a bad review, but all wireless headphones I<br />have had or seen have some problems. In the case of RS120 the good far outweigh the bad, I could have returned it but I did not because it<br />has good sound for private listening to  tv or music. (hint= I found an elastic band in a drawer and added velcro to each end and attached to<br />earphone arms and no more sliding off)"
R1ETP0QTRWBGA2,2,Returned. Defective amplifier
R249E7BGLQ9Q1I,5,I love these and I use them all the time!! The only way to make them better was if the charging stand was able to be farther away from the TV so I could have them set right next to my bed.
R1XVP4N6PK6DWH,1,SENT IT BACK --TOO COMPLICATED TO INSTALL FOR SENIORS--NEEDED OTHER COMPONENTS TO INSTALL IF TV DOES NOT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK--
RL6LHPVR49VEX,5,Bought these for my non tech savvy dad and he loves them.  Great gift for any household where mom and dad have differing likes in entertainment!
R209LB39WIB7XL,5,Great sound
R3Q7N6372GXGCI,5,Saved my marriage!
R2N6ABKHHLIZNL,5,"Love this. My 97 year old Grandma had to move in with us and we quickly realized that I like the TV at 15% volume and she liked it at 80% volume. These saved my families ears. They were easy to operate, even for Grandma."
R3BZVSA9W9EIJ6,3,"Sound quality is very good, but you have to fine tune frequently. Perhaps it is because the tune control is right next to the volume control and is easily moved or perhaps it is because the transmitter or receiver drifts or maybe both. Either way it is not teh greatest design. I expected better from Sennhieser."
R3OI749K93ZASZ,3,it is so hard to find a clear channel. You either end up with a clear channel with low voice level or a channel with high voice level with some static
RGI3NU268EV0E,5,I love the headset they are very clear
R1RRNHV967ETV6,3,"these work fairly well, but if you don't place the headphones on the holder exactly right they won't charge, and you won't know it until you go to use them the next time around."
R2O499M882MBPN,5,"These headphones are very comfortable and sound very good. My roommates go to bed early and get up early. I am a night owl and needed a way to be able to watch TV late at night without waking up the house. These fit the bill nicely. More than loud enough. Also, you pick up on many more sounds and details wearing these versus listening through your television speakers. Have DirecTV, and initially plugged it into there for sound. Had lip synch issues and couldn't figure out how to fix them. Eventually I figured out my TV set itself had audio out, so tried that instead. Voila, no more lip synch problems. Very good product. Bought them because I had previous good experience with Sennheiser headphones I purchased for my mp3 player. Another successful product by them for me. Not noise cancelling, but that wasn't in description so not an issue. Happy with their quality so much that I even wear them if I am home alone."
RC88OKCKPX3P0,1,"We spent 45 minutes trying to get the power cable to plug into the power unit to turn the unit on. It wasn't only difficult, it was impossible! Found a dinky piece of paper in the box that looked as if you are supposed to push the top of yellow cable with more force into the power station. No writing on it, no explanation as to what may be the issues that you should try to avoid or overcome. For heaven's sake, my husband is a mechanical engineer with two master's degrees and has always been able to figure out how to connect electronic units to anything and everything. Absolutely this is going back and we intend to express our profound disappointment that a formerly great company like Sennheiser has so poorly designed or allowed this unit to be so poorly manufactured."
R1QZ1BHJMOADS7,1,I have 4 golf buddy all work fine except the new LR5 Battery lasted about 10 hits. Called tech support got no help at all. Told they would try to get new battery. Will see if they can get one. Must be hard to find a battery.
R3VWB95RQ1GHWA,4,A big help to my husband.  He just now has to learn how to adjust them.  They do the job.
R1P8ASB2FX8YYI,3,"Having trouble charging the headphones. I have another pair and they sit perfectly on the charger. These sit the same exact way, but the charging light does not stay lit. What can I do?"
R3JTE331TJEEQL,5,These work really well as I can mute the TV sound to not disturb others but still hear every nuance of sound! Excellent!
R20LHVCYHQ0B3I,4,"I have previous experience with an older version of this product, Still. I needed to go to UTUBE for instructions on setting up the tv connection. Not enough explanation of video connection either. I'm not much of a techie but am in the age range of those whose hearing faculties are diminishing and want this type of accessory so as not to disturb others with our own need for volume."
R1ZDA6Z391L7U9,5,Love it
R3CR26A6RZ2U57,3,They sound great... I just wish they would stay on my head a bit better. (too loose)
RG7874ZXGFXZG,5,"I live in a noisy college building and have come to rely on these during those nights when I don't want to blast my TV to drown out the surrounding chaos. While I have not worn the headphones from full charge to empty, I have worn them for as long as 4 hours without losing a charge. The sound, while having a little static when more than 30 feet away, is fairly clear and reliable. I would have paid double for these headphones and am impressed with the quality that comes at this price. I have grown to trust Sennheiser and this is another one of their stellar products.<br /><br />**Note: I have a TV that did not have an audio out. As a result, I had to buy a Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable and a Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adaptor in order to connect the headphones to my TV. I bought them both from Amazon and included the links below.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7GSW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DIRI6I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
R3JTFESI2N9PG8,2,"Very uncomfortable after a few minutes.  During commercials, when I took them off to give my ears a rest, the channel button would get moved a tad and when I put them back on I would get a blast of loud static.  My Jensen TV was not fully compatible in that I could not mute or turn down the volume on the TV without it doing the same to the headphones.  This is the TV's fault.  I could go into the TV's settings and turn off the TV's speaker without affecting the sound in the headphones. If I didn't, there was too much delay between the two to tolerate.   My ultimate solution was to get Bluebuds X by Jaybird.  I still have to turn off the TV's speakers but woo hoo! they are great and I can listen with one earbud off in case the dog wants out or a burglar wants in.  Could not do that with the headphones. Same price at my Best Buy as at Amazon ($124)."
R37EUKQAL8HNM4,2,I was surprised to open the box and find no adaptor cable to plug the headphones into. Who sells a product without sending the adaptor to use it.<br />I am very disappointed!<br /><br />This is my second Sennheiser. I like the headphones a lot but no very happy right now.
R6I1PFJGTXA26,2,I hear on it but the connection is  not great
RKMPILNWOTBPJ,5,Great sound and easy to hook up
RXWLD59CCHC0T,4,I like the charging station! I HEAR THE SOUND SO MUCH BETTER THAN WITH MY HEARING AIDS!
R15SW5L7MKYRD1,5,"Excellent head phones for my dad.<br />He's hard of hearing, elderly, and hasn't &#34;clearly&#34; heard the TV for more than 15 years now.<br />He's now enjoying the TV on a regular basis."
R66GERI0K1ILI,5,This set of headphones did everything we were told they would do and easy to use.
R3JZ0AMCXM47MP,5,Easy to use and works well with Television. Purchased for elderly person who had difficulty hearing television and videos at normal volume levels. Charges well and tunes in for clarity well.
RJ0FUF1WLEFMQ,2,"With the newer TVs, not all headphones are compatible.  They work through the DVD player,  or when we watch Netflix, but won't work when just watching regular TV. Kind of a disappointment, as I wanted them for when my husband watches the news at night so he doesn't wake the kids."
RO8R8PRKMU6YD,1,Could never get them to work properly. They would work for a few minutes and then cut out. Would not recommend.
R65TF3ZU1APMV,1,Can't seem to figure out how to get this thing to work!
R3LAZ1I9F0204D,4,"It does what it's supposed to. A lot of reviews about the buzzing, but you have to really listen for it for it to bother you. Kind of heavy but the easy charge stand is awesome. Best wireless headset in this price range."
R216AHHMDU7XCI,4,"Nice product. Very comfortable. Excellent range. Decent sound for the price.<br />The only reason for 4 of 5 stars, and if anyone out there could help me I would appreciate any feedback... to cradle and charge the phones, to get them to stay in the charge position is past annoying.<br />This may just be one of those form over function things.<br />I have owned 2 Sony wireless sets and popping the 'phones in the cradle to charge was simple... this one? You have to mess with it time and time again to keep the charge indicator on."
R3DB6JMAK0KCQ7,4,"they are good head phones but for the price shouldn,t have to tune them to you tv"
R2030FPT118L00,4,I would recommend unless you have small head.  I got these because I don't hear well.  I need TV much louder than others.  I like that I can hear dialog even if I leave the room.  Work well very clear sound.  I have what I consider a average sized head for a woman yet these are big.  If I bend my head down they tend to fall forward.  I use them when others are in the house.  Wish they could be adjusted smaller.
R2GQWPTD52F82X,4,Good fidelity sound.
RUDYMAC8NIHVW,5,Awesome headphones! My mom uses them for the TV and can hear everything perfectly!
R1JVZJJA16EHH1,5,"My husband has used this unit for several years and he is very happy with it.  I bought one for my mother and so far so good, as they say."
R1JX3VO02PEZ5I,5,meets my needs perfectly.
RY6KW5TTV738K,2,"It gets loud static when the signal is weak or you stop playing audio.  Cheap material.  doesn't fit well.  Not typical Sennheiser quality.  You get what you pay for and I got this for a steal.  Its sitting on my desk at work and I'm probably going to replace it with something else maybe bluetooth so I don't get the hiss and static when a track finishes,  Would have been 1 start but I got it for ~$40"
R20I3XBQ9BZR47,5,"Excellent.  Easy to install, works very well.  You can set TV to mute while using the headset if no one else is watching the TV.  Has volume control,  tuning control & power switch on headphones.  Headphones charge on stand when not in use."
RYHWMPPOUKNXC,5,Very pleased with this unit. Very easy for me to move the unit to either room's television. I also like that I can also use them even if another person in the room listens to the tv speakers. I find the sound quality to be better than that through tv speakers. I haven't tried using them at their maximum rated distance but they work great no matter where I am in the house or patio.
R1ZOOGF0IENCP0,4,"Love them. Comfortable and good sound. Only reason not 5 stars is that I get a little back ground hiss. Could be I need to move transmitter to different location. So far, charging going ok. Would definitely by again."
R2S5YPJQYX3RU3,5,"Very nice.  Sturdy, long lasting, good fidelity ... worth every penny."
R379XXLBSSQCHT,5,Just what I wanted. Works great.
R1IWE27ETKWJX7,5,Wonderful!  I can hear so clearly without having the TV turned on high. The sound surprised me.  Such a much better quality than on any TV I've seen.  Thanks!
R155JPTZ90GV,5,"PROS:<br />These things are beasts as far as sound clarity.<br />The RF signal sounds way better than Bluetooth.<br />The speakers seem like they're lasting forever without any degradation.<br />Tunes really easily with good range.<br />Lasts extremely long between charges (I've never had them die on me, even after 10+ hours of continuous use).<br />CON:<br />The only slight annoyance is that if you don't have sound going through them for more than a minute or two, they'll start BLARING static really loudly. The same goes for when you turn them on: you have to start playing sound with them off, and THEN turn them on after in order to avoid the static.<br />OVERALL:<br />The sound quality is worth it, especially for the price I paid for them!"
R3KW2IKG9C2D90,4,"WORKS FINE, BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE TO ADJUST THE TONE TO GET LOUD RECEPTION.  WORKS MORE THAN THE 300 FT. DISTANCE FROM THE T.V.  GLAD I BOUGHT IT.  WIFE REALLY LIKES IT SO THAT SHE  DOESN'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO SPORTS GAMES."
R3R2I3V0RSNKKI,5,This item works terrific and easy setup. Can go room to room with no problems
R2O4P1VB2EH35A,5,Works very good.
R7E6H5N3R6BWI,5,This product was really easy to assemble and fast. The headphones are very comfortable. Very pleaser with the port so far.
RL9P2LXTPI8PP,5,It's awesome.........my wife now has some peace and quiet and I can watch TV as loud as I need to be to enjoy it...........
R3R19Z8CV6XS4U,5,These are so nice. I really enjoy them. Let's me watch TV at night and not disturm my husband.
R1JFPLCJ00DXLS,5,"I bought this for my Mother In Law who is hard of hearing and was always worrying about the TV volume being too loud. She says they are very comfortable and other headphones she used she had a hard time understanding the words, but with these the words are very clear. She loves them."
R2GIM0BN56Q7LY,5,"Bought for my father in a nursing home. These were replacements for Brookstones that lasted less than two years (one of the two headphones stopped working). On the other hand, these are better in every way so far. The best feature is how easy they are to charge..just put them on the stand. They have very clear and strong reception. The only question I have is why they did not set up to show when fully charged; LED indicator light stays on continuously."
R3QOAWCDHFW76Q,5,"This product exceeded my expectations, and the price was the lowest listed. I wear the headphones all over the house and outside listening to music. For the price you can not beat the quality of sound you get."
RHAPVSH9LDNR4,5,"When I ordered this item, I was unser f the person I ordered it for would really use it.  To my surprise, he uses it all the time.  he is really pleased with the quality of the sound.  He raves that it is just like being there.  I am really pleased with the results from this headset.  It is easy to use.  Just be sure to let it charge before using."
R2NXS33MKBJZLD,5,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 a couple of weeks ago and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to hear with them having only 40% of my hearing and wearing very strong behind the ear hearing aids.  For those of you that wear hearing aids or with hearing problems and are in the market for wireless headphones, believe me these work great.  I can either turn my aids down low with no squealing and even take them completely off and can hear the TV just fine.  My wife is so happy now that she can listen to the TV at a much lower volumn.  If you want wireless headphones and have a hearing problem I highly recommend these!"
R4YVAJS2E1TJH,4,"These are quite nice headphones, fit is moderately comfortable, they could be improved by the addition of a mute button."
R2FQ05UN0N77P,1,"Don't bother buying this one.  There is little positive to say, in fact nothing positive about this one.  The headphones slide off the head, the signal kept dropping even though I was less than 10 feet from the base.  There was a lot of noise in the background."
R1BS201Q7RO8BK,4,"Works as advertised.  Much better sound, range and reception compared to what I had before."
R1CPJHU27CFMN9,1,"Got these for our new flat screen, after 5 hours on two separate days could not get these to work. They will show charging but then uncharged, can't get any signal to the TV either. Really disappointed. :("
RJM07M2WSGNP6,5,"GOOD SOUND,COMFORTABLE"
RMSNSU1VW6ITW,5,These are great! I'm living in a loft so they allow me to watch tv upstairs in peace without disturbing family downstairs! Definitely glad I purchased! :)
R1D90B10O09XWM,4,I like these headphones and most things are great.  But position of ear pieces maks them loose and they fall off when i tip my head forward.<br />Otherwise excellent in sound and range.
R1N2OPUSCN6YGQ,5,This has saved my marriage....
R2HUKLMB1IHPPJ,2,"Product is heavy, bulky and tends to easily fall off your head.  Battery doesn't last that long and the fm hiss makes this a product I would not buy again.  The signal is fine near the unit, but the headphones are not very mobile due to the static and heavy, bulky construction."
R2TDJLRJ2Y0MP1,5,"These headphones have been amazing! In a household with a baby and someone who works night shift, I'm able to watch tv and not wake anyone. Highly recommended!"
R1TKS6E5HBHZGW,5,"Bought these for my husband after pricing out other models, most of which were well over $100. He's been using them for about 5 months now, 1-2 hrs a night. I've never heard a complaint from him. And you can't beat this price!"
R2DDQZWWL6UNIA,4,"Headphones are great except, they don't fit your head snug enough. They will fall off if you lower your head: ex. to pick up something or if you just bend your head down."
R3CAJNE5QCFQNO,5,"I really like this set.  Ordered a 160, and just hate it.  This one is open ear, although a bit heavy on the head, plenty of volume, easy charge."
R1UVDIM3QRDQOC,3,the only thing i would like to see changed on these is the channel tuning.  the tuner dial is located directly below the volume dial and is easily bumped when adjusting the volume. a multiple position switch would be better
R2CXDDGWVZTTU0,4,"Love the headphones so far.  Had just a few months.  I dropped to 4 (should be 4.5 maybe) stars only because I find the headset slips easily on my head.  I have very short, straight hair and I suppose that contributes.  I wish I could find someway to keep them more stable on my head as I like to move around a lot in the house while listening and they keep sliding front or back if I move around a lot.  But they are very comfortable and the sound is great.  I suppose if something was done to make them sit more firmly they wouldn't be as comfortable, don't know.  Just what I needed/wanted for listening to Sirius, etc., from my satellite TV.  I move around from room to room and always get a very good signal from one end of the house to other.  Super easy to set up - pretty much just plug in and turn on."
R3Q61RZTZPH3I2,5,Great sound full stereo effect. Easy to set up and enjoy.
RQ3PF8H2HYWDP,5,Solid.
R1PG6AGEM88AMM,5,sounds great and works great!
R2Q3BYIR60O6S7,4,"Wireless headphones work great around the house listening to TV.  Can go into garage and still hear TV/stereo.  Clear crisp sound.  Would have liked a little more padding on the top of headphones.  Ear area has soft foam, would have liked a little thicker quality foam for ears."
R22T4QD4JV1PND,4,I bought these for my hard of hearing mother so that she could watch tv without disturbing her neighbors.  She loves them!  My only complaint is that the volume and the tuning dials are placed so that they are easily disturbed when putting on or removing the headphones.
R26TYCR0DS07Z3,5,Well worth the price I paid
RU781JVZ6XNY5,5,"This fits the bill for me, I am hard of hearing, from spending so much time on the police firing range without the proper hearing protection. Now I am able to listen to tv, without running everyone else out of the house with the high volume."
R1CYUC3R4O11HA,5,Great sound.  Musses the hair a drop!
R1UHK2XCU9YJ5Y,5,happy with purchase
R13KZ2B78PQ44S,3,"excellent sounds, bass and surround details.  not very comfortable headset. excellent range of wireless but it has very disturbing background noise and connection noises. tried all the channels and the noises keep coming"
R3B2M48NXLQO3F,1,Bought two of these products but they do not even power up. The power adapter cord and the location where it is inserted is very cheaply constructed. Expect more from Sennheiser. Might as well settle for a cheap product.
RFMHX97GJBDDU,5,VERY GOOD RECEPTION
R9SUQBEFASXXK,5,"Fast shipping, high quality product. Very satisfied."
R1K7AL7K164I9M,5,"They work great.  I use on my computer, iPad and TV - very nice."
RJW3I43O73WMC,5,"These headphone simply work.  My wife and I have some hearing degradation and this solves having to turn the TV up to 'Shake the roof'.  We also hear more detail and finally get some things we have missed.  These are great for those with some lack of hearing, or who needs to have little to no noise yet wants to watch TV."
R3CZKHBP8V5LAE,5,"These work great for my elderly mother-in-law. Simple to use, simple to charge and very good quality sound. The tuning and volume adjustment dials are very close together. Once tuned in we taped over the tuning knob to assist with inadvertently knocking out the frequency. Other than getting her familiar with them they work perfectly and she loves them."
R120VV48NDOK44,2,"Don't waste your money.  I have several friends with this model and with all the positive reviews, so I figured it must be a nice set of headphones. Boy was I wrong. All three of my friends described them as total garbage.  I wish I'd ask them before I purchased. Four people with the same complaint, constant hiss and dropped signal.  2 stars because is does on occasion work adequately"
R3U13OYG3UQ0LP,5,"This is an awesome product.  Works perfectly. No sound loss, crystal clear sound, and works for a very long distance and manages obstacles efficiently."
R1X8K0QAB3O3OB,5,Perfect and that includes the stereo separation that also is amazing and perfect
R2LIQ17H3NAFA8,4,"I like the range, clarity and tone.  Good quality.  Only complaint is I wear hearing aids and the ear pieces hurt my ears with my aids in place.  I have ordered some softer ones but they are not here yet, hope they work out."
R3UR05KBKPWDNT,4,Damn these are some good wireless headphones. I got the use/repackaged ones for cheaper and am very pleased. so pleased i had my mom get a set for my almost deaf father so we don't have to hear car chases and shoot outs at 2 AM. i can walk around the house with these on. very nice when listening to music. or when i need to get a snack while watching a TV.
R12JNJ6DJ9P89B,5,"Works very well, only improvement would be a more conformal over-ear fit"
R232NRUXCACMJO,5,very good i used it every day when nobody  want to hear the tv . one small promble head set keep falling off..thank you
R19I1TR61CSZ4Z,5,"sound is clear, the headset is comfortable and it works great.  Worth the money."
R1NINH8OTFZYG1,5,"These headphones are very good for the money. The only problem I've had with them is the location of the tuning control.  My wife, who uses them the most, hits the tuning control.  The problem was solved with a piece of tape."
R2A29BI01LKRPY,1,"I installed the Sennheiser 120 on my TV set in a bedroom for my wife's use. (I sometimes fall asleep while she's still watching) Got everything all hooked up, but no matter how or where I positioned the transmitter or receiver, I got so much hissing noise that it was very difficult to understand the programs. Am returning the RS120, have used similar units before with minimal problems."
RII1YIGP8B618,4,"Excellent sound. I use these when working in my basement. I am either watching something streaming on the man cave tv, or just listening to music while I solder or tinker. Without them, as soon as the heat or A/C turned on, I could not hear without cranking up the volume. Then I'd have to turn it down again. The only downside is that the headband is slippery, so when I bend over, they fall off. I will put some grabbier material over the headband"
R24JODBL6FF3YE,5,use it most every day/night  --  and the wife loves the fact the TV volumn is sound can be normal for her.....
R2Y3URW0OOEWRX,5,I bought two of these units and set one each on different TV's.  This allows me to use any of these or both of these on any TV.  I don't even have to change the channel mode on headphone.  These are great.  I would recommend to anyone.
R20T3UOW3SVWVD,4,work great but if you bend over they will slip off
R3J1QHAEQZTAUO,5,"Amazing quality and design, really ergonomic and the wireles transmitter is as clean and sharp as if it where wired"
R3R61OYA41OT5Z,3,The only gripe I have is that I thought they were Bluetooth compatible but you have to physically plug the device into a receiver and then it uses a radio signal to transmit it to your wireless headphones.
R186TUWQE2HR4F,2,"Disappointed the covering is cloth and not leather! That is not healthy, or sanitary. Would like to return. Leather is healthier."
R28PIGUEA6C868,1,Stopped working within a month.
R15ETWIFHTDHY3,5,Worth the price. Set up was easy. Have used almost nightly.
R2HG43U9L9MD39,2,Could not hear as well as expected.
RQ28XE98AO9J,5,"great product,good sound,good charging stand"
R116U1OU2D7I2U,5,"These were purchased for my dad who is hard of hearing. They are wonderful. The best feature is that you can walk away from the television (I went outside on the opposite side of the house and was still able to hear clearly) and still hear whatever you are watching. My dad loves them. We caught these on sale just in time for Christmas, so they were a great value as well."
R39IPKIA7FXPFI,1,"Way too slippery....Constantly falls off head. If I look up, off it goes. if I look down, i have to let go what ever i'm doing and grab for it. If sitting &amp; looking straight forward, all is ok. But, i bought this mostly to move around and do things. Not happy about this. My head size is not small. I have been using JVC now for 30 or so years with out this being any problem. Also: It will blast you with loud noise if the sound source is paused for a few second. Not good at all. No one wants a shock &amp; surprise like that."
R3CJ3N08UYLL15,1,"Revised after using for 2 months from 2 stars to 1 star. Because the level of hiss and difficulty of tuning is just F@#%-ing annoying. Complete waste of money. I wish I had gotten a digital set.  There is too much hiss with these headphones. I regret not purchasing headphones which are digital instead of these which are analog. I bought these because these have an on-ear design which I strongly prefer to the over-ear design of most digital wireless headphones.  The problem is not interference from other equipment. I tried each of the 3 channels available and the problem is the analog technology.  I would also note that there is a tuning dial, which you use to tune in one of the 3 channels just like an old radio dial. This tuning dial is right next to the volume dial which makes it easy to mix up and accidentally adjust the tuning reception instead of the volume.  Overall, I am disappointed with this Sennheiser product."
R16DPSL2QA1MC,4,"The unit was exactly what I expected, and it was delivered promptly; thank you."
RY6OVH9OM1HKH,3,Its kind of bulky and the cords to plug it in are super long.  I dont like that you have to look for the sound and if it gets to far away or you move a bit there is static that can hurt your ears if its turned up a bit.
R2OE5UR8BE921A,5,Great value!
R3KVSFIW1PCEZ4,5,works great after initially adjusting tuning frequency
R3AT3PSMW478SU,5,Husband has been wearing these for 5 years so the tv doesn't have to be so loud.  I purchased these for myself because there is so much background noise in the shows and movies it is hard to understand what the people are saying.  We have the two headpieces hooked to the one receiver.  these are the best headsets for this purpose as my husband has tried quite a few.
R2M47NXW5FZ85I,4,"Headphones are quite comfortable and are a large improvement over a TV's built in speakers.<br /><br />Wireless range allows moving between rooms and still maintaining clear sound.<br /><br />There is a small amount of crackling and other interference that can be heard occasionally, mostly if the volume is low. On the whole not an issue during usage."
R377A5F642RZV8,5,"Worked exactly as I hoped.  Bought them for my wife, but I use them too."
R20NCU6B44Z8LU,5,"Excellent, works great. I highly recommend this product."
R2CA10UK2O4ZZA,2,After using headset for 90 mins the volume drops to nothing and you have to turn the volume to max to hear anything. Happens every time. Installing new batteries does not help. Buyer beware!
R2ZVSL7OOB4GEU,3,"The headphones work well enough. The tuning seems overly sensitive and will produce unwanted screeches in your ear as you walk around the house. The headphones slide off your head if you bend over and my previous headphones (Sony) were activated by putting them on, much easier than turning them on/off.  Overall a good value for the money paid."
R2MHXTSRAG5GOZ,5,"We relocated to another state and had to stay in an apartment temporarily. So, to drown out the upstairs kids having a slam dance party every day, we got these. They work great, very little static.<br /><br />I do not have a tiny head and these fit nicely. If you have a big head, you'll understand why I said that :)"
RP8XBX2GHTWJM,2,Like everything about this item except the FIT.  The head phones are way to big for me.  I can't look down when I have them on without them slipping off. 
R3QJWMD6QZC5IU,3,"I purchased this about 2 years ago. It was easy to set up and the sound quality was good. I did have issues with static and interference mentioned by other reviewers but it was not too intrusive. However, I tried to use them this week and one side of the headphones was dead. Now I haven't used these much (99% of the time, they rest on the stand) so these are not used up electronics.<br /><br />The last set of Sennheiser headphones I purchase worked for more than 15 years. For my current set to fail so soon is very disappointing. I'm going to have to think long and hard about buying Sennheiser headphones again."
R3O7Y4K8SEU5QK,5,Excellent-5 stars
RD6PKBFNCYEIV,2,"I wish these headphones were more comfortable, as they are otherwise great for my needs.  I wanted an inexpensive pair of headphones for watching TV when my wife slept.  These offer good sound for the money, decent battery life, easy charging, and good range.  My only issue is the fit--they don't cup your ear securely, sitting flat across your ears.  This, along with weak clamping pressure, makes them very insecure on my head.  They're fine as long as you're sitting on the couch, but as soon as I get up and do any activity or even bend forward, they slip off.  I wish I had returned them."
R1XNI8HYD7CNCS,4,"the sound quality is very good and I like the fact that it come with a charger/storage stand. The only problem is the tension on the headset is to weak, if you move around the headset falls off your head."
R1TBTT5SJ61GJ7,3,"These are ok, not great. Main issue, if you mute, signal drops after a minute or two and loud static kicks in. Bought them for the wife, she doesn't like that, took them back off the TV."
R19KTYZ1BZDUSA,5,Love them would recommend to anyone !!
REIQRG47THHPB,5,They work great and comfy too.
R17XWDKDP3Z7J9,3,"Ive owed more than one set of these, but these did not work as expected."
R1Y5P2QKAB409W,1,"WARNING! Hearing loss! This Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones when used as a TV remote listening system emitted a sudden deafening &#34;explosion type&#34; sound which has caused a major uncorrectable permanent hearing loss in one ear. The cause of the that explosive sound is unknown. While the earphone volume was set to low, the explosive sound was unbearably loud. I am reporting this to learn if similar events have happened to other users. Purchased at Amazon 14 Nov 2014"
R2OBHR2LHR1K8O,2,I think I just received a bum unit - but decided rather than go with the same unit to upgrade to the RS 180's!  Go for the upgrade you wont regret it.
R2W6UDNP6W4488,2,"I really love these headphones!  I got a Miccus Mini-jack RX: Bluetooth Music Receiver to send music to some Pyle speakers I put in my kitchen, so I'd have music in my kitchen.  Unfortunately, they don't work well, even when I've got them strung out on walls and facing each other directly across my little studio apartment.  I wrote a very unsatisfactory review of them.  Plus, if I pair them with my computer speakers, there's a severe lag between the music in my computer speakers, and the ones in my kitchen.  The Pyle speakers are pretty good, though.  I'd been checking out wireless headphone options as a work-around.  I settled on the Sennheiser RS 120 based on reviews, and the Sennheiser brand.  I've got to say, I love these headphones; they've become my new best friend.  I have a small San Francisco studio apartment, but there are separate kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.  I can go anywhere in my apartment, and the music is smooth and static-free.  I tried going down three floors to the recycling area behind the building, and they kept the quality of sound almost all the way; then started with a bit of static.  But I was still receiving music.  The sound quality is very good.  Bass is there, and the quality of the sound is smooth and silky.  I can wear them for a long time and don't get music or headphone fatigue.  I'll wear them to bed and listen to soothing music 'till I fall asleep.  Two things I had to learn: I thought the ear cups themselves needed to be close to the transmitter to charge the battery.  I was fiddling with it 'till I got it just right, and the charging light came on.  But, actually (my son had to point this out) there are two metal strips in the headphone band.  The charging happens when these strips come in contact with the bracket that the headphones hang on.  Another thing: in the right headphone, there's a dial for volume, and a dial for reception.  Sometimes when I first start it up, the reception needs to be adjusted.  All I'll get is scratchy, static interference tones.  So I'll dial in the reception wheel 'till I get proper reception.  BUT- I started getting little static tones behind the music.  No amount of fiddling with the static dial would help.  I went onto the Sennheiser website, and found out that there's a tiny, barely visible white switch at the front-center base of the transmitter.  This switch has three different settings.  I switched the setting, and re-dialed the earcup reception dial, and the little bit of static went away.  Also- there's a little on/off switch on the left earcup.  I'm giving all this information here, because the enclosed instructions really aren't up to the task.  So, I've only had 'em for a few days, but I put these on first thing in the morning, and first thing when I get home from work.  They work great for me, and I love 'em.  Great sound, lightweight, comfortable, and excellent reception.  I'm really, really glad I bought these headphones, and I've been showing them to other people. UPDATE - 6-30-2017-  TERRIBLE CHARGING SYSTEM; EAR-BUSTING NOISE IF THE SOUND SOURCE QUITS.  I'm not really using these too much anymore.  Reason one is: the charging dock.  There are a couple of narrow metal strips in the headphone band; they need to contact the charging dock exactly right, or the headphones don't charge.  I literally just spent 5 minutes trying to fit and fiddle with these headphones so that they engaged the charging dock right.  Just because I've finally got the precise placement arranged now doesn't mean they'll stay in place and charge.  Too many times I've gone to use them, and the charge was low and they quit on me.  I don't need the frustration of endlessly fiddling with these things just to charge 'em. The second reason I don't use them much anymore: As long as the music is playing, they sound good.  As soon as the music is over and the source quits broadcasting, a huge roar of static immediately assaults my ears, and I have to tear the headphones off myhead before my hearing gets damaged.  Why use a product that's painful to my eardrums?   Unfortunately, these two defects make these headphones NOT a good buy.  If they charged well and didn't assault my ears with a painful roar of static, I'd recommend them.  Why buy a product that hurts me and won't charge?"
RX4HPPIWVI5Q9,1,Did not liked it at all
RICKC7PW2CNFI,1,"Does not work properly, I have to frequently adjust the tune as it goes off. Also they came without papers in the box so I was unable to send them back. Very disappointed! This is the first time I have had a problem with something I bought from Amazon"
R28ZBWJ3UNNSUX,5,Excellent sound.
R1PH9B8AOB2WB7,5,"Comfortable and has good tone and ample volume..  Ample battery life.  Quick recharge. Overall, better than my old Sony headphones."
RXT27DWLLHOZT,5,I am very pleased with the performance of these little headphones.They are all they are represented to be.
R1IJ5G3FGXQK10,4,Function well. what else is there to saY.
R1MWKH5NXWP7D6,5,"Oh my, my, my, do I love these!!  We live in a small house and with these my husband can come home from work and watch his sports shows while my son does homework.  They work great and were extremely easy to set up."
R1Q0YI3GKLNH6E,5,Bought this based on the other amazon reviews.  Does everything advertised but had a pleasant surprise.  The sound quality is great.  It sounds like speakers and not necessarily canned headphones.
RT66P9TFCZBAN,5,"Very easy to use, sound is clear and the price was reasonable."
R2Q4NPDH0TXJ9P,5,Great wireless sound! I listen to TV & Internet without disturbing others. Great frequency response! Now own two sets.
R333BB8Q32PHWV,4,"This solved my problem of watching TV while my wife is reading. Worked out of the box. Better sound quality than my fairly new flat screen TV. The charging stand is very convenient. While I rarely watch for more than two or three hours at a time, the batteries in the headphones have never failed. I have been very satisfied and recommend this item without reservation."
R2Q6MFGJRUVRP7,2,Received this product today was faulty did not work please give me a phone number to call
RTJO1ERUDQZLA,5,"Better than expected.  Threw out the old pair, bought another pair of these for another room.  Very pleased with purchase."
R24UX9ZWRPEJX6,5,"I had the older model of these.  The adapter finally quite working after about 5 years so I bought this one and now I have two sets of ear phone that work fine with the new transmitter.  They recharge (with rechargeable batteries-included) right on the unit.  The sound is great and can be use for music or TV or the computer.  A good deal, especially if you are a bit hard of hearing."
R2S4XNZK2N5OK,5,They work great for my mother.  She's very happy with them and now her and my father can watch tv together again!
RE9FGL8CTYLXN,5,works great! easy to set up
RP2FT647UJSRK,1,I purchased this item in November 2013.  I tested it and then packed it up and put it on a shelf until I needed it.  I have never used it and decided to sell it.  I took it down and plugged it in to check it out and the power light will not come on.  There is no power.  I tried everything.  This is a piece of junk.  Never used just sat on a shelf for over a year and won't work. What a waste of over 100.00
R2VQ5H6G24AZX2,4,ok
RMWVHL2GOEW3W,1,"I have bought several RS-120 units in the past. They normally last about 2 years before the volume and frequency pots start going out, but this one I bought in July and it has already having issues.<br /><br />I am upset because I purchased the Amazon supported warranty and they told me to use the manufacturer's warranty. Sennheiser will not answer calls or return calls. It is impossible to fill out a warranty claim on their web site.<br /><br />After this period of time Amazon doesn't have a provision to return the unit.<br /><br />Guess I am stuck with a bad unit"
R2WSBWJY7HMRZ3,1,The RS120 stopped working after 4 months and they will not accept a return/replacement. The base unit is defective as the headphones work with our older TR140 base.  Don't waste your time with these. I have been a big fan of Sennheiser for 50 years buying the HD414 phones back in the early 70s and will no longer buy anything else from them.
R1U27O9M8NSW07,5,"If you want quick delivery, great quality at a great and reasonable price this vendor delivers all that one could hope for. and the sound is perfect while at the same time if you don't want no one else to hear it late at night then so be it.  These are great.  Try them, you wont be disappointed."
R3Q2HO3OE4X49H,1,Delivered without a packing slip so I can't return it; No means of contact are given...no phone or address; the directions are a translation from German and almost make sense in English; the unit absolutely will not stay powered so the rechargeable batteries won't charge.  A beautiful $80 paperweight.
R3P5BW43KYA91P,2,was not clear
R1G8V8TNZ009Y1,3,"The headphones work fine, however, one size doesn't fit all. The headphones do not fit snugly on my head. If I'm sitting still they are ok. If I try to move around, they slip off my head."
R2Q1G2KSQ7SFWI,5,"I've tried alot of these hearing devices, but I have to admit, this really works and they are a very nice quality set. Also very comfortable, not something I would say about others I've tried. Thanks!!!"
R3SE4F6KFCYW3N,5,"I rarely review orders but I had to for this!! This is one of the best items I have ever purchased!  It was simple to install and is the best thing for my relationship. My partner sleeps odd hours and this lets me watch whatever I want whenever I want without worrying about waking him up.<br />The stereo sound is phenomenal and completely contained within the comfortable headphones.<br />I highly, highly recommend these headphones!!"
R1SN0SWDW09QJF,5,Very pleased. Longer range and much better tuning stability than my previous wireless headphones. Good sound quality.
RHZCVMP8ELCY,5,Earphones are very lightweight compared to others I have used.  Sound is excellent
R3H7E6VKQSWL6Z,2,These headphones are not very good. They have limited range and the headphones themselves do not fit very snugly no matter how I try to adjust them with the limited adjustment capability. I am very disappointed with these headphones especially for what they cost.
R3PEVL1ICKRIAF,5,Just as promised..just as describe...
R2NNH0OBMMWPOJ,5,"I bought these for my husband (who claims he's not hard of hearing). Our house is not large & he usually has the t.v. blasting almost all day long. I like peace & quiet. This has been a source of annoyance to both of us. I have also bought him headphones before which he didn't like & wouldn't wear.<br />This wireless headphone set is awesome! He can hear great on these headphones, even better than just listening to the t.v. (where sometimes he'll say \\""what did he say?\\"") He can even walk out on the patio and still hear his ballgame. I am able to think & do my thing without that blasting t.v.. PEACE AT LAST! They are worth their weight in gold. Comfortable, easy to use. Why did I wait so long?"
R1OH3I01VG773I,3,"Some signal issues,"
R3LAY15DFRYU5C,4,"Mostly great results with these headphones especially when compared to the cheap Sony units available.  The sound quality is very good and the range is excellent.  There are a few caveats, however:  since they are &#34;on the ear&#34; they tend to fall off if one isn't careful while bending over.  The other - and this is just lousy designing - is the &#34;tuning&#34; wheel is right next to the &#34;volume&#34; wheel.  It is far too easy to mistake the tuning for the volume and in fact you often accidentally brush it and suddenly the things don't work.  Sennheiser should have made the &#34;tuning&#34; a different type of rotating control, perhaps on the opposite earpiece, and made it so you had to deliberately make the change.  This is just lousy design work.  Also, I can tell the &#34;on-off&#34; switch will fail in a short time;  it doesn't inspire confidence.  But, they also don't cost $200 either.  Considering the number of people with hearing loss around the world, one would think there would be literally dozens of options for this type of thing, but - alas - no."
R2AU8PVWABLDCE,2,Was defective when received and I immediately returned it.
R3GPOQZFNPYCBR,4,"The unit was in fine shape, but the reception does not seem to be quite as good as my other set."
R8QF9IQ9CG488,5,My husband wears the headset and it actually saves my ears.  I will order another set for our cabin.
RVZ6D3BEYJ4KC,5,I can honestly say that this produce is the best i have used.
RJWPGOVXP87RI,4,"These fulfilled all my expectations as far as freedom of movement, extent of range, comfort on the head and quality of sound. The only quibble I have is that the re-charging station is a bit finicky.  If the headphones are not on it EXACTLY so, they won't recharge.  It's an easy thing to remedy however, but it does keep me from giving the unit five stars."
R18NHT4AKP3JZL,4,Clear concise sound.
R3PZ62PDVVXBE0,3,i had Sony headphones they fit me better and sound was easier to keep tuned  The new set is hard to keep tuned doesn't have the range of the sonys I'll probably return these and find some Sonys  I thought the Sennheiser brand would be far superior but they wernt for me
R6OM2C0NL3UTX,4,"These are actually pretty great - within their limitations. After you figure out what frequency setting you need to have it at, and then fine tune that frequency on the headset, 98% of the hiss and noise goes away (this is a note regarding other users who had issues). There is a bit of an issue with extreme low frequencies, but outside of that, all is good. These really are the perfect late night or cleaning the house headphones. You can do you thing and move around, while sort of watching something on t.v. or streaming tunes."
R1LUFZZ2BTTM3V,4,These headphones  have the best range of any I have purchased in the  past. The higher you place the transmitter the better the range. I have mine in the basement and it's still good range. You will hear white noise with these but I find that when I use low volume at the headphones and higher volume on my audio source I can tolerate it and enjoy the music.
R3T8CCMK3IXCCL,5,This is an excellent product.  I bought it to see if some of those lines I miss because some actors love to mumble a lot would be clearer. It worked. No outside noises interfere with your being totally incolv d in the program. Sound quality is superb.
R3RJCJCZVNSE8H,5,"I purchased these on a whim during a Cyber Monday sale.  I keep these in my bedroom hooked in to my little 32' LCD TV.  Sound is crisp and I haven't had any of the interference issues that many complain about.  I don't have cable in my bedroom but I do have the TV hooked into a Roku with Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Pandora along side an Xbox 360.  The games sound about the same way I'd expect them to sound if I weren't using headphones.<br /><br />Living in an apartment and being a gamer I kinda needed I way I could catch up on my old back catalog of 360 games while being able to play them as loud as I wanted (My Xbox One and PS4 are in my living room so those will eventually be hooked into some Astro's when I get around to it."
R36XU0QJAJNOFB,5,"Plug them into TV, PC, even Piano. Clear sound."
R1IJHX9PKY0J4T,4,"I purchased these headphones in December of 2013 and absolutely loved them.  The sound was quite adequate for bedroom listening. The battery life was great if one turns them off after use, and if not just place them in the cradle and your good to go the next day.  I had no issues with comfort, they fit OK and did not fall off.  Unfortunately, it is now May of 2015 and they have quit working.  The two lights on the cradle light up, all cables are properly connected, they just don't work any longer.  To attempt a repair is ridiculous - it would cost more than the original price.  UPDATE:  DUH! I just realized that it may simply be a change of rechargeable batteries. I will update if it works!"
R2V8X3BKMQ7MFA,4,Good Vibrations.
R27K9Y91EXO709,1,Worked great for the first month but now it won't work at all. So disappointed!!
R66H16CXTD1RD,5,This is the second pair I have purchased but the first that I got from Amazon.  The reception is fantastic and the range is perfect.  And I saved considerably more than I did when I bought my original pair from RadioShack.  These are great for people that have to keep turning the volume up on the TV to understand what's being said.  They also allow me to watch TV and not bother my wife while she's sleeping.  I highly recommend.
R20FGLBZB3E4T6,3,"after only 6 weeks, unit automatically turns off when in use. can't return as only get 30 days to return. will try to contact the seller directly.  Update: sent directly to manufacturer. received refurbished headphones today. so far so good."
R139C2ZB2LUBNJ,5,Great tone and convenient.
R3U5EHNPIRZORS,3,it is what it is
RBH2INZOE6LXD,5,I bought this item knowing how good it was and it met all my expectations.  Great sound and range.
R1EI9YOR53F3YC,5,"The wireless headphones work great, it is very convenient.<br />Something that might trouble people is the tuning function for the headphones, it has different frequency and a tuning wheel for the headphones. You can find what frequency and tune the headphone to work best for you. Sometimes other wireless appliances such as routers and phones might cause some noise (interference).<br />The battery life is great for me, I don't really use the headphones past 3 or 4 hrs.<br />The quality is very good, probably better then my cheap speakers. There is decent bass and the sound is very rich. Since the headphone is open back, the audio you listen to will bleed through meaning people around you can hear what you hear if the audio is loud enough.<br />Compare to my old wired headset, it is a +1 because it is wireless. I always hated the tangled up wires everywhere."
RV3NQFY2JHSVN,2,"I have owned and used these headphones for about 5 years.  My &#34;man cave&#34; is a room off of our bedroom.  For many years my late night TV watching kept my wife from getting a proper nights sleep.  I purchased these headphones after reading others positive reviews.  Unfortunately I have decided that I can no longer use these headphones.  The pros are as follows: 1.  The sound quality is excellent. 2.  Charging the batteries overnight gives a full 20 hours of use. 3.  If you forget to place the headphones on the charger, you can put in regular AA batteries. 4.  After five years of use the headphones show no signs of use. 5.  The reach of the headphones is excellent.  I can go downstairs and do the dishes, cook, or out to the mailbox without loosing reception.  The cons: 1.  The ear cups and strap padding are foam.  If you sweat, the foam stinks.  This is overcome by spraying the foam with a disinfectant - daily. 2.  The headphones are big.  I have big ears and an average sized head.  The headphones extend above and below my ears.  The adjustment is set as small as possible.  These headphones must be for people with really big heads. 3.  Their is no &#34;spring&#34; to the headphone strap that goes over your head.  The headphones hang off of the top of your head. 4.  Items 2 and 3 make long term use of headphones annoying.  I don't like the fact that the headphones are so heavy and set above my ears and on my neck.  In other words, the headphones are not comfortable."
R2ZVL3UVQY35KQ,5,Works great very nice great sound
R2T2NKF70FQTS4,5,It works good even when the kids are hollering.
R1OHWLV61DLCU6,4,"These are great! My husband sometimes has to work late, and his desk is right next to the television. This allows for both of us to be happy on those nights! It works well. The volume control on the side of it is convenient! And I can walk around and do the dishes or grab something without missing what's being said on the t.v. Though that ability depends on how far away I am from the base. Additionally, it's very easy to switch between the regular television speakers and the headphones.  My only complaint is that the headphones start to hurt my head about an hour into using them. That might be the case for any kind of headphone though, I'm not sure.  Overall, useful product for a good price!"
R59J2WT43G0IH,3,"It is a super nice fit for a full size headset and the sound is good once you get tuned in.  Read all of the specifications this is not blue tooth compatiable and will not work with ipad, iphone, droid etc...  I would buy for an adult or a serious gamer , good gift for the price."
R19RA6U00V0GDK,5,"Easy setup and great sound. A little finicky on the static, but once tuned they are perfect! Don't believe the negative crybabies that are expecting these to drive their car for them. These work as expected!"
R3EX9YBDBNGCDI,4,"This is a great item.  I am having some problem understanding some dialog in some movies, especially when the whisper or garble their words.  But, with this item I understand everything.  One problem, it keeps sliding off my head, otherwise would have given it a five star."
R2EARZDIJQDLJF,5,"These things are absolutely great.  My mother-in-law is now residing with us and likes to watch TV until 1 or 2 am.  The noise was driving me crazy.  I bought these things for her and told her no more speakers after 11 pm.  She wears them, seems to enjoy them, and I once again have peace in the house.  The sound quality is quite good and they are very easy to hook up.  I haven't tested the range, but I have seen my MIL cooking in the kitchen while continuing to listen to her favorite shows."
R3KLX9XGS28PZ3,4,"Awesome purchase.<br />Comfortable, good quality & great battery life.<br />However, when you are playing loud music the people around you will easily hear too."
R1J81BYXQDWK69,5,They work very well.  Extremely high fidelity.  Used first of the three possible channels (frequencies) and it was fine.  Didn't test for range but works great up to 20'.  Base with two support rods are attractive and also provide contacts for charging headset.  Headset has on/off switch that is used every time it's needed which is normal.  Base unit turns off after 5 min or so automatically after tv is turned off.  Can see why these were rated very high.
R90EJXAN2AC9J,5,I'm losing my hearing and needed help to hear the TV. Perfect solution.
R1VXQVE9J7WK83,2,Although the price was reasonable there still remained the problem of hiss when using this product
R3SP1VDAKW1JIE,5,Excellent in design and performance. Delivery was on time and no hassle.
R3XWRFVBP4AS0,1,Never could get any sound through headphones.  Only static.  Poor instructions.  I tried all of the tuning potions and the full range at each position.
R3U8HV7KMJIPOC,5,Love them!!!!  We use them to watch TV/movies at night in our master bedroom without waking or disturbing the kids.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT!  Range is also impressive - walk downstairs to kitchen wearing headphones still listening to program with no static.  Battery will last days between charges.  I purchased 2 headphones and share the base/charger unit with no problems.  I also purchased a pair for my parents as a gift and they also love them especially since each one can control their own volume levels.
RYKXC4IZTC8BQ,4,Sound quality is very good.. Doesnt sit well on the head. Feels loose.
R2KE2JK3SCKX0K,5,very pleased with this item.they are very clear and i can walk outside or into any room in our house and the volume and clarity is great. i would buy this brand again.
RLPX8VKULA3UW,5,All I can say is that these headphones still work great after 7 years of almost daily use.
R2G8M6BA4WEY7R,1,"Piece of crap. Bad power wire, keeps shutting down. By the time I figured out that the problem was in the unit and not my connections, it was too late to return it (of course). So I'm out $75 + $15 for all the connectors I bought (that didn't help) =$90 + S/H. And I still have to listen to my wife watching GLEE incessantly."
RSJDFY3KTKW64,4,The RS120 works very well.  The sound is clear and the volume is adjustable.  The negatives are that the fit is a bit loose and it took a bit of trial and error to adjust the tuning to the sender to get clear reception.  The installation to my TV was very simple.
R19U0NLUGP9TI1,3,"Was contemplating between 3 & 4 stars. if there were 3.5 stars I would have given it. First, let me say that if the rating was for functionality I would have given it 5 stars. It meant my needs 100%. We are currently in a small 2-bedroom apartment and my wife retires to the bedroom early and I stay up to watch TV. These are perfect for these types of situations. My hearing is not that good, so I can hear the TV much better with these headphones on. So why only 3 stars? Well, the sound it not high quality and there's 2 knobs that have to be adjusted. One for tuning in and the other is the volume. You have to be careful that you don't blow out your ear drums when adjusting these 2 knobs. The other thing is that since they are wireless, they need a place for 2 AAA batteries, which makes them larger than most headphones that I've owned and this weight means that it needs to be tight on your head. For me they don't squeeze closely to my ears and will fall off if I move my head around. But, let me finish with the good part, I use these almost everyday and wouldn't be without them. I don't think there are any similar products out there that address some of the problems I've encountered for the same price, so for me these headphones are a best buy."
R2CTL21GMBRPRD,2,Sent back. Too much of a hassle to use these.
R1EL9MW36570RS,5,"My wife uses them nearly every day, so that she can watch TV without driving me crazy. (I can't stand the sound of the TV if I'm not watching it.) They work well and they've held up well. Caution: the batteries will run down if you ever forget to turn off the headphones when not using them."
R23LID8SM8E6N4,2,"Save your money. This unit is no better than a cheap $35 unit at Radio Shack. Would not recommend to others. Uncomfortable on my ears. Intermittent static, enough to ruin the experience. I used it for a TV."
R36PWW7Q3303FE,5,Saved my marriage. I can now take my online classes at home without hearing a movie blasting in my ear.
R2ZXFYUX4PKMIT,5,none
R3P4PTNK9D8AN0,5,My husband really likes using these and I love it when he does :)
R1Z9MW42MX3CZV,5,"This is my second Sennheiser Headphones product.  The clarity of sound, production of stereo separation, and great range make this an outstanding bargain.  Works perfectly."
R2CR1I6M7XPCHX,5,good quality sound.
R2LKAMCGS5N6IX,5,"Way cool, Now my husband can sleep when I'm watching TV late at night.<br />One problem - if there's another TV working in the house, these earphones<br />are so good that they may pick up both programs"
R3Q9ELBTOSIW9X,3,does not work well with my tv.May have to buy a better tv.
R3MPGEQFZ606DJ,5,Works as described. Very good sound quality and no background noise as some described.
R3OXQP0HYW5C50,5,Great product. Easy setup. Great sound.  Fast service from the seller.
R3NLG5RXSI2VD4,4,"This is my second Sennheiser RS120 in 6 years. The battery charging part of my first headset (contacts) stopped working after a couple of years. But the headset itself still works well otherwise  I was charging the battery outside the unit. Recently I bought a second one for my wife. We are now using one base unit/charging cradle as the transmitter for the two headsets.<br />The sound quality and range is very good. There is no hissing or static sound (I know this for sure because I have used other brands like JVC)  The charging cradle is really good, Overall an excellent product (minus the batter charging part for me)"
R2DB8YZPMLCKAS,3,Had trouble with the light and trying to dial it in. Great sound though.
R1THX0ZM24MQVS,1,So very disappointed!  It does not work with Plasma Televisions and nowhere did I read that when I ordered it.
R34A5XAHUHU4Z,3,Could not get it to work like it should.
R1XBG9QV3JURJN,4,It stopped the arguments over whose TV was too loud between  my wife and me.
RRFPM7454X9LQ,5,These were recommended by a friend for a night owl TV watcher. It works great!  It keeps the peace AND was easy to install.
R3ME0Y44OQK63A,5,"Not the top of the line, but they work great for the price point. Use these at night when others are sleeping."
R19BCOHP7SXW4X,5,Why did I wait? Should have made this purchase years ago.
R2PLQBQ668OLGZ,5,"Excellent sound, user friendly, very good value."
R1PBQ76OPR26FI,2,"Kept cutting out and losing connection even though It was only 10 ft away, ended up returning"
RMI7KNXZNFJHJ,5,Better sound than the TV. Hookup simple and took no adjusting (tuning).
R2MQDDD06N75GB,5,Works flawlessly. Sound is better than expected for the price.
RWAWXE9VD9JUS,4,clarity is unmatched although I wish that it was a little bit more comfortable the ear pads are really cheap foam and the charger works very well too
RQMY78K40MGKB,3,Electronically works fine as advertised.  My complaint is the headset itself doesn't seem to ergonomically fit my head very well.  Headset tends to slip off head when standing or moving around.  I have a more expensive Sennheiser headphone and have never had this problem with them.
R3IILYW97ZI9RY,2,does not work well
R1YY3T5L8DM8JA,2,Ok I guess if your head is the size of a pumpkin.
R3QHPBIXK73R0Z,5,I am well pleased with the headphones. They allow me to watch TV when I have insomnia( which is frequently) and I don't disturb anyone. The TV sound can be muted and I still hear it well. That is a huge plus for hearing impaired. Than you so much. I need another one for the bedroom now.
R1EO4RCHGYV8RC,5,GREAT PRODUCT
R738Q8UMY6YXU,5,"Great headphones. Highly recommend for quality, comfort and value."
R3I1OPB64A290W,5,These are great and very easy to set up! No static at all...
R2EQGEKSVGSSXF,5,This is the 3rd set I have owned. 1st one the base finally malfunctioned after over 10 years. The 2nd one I had given to my Mom. She was very hard of hearing and this allowed her to watch her favorite TV shows and fully enjoy the audio. When she made her transition I &#34;inherited&#34; it. The last one I just wanted to use in another room with a different set up. I now have 3 head sets with 2 base units. They all function as promised.
R9LLMR6240LDO,4,"I've tried others. August. Sony. The .Sonys, to be fair, were cheap, wired. But they were good. Just not wireless. A significant reason for a positive review from me this product is, the receiver for the headphones are two, I believe rca cables, which go in to the headphone jack on the computer. They are not bluetooth. the August headphones I used played havoc with the other bluetooth peripherals paired with the computer.  Not sure how the signal is transmitted from the headphone unit, which includes a charging stand, to the headphones. The signal is clear. Not as clear as the wired version of Sennheiser headphones, but very good. One small source of annoyance is that, after non use of maybe three or four minutes, a loud hiss erupts from no signal. Turning off the headphones stops the hiss, but annoying. Lastly, the headphones require tuning to find the frequency the computer is broadcasting on. This is easily achieved by manipulating the tuning dial built in to the headphone unit."
R3J7T9LNBHGEVQ,4,"They are very good,but they fall off if you bend over"
RN4L2OL2N1BVJ,4,"Excellent quality, comfortable, good value"
R3JSYCG3OUGGW,5,Good product but could be a bit tighter around the ears.
R1HYWGR6LBJ5F5,5,Very pleased with this product. After simple setup it works great!
R3UR5ORNMR9ORJ,5,Great!
R2YQG4QD0LB6SL,5,Purchased this for our mother who now in the nursing home. She was having problems of hearing her TV so ordered this. It has totally helped her and we are so pleased with them that we are thinking of getting ones to have in our home.
R1WGDH9Q5HIBQR,5,Excellent
RPQDFA50HD5RH,1,They stopped working after 6 months.  So disappointed!
RYN3GAHQG8Z2,5,Absolutely couldn't live without these.  I've even bought these as gifts.  Incredible high quality product.
RNPU6NWK6JCSB,2,I cannot adjust headset to TV.  All I get is static. Can't seem to find any help on line.  Any suggestions?
R3I9WDSNAXV0DU,5,"It's the best investment we've made!!!  LOL.  He can watch what he wants at any volume and I can be in the same room (or 1 room away) and not be bothered - it's seriously amazing!!  (also, if we watch the same thing, you can have one person using these at their desired volume, and the TV volume also on - ie: lower volume on TV and higher volume for person with headphones on - which is also a nice feature)"
R3NEX4SMR8XWG,1,poor sound quality.  No backround noise suppression.
R1LN187SRM202V,1,"I'm extremely disappointed in these headphones. I was expecting something really reliable, and they aren't.  The phones themselves are fine, with nice bass response and good overall sound. The problem is with the wireless system. They keep cutting out, and suddenly you find yourself with an awful, deafening WHITE NOISE IN YOUR EARS.  It's something to do with the automatic signal cut off, obviously, which is designed so that the batteries don't die when you put the phones down and not on the charging cradle. But there seems to be issues so that it doesn't properly pick up the audio signal, so that you find yourself watching a video and you either hear nothing, or it'll suddenly cut out.  There should at least be the option to turn this function off, but there isn't. And consequently, these headphones are pretty much useless to me.  I don't want to be deafened every few minutes, thanks."
R2Q3NVCRYP5M3G,5,These are great for the price. This is our 2nd pair. I would recommend these to anyone.
R1K0KQE8602SOC,1,"Oh my god, who designed this thing?!? I needed to replace the cheapo wireless headphones I used to watch TV with while my kids are alseep/doing homework/not in the mood to listen to Downton Abbey and I relied on Sennheiser reputation when buying these headphones. Not only is the sound quality unacceptable but the absolute worst part is that if the headphones don't get a signal for a certain amount of time (3 minutes maybe?) the base turns off automatically and your ears are assaulted by the most awful screeching sound. So, for example, if you're in the kitchen cooking dinner with the headphones on and the show ends, or your song ends...you have to whip those puppies off your ears pronto or else you will be scared sh***less when the buzzing/shrieking begins. So, just be sure to never have your hands full when the music stops."
RSDZR420289KC,4,Easy to set up. Sound is very good quality.  I haven't really tested the range as I only use to watch tv in bed and not disturb my wife.  Overall what I expected to get out of these headphones for the price
R3J3YRDI541CD5,4,"PROS: Work great for hearing TV over top of my parrots (all 8) and wife watching tv in next room (think she's deaf LOL) or playing game console w/out annoying the wife. I also like the fact that the rechargable batteries are replaceable instead of built in and WILL go bad eventually...just pop in two new NIMH and good as new. Good sound quality and volume.<br />CONS : Even at smallest setting they tend to want to fall off my head if I lean over (& I don't have a small skull) so I have to remember to pull the head band back onto my neck if I get up to do anything that involves looking down (vacuuming - yes, some men can do that, getting a beer from 'fridge, peeing - after beer LOL, etc).<br /><br />I have not checked the range on these but haven't found a reason to watch TV more than 10 feet from it. This would also make a good set of 'phones to listen to stereo with but again I haven't tested that yet. Amazon sells a low cost Optical to RCA converter if you don't have RCA outputs - which I needed to connect my TV (some newer HDMI TV's don't have RCA output, just FYI.<br /><br />All said - I would recommend these to anyone needing wireless headphones for TV or stereo music listening. Light weight, good sound, and w/charging dock a breeze to keep charged & ready to go. Would give 5 stars but the loose fit on my head makes it a 4.5"
R2ZSG22Z33BKSG,5,works great
R2DAWR1UKPCIHI,4,Love em thus far
R2548CABGSNZWY,5,Excellent wireless Headphones. I love these and when not using them they are charging up. They are very comfortable and sound great. I will probably buy more for my other TV's and PC.
R10HDUXI9IEZIM,5,"Excellent quality, clear sound!"
R13K5NESR168Y1,2,"Headphones very uncomfortable, they are always loose and fall off every time I move my head. The charging band inside the headphones has to stay in  alignment with the charging base making adjustments difficult. Also,  after 4 months they just quit working."
R1T2T933YH27RG,5,Nice and comfortable
R2BIB10DDMT7LQ,4,I like the distance I can go while listening.  After approx 3 weeks I am having some trouble adjusting the volume.  It is to expensive to have that kind of trouble in my opinion.  Makes me wonder how long it will last.  If I bend over it will fall off my head.  It has clear sound and that is good for me since I have some hearing problem.
R3AGHNGGJYTZKQ,5,"The headphones work great. I have a little trouble hearing the TV, and having to turn up the volume. With the headphones I can hear the TV without disturbing anyone else or my wife. I have two set of the headphones and I love the way they are working. I would recommend the headphones to anyone that is a little hard of hearing or just does not want to disturb anyone."
RQOSB8QRD0FA7,5,"We CANNOT do without these headphones!  First of all, it takes no time to set them up.  The fact that they recharge while on the stand is a must.  My husbands' hearing is declining and the rest of us were beginning to go crazy with the TV blaring all the time - not to mention someone might be trying to study or sleep!  We got these for him for Christmas and it's made life so much better not only for him, but for ALL OF US!!!!!  I use them often if I want to watch TV late at night and don't want to wake anyone up.  They're comfortable and adjustable.  And they're great if someone in the room would like to read/surf the computer but not watch TV.  If they ever break or stop working, I'll be ordering another one IMMEDIATELY."
R3RS5V8VW4QNKD,5,This makes tv&#34; like a theatre. Great for those who have trouble hearing.
R6MIBGJB5RQLX,4,"I bought two of thses because the first one worked so well.  Can be difficult to get it tuned right if it's close to more than one tv, but not hard to adjust.  I think the sound is great."
R1QJ0ADN1RUHSP,3,"Worked well at first, but didn't last long."
RK2MG03GUTHMH,1,Doesn't work!  The green light on the receiver that plugs in the wall works for a little while then goes out which does not allow the heads phones to function.  I have changed outlets several sometimes unplugging and replugging in headphones from tv allows it to function for a while.  I have tested tv input and my electrical plugs and they work fine.  What a ripoff.
RDV8USBMS0TWI,4,Gives me restful nights sleep since I bought these for my wife.
RTXAUQMN0MLI,5,Perfect.<br /><br />Loss of hearing make it so that I choose to listen to the TV a little louder than the rest of the family.  These allow me to watch TV as I work on the computer late into the night - without keeping anyone else up.  Beware though.  They now complain that I am typing to loud.  ;-)
R27ML2SAV1PS0V,5,"They work great with no problems as of yet.  The wife loves them as much as I because she can play games on her IPad and I can watch a movie without either one bothering the other.. These were a game changer in our house, we only talk when necessary.  Great product, thanks again."
R2I2DKYD5PJDQ7,5,The sound is out of this world and the headphones are very comfortable.  I will be purchasing a pair for my husband on Father's Day.
RITQ9TTBFH8FI,5,"I had tried several other similar products before this one.  None of them worked well.  In fact, two of them fell apart for seemingly no reason.  This was the best.  It does everything it the company says it will do and does it extremely well.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with the RS120 and, also, the way the order was handled by Amazon."
RXOU1U6L6RUH4,4,I really like the sound and I appreciate that they are adjustable.  A lot of headphones are just too big for me.<br />I had to dock one star for the unfortunate placement of the tuning dial.  I must be inadvertently detuning it when my head moves against the headrest of my chair.
R21DZSMW3D8X1M,5,easyily installed Works  with little touch. Graet product
RHICQIXZ8OGZ7,5,This works very well!
R1QMK420IZ7IEO,2,These were great while they lasted.  We used them about 10 times and then they quit working and make a horrible noise.  I will try to return to vendor since Amazone won't take return beyond 30 days.  Very disappointed.
R1HJXWBL0BT2KP,5,"PRIVACY...........!!!!!!!!  No More Disturbances from the Family, the Phone and the Pets. Quality Sound....."
R3SKA3Y7BXATT0,5,"Exactly what we needed for our RV bus trips, when spouse sleeps late.  I can enjoy the tv without waking them.  Headphones are wireless and I can move about with my dogs without any problems.  Great product."
R3V3RHKVRJNVD2,5,"Gift for my Son,they are great and work perfect."
R2R6WMQO5ITWL,5,Works well.
R1GAH2RWN5CXJ3,5,THANX
R23MVX9VRZLKO4,4,These were easy to connect to the TV and work great.
RD9GNKHKBM3EV,5,great clarity in sound.  Volume adjusts very easily.  Controls are easy to fuse; even for elderly that may need a boost without blowing everyone out of the room.  My Mom is 82 and loves them for clear voice and volume increases on her TV Talk shows she watches. Those  can be difficult to understand due to the varied volume of the individuals voice or their accent.  They stayed charged well too and easy to recharge just place them on the stand.
R1GK3H09GWPBWL,2,"Very difficult to tune the reception for clear audio and level of the volume, once tuned, you cannot move or you lose the audio again."
RBXAL93CXFM2V,5,Exactly what I needed for a fair price with timely delivery.
R1PVQ3EUE5NB09,4,"Bought this for my Dad to use on the TV in his bedroom.  I *thought* it was the same model that I bought him several years ago for his big screen, but turned out I remembered wrong and I had gotten him RS130 which is an over-the-ear design rather than on-the-ear.  While these sound fine, I think he prefers the over-the-ear design as being more comfortable.  So if I had it to do over, I'd most likely have spent the extra and gone for the RS160, but these are cheaper and seem to be fine for TV watching sessions of moderate duration."
R2B97W585DM8UE,5,Great assist w/quality sound.
R15BKIKOUQTC69,5,Great price and great sound.  Easy to set up and recharging works well.
R2E5OX11BCPSE,4,work just as described😀😀
R1BYWTDUNYIWRI,5,WORKS GREAT...IN FACT I BOUGHT TWO !!
RUF0N2ZYO70MQ,5,"Great! Works real good,I can understand what they are saying on  the tv.  Before they could have speaking another language. Music sounds great too. So much better than TV Ears."
ROZR4IUTPYO16,5,Awesome. Wife loves I got these.
R2CA3NKP3QX1AZ,1,"Was in love with this brand until I sent one of these as a gift to a familly member in the Middle East<br />He nothappy at all, he told he has Interrupted transmission all the time, very high level of noises<br />even at the closest distance  of 10inch he still could not get any acceptable sound.<br />Not recommended at all"
R2QI9BOK58SG5V,2,These are great headphones but only for TWO (2) years -- then they go dead....not the batteries - the charging unit.  We bought them in 2011 and they lasted 2 years.  We bought another set in 2013 and now this one is dead.  Not buying this brand again.
R3VGJDVEUFPF3U,3,"I love the recharging cradle, and the sound quality is pretty good, but it's a bit finicky to get it tuned in, and sometimes I get some random static.  The comfort is ok, not great.  The volume, tuning, and power buttons all have a cheap feel to them."
R5BZE4V94A2I4,5,It's GREAT!!
R1PPB9ISFBEW3H,4,"Performed pretty well, my system required some additional cables due to the TV's lack of output jacks, but once set up, my wife, who is hard of hearing, can watch a movie with me, hear all the dialog at her boosted sound level, and I don't get blown out of the room and feel like I just came from a basketball game. - A problem solver for me!"
R146VKP438UNEX,3,"Comfortable, sound quality decent, however they are very sensitive to interference.  Could not get clear reception on my channel in my office.  Other wireless phone people were using were fine.  Had to return them."
R187YGXR7DUDZK,5,"These work great. We use them for the TV, so we do not disturb other household members. My wife is not happy with all of my technology purchases over these years, she gives these two thumbs up, especially when I told her the price, she thought I paid twice as much for them. If you are going to use them for music and you are a purist - you can probably buy better sound quality, but plan on spending a lot more money. Nothing wrong with these, but Sennheiser does have a good rep for sound quality, and I'm sure their more expensive units are worth the money.<br />I can walk around the house room to room and do not lose sound.<br />And the docking station - works great.<br />I bought my first headphones (Pioneer) in 1969 - not my first rodeo."
RDBZM9DU98OK0,5,Pleasant surprise!  My husband is able to hear the tv or the first time in years.
RP8Q947RLICM2,4,A little difficult to set up but the sound is better than my 60&#34; plasma tv.
R3G0FBVUR3ONDI,1,"Two major problems: noisy and ill-fitting. I connected to my TV and tried every suggestion to remove the intermittent noise with no luck: ran it through an amplifier, tried all channels with re-tuning, moved as far as possible from the TV. And if you look down, it slips off your head. I returned it."
R3IY6PENQ1RS14,5,Amazing sound.  I can finally hear the TV in the middle of the night without bothering my spouse.
R23KCU74MJFCFK,4,"Very comfy and they sound great however, I have to keep adjusting the tuning knob. Wifi changes frequencies?"
R1PC06OIB52THT,4,Works but the headphones are not very secure on my head.
R2U9RHH7AHIFZL,1,Returned twice
RMVLTQ7YDJHYY,5,"What a completely necessary thing to own!  We have hardwood floors and sound is amplified from the downstairs to the upstairs.  When mom visits she needs the volume up high so she can hear.  She finally broke down and ordered these, and they have made a HUGE difference.<br /><br />I don't have to listen to General Hospital!  And really that's enough of a reason to own these.  You can mute the TV and still hear through the headphones, and set up was relatively easy. Also, they seem pretty sturdy.  I've dropped them.  She's dropped them.  The cats have knocked them off the charger, and they are still going strong.<br /><br />She's in the other room right now ... Probably watching the weather channel -- and blissfully, I can't hear a thing."
RQ7JLCUD7MBTA,5,"I bought these for my husband to be able to play his games after the babies went to bed, without waking them up. My husband says they are the best gift I have ever given him. 5 stars!"
R1CGWD5G3H9E0,3,"The headphones sometimes have static in the left ear.  It seems to signal based, but it shouldn't happen as I am using them in the same room as the base is located."
RRXXGQG8SLSAR,4,Works very well. Would be better if it fit tighter on the head and had a strap to go around the back of the head to prevent the headset from falling off when you look down or move around.
R3UDIOGD8H4IN8,5,Second pair. Enjoy being able to watch TV without bothering my wife.
R5D2N97ABIM6H,5,My husband and I can actually understand what the people on tv are saying!  I love these headphones.
R3VSXW9W9U3ACI,4,These things are great. The sound is almost studio quality and the range is so much better than IR. My only complaint is that they are heavy after a couple of hours but I can live with it.
R2F19XDUPK2NFB,5,Work flawlessly. Sound great.
R30GSOUFCGNQQ2,5,I bought these wireless headphones for my elderly father who has trouble hearing the TV. He loves them as they are comfortable and he can hear wonderfully with them on. This is the second pair of Sennheiser headphones he has owned. Good quality for an affordable price.
R3ENXD5VOY6M1P,5,"I purchased the Sennheiser headphones about eight months ago and absolutely loved them! They worked so well that my wife wanted a pair, so I ordered a second pair of headphones that connected with the base I originally bought. Both are wonderful - they are interchangeable. They are clear, have a great range, hold their charge well and are very comfortable. I can hear OK, but understanding speech is difficult. These headphones virtually eliminate that problem. I can watch TV shows and movies and understand the dialogue. Now the volume does not disturb others in the house (we usually have the volume on the TV turned down to 0). I highly recommend them, and I plan to buy another set for our other TV room downstairs."
R1DFQE6SH3AQKL,5,"working and charching perfectly, Product works as described"
R3UKSCGSJLT6I4,5,Great headphones with excellent transmission range.  Head phones don't have cupped ear pieces to securely fit over the ears  - so can slip off of your head it bending over.
R37HGQF5L9OVQT,5,"Have only had for these for a week or so.  So far they perform as well or better than I had hoped for.  My hearing is declining and these allow me to watch TV with the volume low or muted and hear just fine.  Clarity is fine for TV.  I have really no need to hear the TV while not watching it, but I have left the room while still wearing them and never lost the volume or clarity.  The volume control is on the headphone and it takes a while to &#34;break&#34; the habit of trying to adjust the sound with the remote control while using them."
R399QY56ULFBQ4,5,Excellent phones......comfortable to wear for long periods
R6467TEXFFCU1,5,Best purchase I ever made. I can watch TV without disturbing my wife. Love this product.
R37NGIWX8O1UWQ,1,ist one work a month  second one never would start. never buy there product again
R1AXJAJ3UNRRIY,2,"These headphones are a great price point for the function they serve, but they make a lot of distracting, sometimes disturbing, noises. At times the headphones will randomly emit a deafening static noise for a few seconds before restoring normal volume. At other times, a faint hissing in the background will distract an otherwise lucid audio experience.<br /><br />The headphones also make a loud static sound when you pause the tv for a certain amount of time.<br /><br />They offer an impressive range of motion, however.<br /><br />All in all I'd have to think a better deal exists somewhere..."
R385XTCJWIS4ON,5,Much greater distance from the source than was available with my 1st wireless headset. Sound quality is also better. This headset is used strictly for watching TV. I am hearing impaired and enjoy music programs. Sound quality is very good for this type of use.
R2HRMBT4JD4JKG,5,My 100 year old father can hear the tv with these wireless headphones.  Good product with great sound.
R1AG8SWTCL7VC8,5,Bought one and liked them so well bought another as a gift. Good reception. Can't think of anything wrong with them. Good price from Amazon. Delivery was quick.
R2TA28POZC72PK,2,"I only worked with one of my TV's, one recently bought."
RK4D6Y74P3TLA,5,Great sound and well made. Great headphones for movie watching while my wife sleeps
RLCCK93W60GZ2,4,"The headphones work great.  However, if you have a small head, this set is NOT for you.<br />Buying a headset without trying on, especially if you have a small head, was a mistake."
RIU7YRHVM6J17,3,"This is the 4th pair of wireless headphones I've owned for watching TV and my first Sennheiser.<br /><br />The good:  The audio quality is the best I have experienced yet.  It is significantly clearer than any other pair I have had and there is no hiss.  I like the ability to tune.  The range on these things is by far the best I have ever seen.  I wore them outside could still hear the TV while I was standing across the street.  Any other headset I have had gave-out a couple feet outside the front door.  There is zero audible hiss (I am looking at you Sony - WORST HISS EVER, ugh.)<br /><br />The not-so-good:  These headphones also fall off your head the easiest of any headset I have ever had.  The part that goes over your ears is flat and doesn't cup your ears like, for example, Sony's headset does.  This means it will fall off your head and fall onto the floor far easier and potentially break.  This actually may be a fatal flaw and it is the reason I only gave them 3 stars.  I have young kids.  I am not always going to think to take them off before saving my toddler from some new mischief and these things fall off very easily if you aren't sitting completely still.  Barely tip your head forward?  They are gonna fall off.  If you have hard wood or tile floors, they are going to break after enough of this.<br /><br />If you like to do housework while you wear these headphones like I do, these might not be for you.  I'm not even sure if washing the dishes while wearing these is doable.  If the ear padding was shaped slightly differently, this product would be so much better.  The ear padding is also that soft and fragile foam that you only see nowadays on the cheapest earbuds.  Maybe they were going for something that would make your ears less warm than the leathery plastic ear padding Sony uses, but, in my experience, the leathery plastic works way better."
R1NLCAD7WVR8SJ,5,These r great: very comfortable; outstanding quality sounh
R2GG9DVTREE9X4,1,sent them back
R2F19X6C92UDJR,4,These wireless headphones allow you to go quite a distance around the house without losing the signal.  They are confortable to wear and the battery lasts a long time.  They are great!
R2QIOTOKW4Q5VL,4,"Good for a basic wireless headset.  However, it needs a mute button and a treble/base adjustment."
R14OGKAENKRBXL,5,This is my second pair. They work well and I can walk anywhere in the house ans still get great reception. I can even go outside. The battery charge lasts a long time. I have never had them run out of power even if I use them 10 or 12 hours. I would definitely recommend this product.
R1VKCEI6BIO6P8,5,Great!!! I use it all the time
RYT7XIJUOS4IV,1,"I was having Intermittent power (red) loss to the stand, and now I lost the on and off audio green light. I have had this Wireless head phone for 5 months and have used it about 7 times. This was due to not having the TV for a few months. I enjoyed it when it worked. The time has gone by for returning it for another one. Will try calling Sennheiser and see what happens. Will report on out come."
R3REXFJOGWYSOY,4,"Replaced a high dollar Sony wireless headset after changing its over 30 dollar batteries a couple of times.This unit uses AAA rechargeable batteries.  The headset is lighter but doesn't fit all that well, often falls off when you bend your head downward.  The Sony spoiled me in that when you took it off, if turned itself off.  This one requires you turn it off manually or when the audio source is off, it reaches out for a signal and can become pretty noisy in addition to shortening the battery charge.  It is equally comfortable to wear and for my old ears, the fidelity is excellent.  Dollar and sense wise, it is very well worth the money and I highly recommend it."
R2P953IJIHCZP5,5,"My husband purchased these and we both love them.  His TV is very close to our kitchen/sink/prep area and it was a constant problem with noise in the kitchen and the volume of the TV increasing.  Whenever he is watching something and I am working in the kitchen, he wears them - or if he has a program on that I do not wish to listen to.  I have also worn them when I watch a particular program that I have trouble hearing the voices - I can increase the volume for my own listening without bothering anyone else.  They are comfortable, sound is good, batteries recharge on the base and have never had an issue with the batteries dying while using them.<br />Only issue we had - our TV has only an optical audio out - so we had to buy an adaptor to convert to digital audio out (although we were able to plug it into the back of the receiver - worked for everything except our Roku for Netflix)."
R1JCM5HK07WC7G,4,Work great. Comfortable.
RI5Q78EC1NG4O,5,No problems so far.  Shipped on time.  All is well.
R2JLQP9FBCPZJQ,3,Too much static even at a distance of 5 to 6 feet
R2J57IY116T25M,4,Nice basic headphone. Needs balance control. When moving around has tendancy to slip off. Angled ear piece are qiute comfortable.
R2HWX7MIVXRBAR,5,These are incredible- it's like your listening in 3D
R28DT5AXLOHM3W,5,allows older parent to hear the tv at her sound level and we can enjoy it at our level.  nice product.
R32LHL3OQP6MNH,1,Returned for refund
R3SWXRV8BMWFXJ,1,Could not get them to work.  Purchased a separate digital to analog converter and still would not work.  Returned to amazon.
R2C90HDAQ4AE9E,5,"I previously had a My Zone headphone system for watching tv at night, while my husband sleeps. The sound coming from this set blows the My Zone out of the water! What an awesome stereo, surround sound, with no outside interference, static, etc. also, no batteries to change!!! I was previously going thru 2 sets of AAA and 2 sets of AA batteries weekly. The slight cost difference will more than pay for itself without buying batteries. I actually thought with the rich sound that I had not muted the TV.  I read all the posted reviews before ordering this set and noticed several comments that they were disappointed that the rechargeable batteries couldn't be changed out/replaced when needed. The rechargeable batteries on the set I recieved are changeable. They are located under the earpiece, on side with the on/off button. Just unscrew earpiece and change batteries. The headphones are very comfortable, much more cushioned than my old set. I also ordered a separate set of foam covers for the ears so that I can wash and have a dry set to spare. I could go on bragging but that's enough, I'm very pleased!"
R2KZMSTF54GGY2,5,"GOOD SOUND,WELL SATISFIED."
R2Q7SH9PUTYRGO,5,"Works Geat.  Easy to install.  Simple to use.  Lights up when earphone are in the proper position for charging.  Comfortable to wear, when watching TV.  Don't need the high volume from the TV, but I'm able to adjust the earphones to my necessary volume level, and not annoy my wife."
R1SLKZGQUDNFZJ,5,I use these headphones when running or walking on the treadmill and watching TV. Before these I had the TV blasting and still couldn't hear it.
R7Q9ZMOHNQ0X6,4,"Took a few minutes to get them adjusted, but they work great.  Also like the feature of reception out of the line-of-sight.  Can walk around the house and not miss a note.  May go for another pair for my daughter."
R1Y5JIGLLD1T3T,5,"I dropped and broke the first pair of sennheiser heasdphones I purchased, I bought another less expensive brand to replace the one I broke but nothing compares to this brand. although they are a little expensive it's well worth the money you spend the range is off the charts. I go outside get the mail with these headphones on and I can still hear my favorite program crystal clear. with the other set I had to stay in front of the base in order to get reception. also this set completely blocks out any other noises. My noisy neighbohrs are no longer a problem. the headphone are also very comfortable after awhile you forget you have them on. the other ones would start to hurt my ears after wearing them for ore than 10 mins. I highly reccomend them."
RH3EWG5ZT3KR8,5,"These have worked wonderfully for me.  I can use them on the treadmill, or just for watching TV, and can walk though the house, into the garage, or onto the deck and still hear the TV clearly."
R3S9XGPBBWPZDT,5,My father is 91 could not hear the TV unless it was blaring. He thinks this product is the best thing he has ever bought. He is very happy with the product. It is very easy to use just hang it on the bracket to charge.  We received the product two days earlier than expected.  Thank you.
R2RV7T2FZRTEP6,2,Was DOA upon receipt.
R3N6GB1K76UMHE,4,This unit is working well for now. I bought one previously that crapped out in less than a year. Hope it was just a lemon.
R1KJQGRAC3W8DJ,5,Great for watching the T.V. at a volume level others consider loud.
R1PIHL2NCBJHUK,5,Great sound quality.
R3N096929Z3821,5,So far it works just fine. I can have the TV volume turned all the way down and my wife doesn't even know the TV is on.  I am sitting there enjoying the programs  and hearing every word..
RTV3GR33VC179,4,"I like these headphones, I get good range and they're very comfortable on my big head (7 7/8 hat size).  However the connection is old school you have to plug into the audio jack of the device you want to use.  That being said it's still very nice to not have wires tangling up around me on my desk.  I'm not an audiophile but they sound good.  The bass doesn't thump but the mids/highs are clear.  If I had the extra money I would suggest getting the blue tooth connect version but they're another 100 bucks."
R2PWI1J2NIUXJI,4,oops now I am pleased with this product I discovered that the 2nd wheel- not the volume-must be carefully adjusted to avoid volume changes I like this product
R3ODQR841WBDGP,5,Love these. No longer have to go upstairs to read a book while husband watches tv in same room. He loves them too.
R1ONOGZSZXGFOD,5,Bought it for myself and then bought 3 more for gifts.  Awesome for the price.
R1GVUC91RELUE3,2,after 4 months I can no longer tune in the stations.  I am trying to figure out what to do before I contact the manufacturer in friggin China
R2B9M2VJQCTET9,5,Bought these for my husband and he loves them!
R2NR8LQTV569KL,5,The headphones are perfect for two 'pre-geezers' that constantly tell each other to raise or lower the TV volume control.  I love them for sports especially.  Ordering a 2nd pair for my wife.  Today's flat screen TV's fire their audio toward the back making intelligibility difficult.  These headphones are perfect.  Great audio processing too.  Excellent low frequency for proper 'bottom'. Cheers--E
RUISDK639LV1X,5,"I purchased these here on Amazon as a refurbished unit from Bargain Shack. My husband fusses at me when I want to watch TV at night and this was the best solution I could find to keep our marriage happy and healthy!  The item came as described with only the original instruction manual missing which I easily found as a pdf download on the Sennheiser website. These headphones are comfortable and not too heavy. The docking/recharging/transmitter station is also lightweight and easily sits next to the tv with no problem. I found it very easy to instal on my Samsung HDTV and the headphone immediately sprang into action. I didn't have to tune them or adjust them in any way. Excellent sound quality. With my TV I was simply able to turn the tv volume all the way down to &#34;0&#34; and the headphones still function perfectly. They also work while the TV is in regular volume and mute mode, thus providing the opportunity for others in the room to hear programming while I wear the headphones to tune out noise from the kitchen (we have an open floor plan so when the dishwasher is on or the kids are fighting in the dining room I can slip these puppies over my ears and escape into trashy tv for a few blissful moments). Let me wander to the back of the house or out to the pool and I'll let you know how they work.................I'm back! They work at a pretty decent distance. Now I can't expect them to work when I'm out driving around on the golf cart, but hey! I'm going to give that a shot too!"
RQ0L3NZYCZ51R,5,"Although an older unit, they function wonderfully. I can walk around my house and still hear the audio clear, great when getting up to grab a snack or drink, but you don't want to miss anything. Overall a great unit. This company makes great wireless headphones."
RM9ZVSUVSFYUB,5,Very pleased with this product. The volume on the headphones is independent from that of the TV. This permits someone in the room to enjoy the volume at his choice while allowing the user of the headphones to adjust the volume to their needs. The volume in the room may also be adjusted to nearly off and the headphone user can listen without disturbing anyone else. The quality of the sound is excellent.
R1454EXWGFAHYO,5,My husband uses these every day in the nursing home to block the noise of his roommate and nursing home activity.  Great purchase!
RU6HATAZ6TB3I,1,"This is our second pair, the first work perfectly, these have an annoying buzz that won't go away"
R31V6WMG4W4CLC,5,"We bought this for a replacement of a pair of RCA wireless headphones. The overall material and design on this product was a lot better than the RCA. The sound quality was good for the price. If you are looking for above average wireless headphones, this could be perfect."
R3UKNBD4LPA37D,2,"These headphones are okay but not as good as I was led to believe by the reviews here.  I've had a few different brands of wireless headphones. I tried some cheap ones that were junk.  I have a pair of Sony MDR-RF985R wireless headphones in my bedroom.  I bought these for use with a TV in my loft so that I can watch TV there without bothering folks in the rest of the house.  I liked the Sony headphones but thought I'd give these a try because I know that Sennheiser makes quality products.  I wish I'd gotten another pair of the Sonys.<br /><br />When I first received these I almost sent them back because the sound was awful.  Then I remembered reading a review here which talked about the automatic gain control circuit and clipping in these.  I turned down the volume on my receiver and found that the sound quality improved dramatically.  However, if you decrease the volume too much then the sound quality gets poor again.  It's a pretty narrow window which gives acceptable sound.  Even with the input volume set right in the sweet spot, there is still a noticeable hiss, even when I'm right next to the transmitter.  I find myself frequently fiddling with the tuning knob trying to get better sound out of these.  I also dislike that the tuning knob and volume knob are beside each other on these.  I find that I sometime adjust the tuning when I mean to adjust the volume.<br /><br />If I were to do this again, I'd buy another pair of the Sony wireless headphones.  They are a little heavier than these Sennheisers but they are just as comfortable.  The Sony auto tune feature means that you don't have to mess with a tuning knob, you just select a channel and forget about it.  Plus, the Sonys have better sound quality, no noticeable hiss and work much better with a wide range of input volume."
RB7017PDC90GQ,5,The best wireless headphones I've come across.
R3CKUL4YUFMC9K,4,"I've had this for several years. Kind of big & clumsy by today's standards, and the controls are a little difficult to work, but it does the job."
R3OYBU7F0ZDTEJ,4,Work great  Still trying to get use to wearing them
R3KH5UOUGH2A0Q,5,Best cordless head phones I have had.
R1Z416UXOAC1BJ,5,Simple as plugging them in and turning them on.  My husband loves them!
R1AEXPQK932TDP,2,doesn't hold a charge very long
R37BMEJD81O1SV,5,We finally got the head set working.it was the tv that was the problem
R3QMGLK27KM3RW,4,great sound
R3SRB5L53N8WNW,5,Works great!
R1UPQ6P2WTH3G9,5,Product was as described and was new in the box. Headphone have excellent sound and range and I am very happy with them. Order was process quickly and shipped promptly. I would buy from this seller again.
R2E83L5AJNFJ8L,5,This earphones are Awesome.  Have had them for for 5 years and they are still working great.  My husband wears hearing aids and would crank the tv volumne way up.  We live in a close neighborhood and now don't have to worry about rattling the windows with tv volumne.  I don't need them but I do wear them too.  Highly recommend them.
R19DSR9GAXNCYL,5,"These are an excellent VALUE! I bought these to watch TV at night after my husband has gone to sleep, since I get off work very late and need time to wind down (husband is a very light sleeper). Read many reviews of both pros and cons for these headphones. I took a gamble and bought them since the investment was what I could afford at this time. Glad I took the risk. Well worth the investment!!"
R3IDJAU3HEKXJS,5,Excellent Product!
RBGU1O4JFRUTW,5,"Product review: After plugging in it took me a moment to figure out or have the Eureka moment in my mind on how the system worked with various devices like TV, Receiver, etc. I've bought two of these and my in-laws use them without issues. I have not tried other systems so I cannot compare.<br /><br />General overview: Is a must if you have people in your household that need help on hearing or want to watch at a higher volume. Also, it does not disturb other people around if they are trying to sleep or do something else as you can put your device on mute and adjust the volume on these headphones."
R1HBSLILY2K4JN,4,"These are awesome! After the initial charge, now I go to bed and set them on the charger. It lasts even when I do a marathon viewing.<br /><br />I do wish the foam ear pieces were indented or had a ridge or something other than flat tho. That does get a -bit- uncomfortable after a while. So I turn them off during commercials and slide them off to ease the discomfort. Other than that they are fantastic!"
R1HR03UXW1DTTB,5,"We ordered two of these, one for each of us--and absolutely love them!  We tried TV Ears several times, but were never satisfied.  One has to get used to having something over the top of your head (vs. hanging below your chin like TV Ears do), but there is sufficient padding on the headphones so as to be comfortable.  The sound is incredible.  For instance, if the TV screen shows a car coming from your left and leaving the screen on your right, the sound starts in your left headphone and slowly moves to the right headphone.  The headphones pick up background sounds in a program we've never heard before, yet keeps the dialogue foremost and easily understood.  We highly recommend these headphones."
R3KNFMULP36S4O,4,works great
R2MCZ1P617ME37,5,They work great.
RG69NFCA34TAS,5,These a great if you need a little extra volume when you are watching TV.  I think the sound quality is exceptional.  Now my wife and I can both enjoy TV without appropriate volume levels for both of us.  Keeps peace in the family.  I like the way you charge the batteries in the headset by simply placing the phone on the rack.  The light shows it is charging.  Much better than those other models that require you to plug the headphones in.  Highly recommend these and they are very easy to install on your TV.
R29L7TCR2LQU2U,1,every time u tilt your head forward they fall of.  .most of the people who buy these are hearing impared  the valume ranger needs to be more<br />if these have a range from 1 to 10  it needs to be from 1to 12 so u can hear the tv  the tone thing sucks
R1RE99CBNSR45S,5,bought these for my dad and he loves them
RIQRTI2PXU2RX,2,"Have only had these headphones for a several days.  I have hearing loss combined with Tinnitus and purchased these for TV viewing; or should I say listening.  They do exactly what I expected them to do.  I wanted over the ear but those were more expensive than I was willing to pay for something unknown.  I am not a long distance viewer watching only about 1 1/2 hours nightly.  These are comfortable over this time.  Someone with Tinnitus cannot be an audiophile so I cannot attest to any existence of a hum or hiss.  But, I am really enjoying watching shows and understanding probably 99% of conversation versus maybe 70%; even with hearing aids.  The bonuses are 1) my wife can finally listen at her preferred volume and, 2) I can listen to a program and turn the TV sound off.  Revised:  The set stopped working the first week of June....so happy for only a few weeks."
R3O8X204SQ7O2D,5,"Extraordinary in quality, comfort and sound. Exceeded expectations in every way. Easy installation, operation and excellent reception from far and wide."
R3FYGXNTHQNSXI,4,"a definite upgrade from the RS110 by Sennheiser, yet the same price.  beats the RS110 in sound quality and has a rechargeable battery and charging station.  range is decent.  and best of all - I can now take my music with me when im on the toilet."
R2EV6UHK8ZZKPP,5,92 year old dad LOVED these!  Said it was the BEST gift ever!  Good quality.  Good price.  Would definitely order again!
R3PVDZV6P0MRLK,1,"It worked fine when it was first received.  After only 3 months it quite.  Of course, it cannot be returned"
R2PYJE9WV8K8Q7,5,works well...no interference
RA2MO1GWT8P89,5,"One of my best investments.... Not only does it keep the neighbors from hearing my TV, it also keeps me from hearing any neighbor noise."
R1VAZ8EZ255R0P,5,the headphones are well designed and sound; including surround<br />is great! thanks
R9Q85D070VMEW,4,"Sounds great, has replaceable rechargeable battery, comes with 3.5 to larger headphone adapter along with RCA plugs. I recommend a Optical to RCA adapter's sold here on amazon if TV only has headphone out but also Optical and you want both TV speakers and these to work independently.<br /><br />Negatives. The &#34;tune&#34; button isn't &#34;tone&#34; but actually frequency and it's right under the volume knob on the headphone. It's the worse design ever, you keep hitting it by accident. On the positive you can you fine tune it, but you hit it accidentally so many times you are annoyed by hitting it instead of tune. I have a pair of platronics TV wireless for the bedroom and it auto tunes. makes more sense.<br /><br />The notches seem unnecessary in todays wireless charging aging. but it works."
R1E9Q0DHFN6SB8,3,"Not comfortable after an hour, which is a shame as they are really good sound and performance wise."
R2NG951PUTL2GX,1,Headphones are loose and cannot be tightened on the head and fall off if head is tipped down.  No matter how well they may work the poor attachment detracts from the overall operation
R2VW6M1UMM5FX1,5,"First of all I would like to explain something. My husband was working in construction and would get laid off for anywhere from 5 to 6 months in the Winter time. :-(  Well, I am a homemaker and I like quiet during the day as I worked in a very noisy environment for many years. It would drive me insane to have him home when he was laid off and watching TV all day with the volume up so loud because he is quite hard of hearing in one ear! My best friend had a wireless headset that she never used so she sent it to us. What a relationship saver!!! We have had it close to 8 years now and it started falling apart. I ordered this headset for him and he/we couldn't be more happy with it! It was very easy for him to set up and it works beautifully with no static or hissing and he can even walk around the house with it on and still no static. We highly recommend this headset! By the way, he got a different job and works year round now but I can still enjoy my quiet when he is home on the weekends! :-) Great purchase!"
R1E3D63IVA3CRO,4,"Great sound but my personal preference is &#34;over the ear&#34;.  If this is non issue for you, would highly recommend"
R3SKD13Z8SF0I4,5,"Great sound, range and overall quality for under $100.<br /><br />4100"
R13FFC8YX43GK7,5,Great thing about them is that they work independent of my Samsung TV built in speakers
R3QG9X9VRY4YIK,5,thanks
R3NG4G1PF9D15K,5,I havent had them long but so far they are the best i've ever had. I am partially deaf and these earphones will give more volume than any I have ever owned. The sound quality is good too. They arrived 1 day sooner than they  originally said they would. I recomend both the product and the seller.
R37RHQR28DP7CL,5,A+
R2KM5I5LNIVO82,3,So far so good
R2DEJY8G9QB930,5,"These are great!  With our Dynex TV, these work great only comment is I wish they had a Mute button.  Otherwise fantastic."
RXSBATCNIQ06O,5,completely satisfactory and as described
R20D1AUN4S44ZH,4,Excellent product. I thought they were going to be stereo but I don't believe so.
RN0JBJRLW0A7N,5,This just flat out does not work as advertised. The frequency gets distorted and messes up the sound and my tv is only 25-30 feet away in a bedroom. You are better off watching with closed caption. Totally disappointed.  UPDATE- was not using the product correctly and figured it out. The product works very well. My apologies to the company. This was worth the money and my wife doesn't hear me watching Friends on Nick at Nite. Have I said too much?
R2TCD5497ZB0EE,1,5 stars considering cost and quality
R2SL1CVWRFN0X8,5,"Clear, strong sound. Easy on the ears, I would recommend the RS120 to anyone who wants high quality sound for a reasonable price."
R160GQO7PGHV26,5,Worked very well. last all day under charge. Gives better sound quality than TV speakers.
R1P7FZXMX0XCW5,1,Once set up you headphone with you tv there is bad nose come out from head phone. It is not working at all. Plus you have to pay for return shipment which is not fear
R18C3COCE57R8A,4,"At first use, I had a lot of static but it seemed to have gone away. It's now working great."
R2WFKTTSNUQV6R,4,"Spend a few dollars more and buy once. One draw back is that control settings on head device are easily changed when handing, otherwise this is a five star rating."
R1DZJKH7IDN2Z0,5,"Great sound, clear, no &#34;noise,&#34; excellent range &, battery life, very comfortable. THE best way to watch TV when you want to hear everything well - from the music to the dialogue - and not disturb others, especially if they're sleeping!  I've used this one almost every evening for for over 6 years; trouble free and only had to replace the rechargeable batteries once. I love these wireless headphones! I recommend them for anyone, especially those that often find it difficult to understand all the dialogue. What a difference they make!"
R3HDUUF3H0JKOG,5,I absolutely love these.  I have a very small house so when my daughter is studying and I want to watch TV the volume can disturb her concentration.  Now I just put the headphones on and voila we are both happy!
R18FH9JZU2Z330,5,He loves it.  Works great.
R370EZQP2ATKNM,4,"These are great! I can still hear the TV even when I go out into the back yard. Don't waste your money on other junk, like TV Ears1"
R1VL4YBL3OMEZN,5,"I bought these headphones to use with Rocksmith 2014 PC edition and they do a fantastic job. Setup was as simple as plugging the base into the headphones input on my PC, making that connection my default device and changing the audio to 16 bit 48000 Hz (DVD quality). Absolutely no lag, awesome sound quality and my game play has improved significantly since using them. If you're researching wireless headphones to play RS2014 with, get these. You won't be disappointed.  Update: After owning these headphones nearly a year, I figured I'd give a quick update. These headphones still work perfectly. I mainly use them for playing guitar, either through Rocksmith 2014 for PC or with my Zoom G3X multi effects pedal. FANTASTIC clarity and sound for guitar. My playing efficiency and accuracy has increased significantly after getting these headphones. Plus my neighbors don't hate me for blasting an amp at 3 AM! I've also used them for watching movies and listening to music. This was one of the best purchases I've ever made."
R3632FKV87VFXS,4,These are really great headphones for the price and work really well.  I like the different adapters they provide.  My only issue is that it is cumbersome to move around the house as the base needs to be plugged in to whatever you want to listen to so if you are using your ipod you need to leave it near the dock plugged in the whole time.  Otherwise great sound and a GREAT price.
R1UDOP247ATNS7,1,"Good, Comfortable on the ears. Good sound quality. One does not have to sit directly in front of T.V. and/or sending unit. Not so Great, Having to repeated 're-tune the headphones. NO indicator light showing the headphones are ON. Having to repeated re-tune headphones. Have I mentioned that the tuning dial is right next to the volume dial and therefore is easily bumped requiring one to 're-tune the headphones?"
R13L12T7XLII10,5,I am hard of hearing. I find background music in current detective programs made the conversations impossible to understand.  No problem with this unit.  It is remarkable that I can use it equally well with or without my hearing aids.  I can use it many hours without recharging the batteries.
R39U6D0OQPEH27,5,I love these headphones and they're so easy to use.
R2IZRZYDV9ZSGM,4,This an excellent product.
R3R5EIFD2D31NP,5,"Great headphones, no static and a decent price:)"
R5B21J0OOH8S1,4,"Great sound quality. I have to be careful to put the headphones straight on the base. I wish that the base were a bit more stable. I keep it by my recliner, and I've knocked the base off the end table multiple times as I put the headphones back on."
R1TB3B8O56J7W3,2,"Not impressed with these, as they emit a hiss when using.  Can't seem to get rid of it."
R3578QGLT7DREQ,5,"my wife of 60 years loves that she does not have to wear earplugs,when i watch TV"
RXQTPS8OQQY4T,3,It is very good as sound quality but a little heavy.
RR72TG4TCAN36,1,Could not get these set up and kept getting a lot of static.  Sent them back.
R28G5KWQI1MHB8,5,"I purchased these HEADphones after years of another brands EAR phones. The other brands head gear hung underneath your chin with 2 ear pieces on either side that you had to INSERT into your ears like ear buds. This always caused me pain especially if I wore for more then an hour.<br />These headphones are padded perfectly, easily adjustable to your head size and are like soft pillows. The sound is great. You can easily adjust the sound and volume on the sides.of the headphones.<br />The set up was 1,2,3 . I use them almost every night so I do not disturb the other sleepers in the house.<br />11/18/15-Just purchased another pair for vac home.  These Headphones are so worth every penny."
R2JWCOM2XSZFP5,2,This product is horrible. The reception is very bad and completely noticeable when walking 4 feet away from the box. Don't waste your money.
R2OES6QVNWVPT7,4,"If I had looked closer, I would have seen that a charger was required. We figured that out after we read more so another order was required , works ok just haven't used much."
RIVBB79ZU323N,4,Extremely helpful for clear audio reception for tv/cable programs - especially when there is music in the background.
R2T9HDT8MEOWE,1,I bought this to give as a present. I was so embarrassed as gifts were opened at the birthday party to find out that my gift was used!!! Nowhere did I see that this item was used or refurbished. As the receipient pointed out that the instruction booklet had writing on it and the headset had batteries. It was pretty embarrassing as I thought I bought a new item. The extra headset wass new.
R2FVGO3ICHVOXM,5,great head phones - good buy
RJJUVE85YD84C,4,"the disturbance irritates when nothing plays on the TV for a while so you are forced to shut it down when u stop watching the tv.<br />the sound at its max deteriorates the quality, maybe if kept at 90%volume, its sounds best, no distturbance while watching tv as such, all in all a good product<br />PS: dont expect good bass from these"
R28S22AV2B9K9O,4,Only drawback is that it slips off of the head too easily and there is no capability to mute commercials easily. Other than that it is very satisfactory.
R2DOHL4O0LWOFA,5,Works as advertised.  Has very good sound and serves my purpose
RUALKC8K3CWTS,1,I am still having difficulty getting the earphones to function while the audio is also on for other viewers. It presently works only while TV is muted.
R1GUA0YC4YW88K,5,Works great.  Easy to use and is comfortable to wear.  I am pleased with the purchase and the quality of the unit.
R1JNYZVPYA5TPS,5,Outstanding speakers! Took me like 3 minutes to set up! Amazing quality and the sound is truly exceptional
RIW8AZPQ42846,3,"Does a good job of conveying sound to your ears.  Does a poor job of staying put on your head!  Has a tendency to fall off if you lean forward too far.  Also subject to being displaced from your ear if you turn your head while sitting in a high-backed chair.  Consequently, don't use it all the time."
RKNB145BZY81U,5,I am very pleased with these ear phones. The sound quality is first rate and seems almost in stereo. I can hear the minutest sound which I was probably missing before. I also might add I do not have a hearing loss but an inferior sound system on my TV
R3CWW9O6JQ6J16,4,This is a wonderful device that enables me to hear my TV in a comfortable manner.  I now have two of these and can enjoy TV anywhere in my house.
RO24YT6E78JJ,4,They work fine but a little hard to adjust to clear audio.  Static turns on if the volume is too low on the tv.
R3JJYZJH2K7KX9,1,"Wouldn't work, did everything it said to do, but it would not tune in.  Tried everything...maybe a bad headphone, who knows, all I could get was static, and the only time I could hear the tv through the headphones is if the tv itself was audible...."
R1D2F05ZPZIEO8,4,These are such good headphones.  My only complaint it that after a while of wearing them my ears begin to get too warm.  Other than that I<br />think they are really great and have such a good tone to them.
R7ID03V6CORKX,4,I like the good range it has for listening.
RWUQ9ZRUOZD8D,5,"Great product, helps my 84 year old father hear the television better without disrupting others."
R2HEIH182NOSLL,5,The headphones work great for me!
RSG270V2VXMQU,5,GREAT
R76EQTLELWDC0,3,"When  it works it's good, but only works about 50% of the time."
RSPJA3RFDLHBK,4,"The sound quality of these is awesome. Pay no attention to people complaining about the tuning and volume knobs being too close to each other, that's a silly complaint unless you have giant fingers and even then...also people complaining about the auto-shutoff feature...it turns right back on when you turn your tv or DVD or whatever you were listening to back on...so stop just being complainy.<br />I did find that when I walked into a room that had multiple walls between me and the base unit there was interference. But it will for the most part work well in a two bedroom apartment. I love it."
R1QJZDD6NG0TDV,4,"Replaced 10yr. old Radio Shack set that fell on floor and shattered. So glad that happened! (BuBYe). No reception issues, easy to install (into cable box), mute the TV and I can continue to view into dawn without disturbing anyone else."
R27VP4KVVS4MNG,5,Much better than TV Ears!!!
R1LH7A44CVS4D3,5,"I really like these headphones. They are very well designed both for easy charging and for comfort. The sound quality is really good - no hiss and very clear sound with good bass. I have the unit connected to the &#34;audio out&#34; on the TV and this has no effect upon the TV speakers, so the TV can either be muted or producing sound while using the headphones. The headsets are nicely padded and very comfortable and do not make my ears hurt. I would definitely purchase these again and my wife, who no longer is disturbed by my late night TV watching, would strongly agree."
R1RTFU6KY4S8CL,1,"I bought the RS120's to work in the yard without having to worry about the cord. The sound was average at best. The small rotational dial on the bottom for &#34;tuning&#34; never quite locked in to my wireless signal so the sound was always full of static or very soft, even when I was standing right next to the sending device.  I really wanted these to work because of the easy charging design and the over the ear fit. I was VERY disapointed in this Sennheiser product."
R2SJIIK0BY660A,5,We can finally have the tv at a normal level and my wife can hear every word on the tv with these headphones!  She loves them.
R1R3VR62VLUL2U,5,Being a little hard of hearing I have been really pleased that this device makes what you are hearing very specific...It is like all that is being said is emphasized and modulated to a higher degree than normal speaking without the device...It fits very well and you can wear them for an entire 4 hour movie and hardly know you have them on. I would recommend them for anybody that wants a far better listening experience...GREAT product
R151H4GSXH7BVC,5,Very good product.
R1Y1JG9VIQ5576,5,"I got my first pair of these headphones years ago, maybe about eight years ago . They work great and I wear them late at night so I can have the television as loud as I want without disturbing anybody. During the day while I am busy I use them while cooking and cleaning and am going from room to room. They have a pretty good radius even when you go outside.  I live in an apartment building so the neighbors don't have to listen to my music. They use rechargeable batteries that have twelve to eighteen hours before they need to go back on the charger. I bought a second pair so that I have a backup for when I forget to put them on the charger. Also in a pinch you can use regular batteries. I don't think that I have a hearing problem, but think that these would be great if you do."
R32ZA6MIJSG6LS,5,Works Great in my office. Charge last all day- 9+ hours. Just wish they were a little lighter.
RCS4ODZDKOITJ,1,"I have had it for a few months now and it never worked well. I got it for the TV. When I attach it, it works for a few minutes and then at any moment there is a harsh static sound blasting in your ears -  the connection is lost. If I remove the connection and reconnect it, it will go back to normal, but in a few minutes it goes back to the static. This, by the way, is startling and causes you to remove the headset off your ears as quick as possible, it is so loud and unpleasant. Does not work well, or at all, so save your money."
R2Z11GHOLXVX5U,4,"Good sound. Very good range, far from the unit."
RFX33FO2NPNY1,5,This was for my to use since my Mother got her first hearing aids.  Dad loves the special surround sound and the great quality of sound.  We also like the wireless factor so there are no lines for anyone to trip on.
R3RR13NDT7IQ47,5,AWESOME My husband gets up at 5:30 am.  I hear perfectly walking the whole house. I highly recommend .
RW54LW1ZL6III,4,"WORKS WELL WITH-IN ABOUT 50 FT OR SO, EVEN THROUGH WALLS, HAVING TROUBLE ADJUSTING FIT ON HEAD, OF COURSE IT COULD BE OPERATOR ERROR, RATHER THEN A ISSUE WITH THE PRODUCT, ALL IN ALL VERY SATISFIED"
R1O3SGNAK4VMA6,1,I was so excited for this product.  My parents are unable to hear the TV unless it is very high volume.  They have a headset but needs the batteries changed every other day.  This product worked for a couple hours and then was out of commission for 24 hours to charge.  If you turned down the television it turned down the volume on the headset and so defeated the purpose of having the headset.
R1RL66UA0X9MPK,1,Did not work.unable to hear sound
R2ZCAIGT9HT4SG,5,"great product, quality and price are great"
R2OHUSN8ZL87JB,5,"These work great, especially when wife goes to bed early, tired of her telling me TV is too loud."
RFJJWYUPQ01AL,4,"As far as using this product it should be five stars, it works like a dream. However, the initial setup was far from simple and don't know if I would have managed it without the technical knowledge I have. If they have a video support site I didn't find it but it might have made installation a breeze."
R3LM1NKMSCE31M,5,It was more then I expected.
R1B2I03ERXREF7,2,"Returned these after several attempts to get them to not have a bunch of static when they were dialed in as good as they could possibly be to my TV. Go for the newer Sennheiser RS 175 RF Wireless Headphones. Yes, the RS 175's are much more expensive. But, you get what you pay for and the RS 175's are amazing."
R3GBEAS6IBKBN3,5,"love them, sound great easy to hook up ...I bought these to drown out the barking dog next door while I am watching TV, they do the job..."
R1O3NZWUTS8X8P,4,Great headphones for the price !
R2IARUVGDFKWEV,5,"fantastic, makes it more enjoyable watching TV.  It's like being in the theater all the time."
R38IQ48NRG2FWQ,4,Works well!
RZD0W6FS8UUZY,4,"Had a hard time getting unit to work.  Plug that goes to television is wrong size and had to &#34;rig&#34; it to work at all.  Instructions are not clear for setup.  Once I got it working, only thing I dislike is that the headsets that go to my head keep me from watching TV lying on my side."
RUWA6JRQS8P8A,5,Works really good. Worth the buy.
R2L0OESK99RHPY,5,I returned it because it's too bulky. Will place an order for TV Ears very soon
R2MU2J963X225N,4,"I bought this headset to listen to television while walking on our treadmill so I don't have to turn the volume of the TV up and make everyone in the house listen to my show.  I connected the supplied wires, installed the two supplied AAA rechargeable batteries, turned the earphones on and the sound began to play immediately without any channel changes or fine tuning.  The RCA style connectors are hardwired to the base with a 7 foot long cable, but Sennheiser supplies an RCA to 3.5 mm adapter and a 3.5 mm to 1/4 inch adapter.  Using the RCA connectors plus the mini jack plus the phono adapter would be a 5&#34; long, rigid assembly.  I have not had any interference or hiss inside our standard bi-level house but the sound does start breaking up when I go outside.  This headset has an open earpiece that sits on the ears and is replacing an Auvio unit with closed earpieces that surrounded my ears.  One advantage to the open design is that you will be able to hear questions from other people and respond without removing the headset.  The pressure on my ears starts to become uncomfortable around the hour mark.  The sound is comparable to the speakers in my 42&#34; Sony flat screen TV.  I suspect the headset would fall off anyone working on their hands and knees, but has not been a problem for my wife (petite head) or for me (larger head) while putting on shoes or walking upright.  The headset may be a little tight if you are a 250 pound man.  The charging/transmission base is 3 inches wide by 5 inches deep by 9 inches high.  The width increases to 8 inches when the headset is placed on the base.  The charging base is not especially stylish.  I bought the Sennheiser RS120 because it operates at 900 MHz.  Higher frequency units pick up static from my treadmill.  Placing the headset on the wire charging loops is not a problem.  The headset has a power switch, a volume control dial, and a fine tuning dial.  The fine tuning and volume dials are located close to each other.  Ifyou can't remember to turn the top dial or don't have sufficient physical dexterity, you can accidently move the fine tuning dial and lose your sound.  I have never had that problem, but I suppose it could be a consideration.  The base does not have a power switch.  It turns itself off a couple minutes after the TV is turned off and turns on when the TV comes on.  I have never had the base turn off while watching TV or while I am searching for a recorded show from my DVD to watch.  The ear pieces drop down 1 and 1/2&#34; on each side, pivot about 20 degrees around one axis only and are permanently rotated a little around the vertical axis to match the human head.  The rotation promotes comfort while increasing the tendency for the headset to slide off the head, especially while leaning forward.  The Sennheiser  does not control the sound from the TV, that is a function of the TV design.  For example, my Sony can be set to mute the TV when a headset is plugged it or leave the sound alone.  September 2016 Update - After approximately 2 hours of use per day and 5 days per week since purchased, the headphones are working like new and no changes to the original review are required."
R1M9SEJJ1WJMUN,5,"Have these connected to TV-easy installation. Helps my wife to listen as her hearing is bad, keeps volume of TV low while others are sleeping but can control volume on headset to comfortable level, watch a lot of English mysteries on Public TV and headsets make it easier to understand the British accents. This is the third one I have purchased and they are all working. Highest quality product from a quality manufacturer."
R3IHBPABQWSKHH,5,Excellent sound & comfort
R7NTL6DYLNG7M,1,Bought it for Christmas.  What a waste of money! Never worked well.Had so much static and could not get a clear reception.<br />Do not buy this product.
R28ME7OWHJ0848,5,The headphones allow me to enjoy television much more.  I have hearing aids but the phones work much better.  I like the clarity and distinctness of the voices.  A good buy for an old man with poor hearing.  I like the convenience of hearing as I go to refill my coffee cup - I do not miss a thing.
RWJ8H64R2U1JS,5,"Meets and surpasses every expectation. Great sound, range, features. Near perfect. Only flaw is the running dial location is easily bumped being near the volume but being aware helps. Sound stays good without breaking up even through several walls. Just love this one and plan on getting another one for the other TV room."
R1CLKR7SSG66WL,5,Now I can sleep without listening to my wife's TV show
R1PB1MMN803V7H,5,perfect for late nite tv in an apartment complex. I like the sound loud and now my it does not bother anyone else.
R1WIL1SWNNYUAV,4,Love them. Bought a second pair to take back to CDA.<br />Has eliminated a lot of arguments over TV volume.  Love the quiet😀😀
R14HH2PIRHKWTK,1,"THEY ARE VERY EASY TO INSTALL, MAKE SURE YOUR TV HAS THE CAPABILITY TO AN AUDIO OUT LINE, THE CABLES THAT COME ARE RED AND BLACK, MY TV HAD AN OUTPUT OF RED AND WHITE, I STILL CONECTED IT AND IT WORKED, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO YOUR TV MENU AUDIO SETTINGS TO DISABLE THE AUDIO SO YOU DONT GET AUDIO COMING OUT OF YOUR TV ALSO....  THE HEADSET IS LIGHT, FEELS GOOD BUT YOU GET SOME SCRATCHY NOISE, ITS HARDLY CLEAR!, THE WAY YOU FIND THE AUDIO COMING OUT OF THE TV IS BY TURNING A KNOB IN THE HEADSET, WHILE YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL HEAR LOCAL RADIO STATIONS( THIS IS ANNOYING)  I ONLY USE THEM WHEM MY WIFE SLEEPS!!

THANKS!!LEASE LET ME KNOW!! THANKS!!"
R35796HUFX4MNS,2,"I use headphones with an electronic musical instrument. The right headphone in my first order produced a strong buzz / rattle when I played the A below the treble clef. I returned the product as defective and requested a replacement. This time, the buzz is in the left ear, at exactly the same pitch. I'm returning it and will find another brand."
R2XJM75K0SHPUG,4,Works  just fine
R2T0ZR124P48ZX,5,"I love them.  They are comfortable and one of the best features is that the batteries are rechargable, unlike two previous other brands.  Once the batteries wouldn't recharge on the stand, they were toast.  These have batteries in the head set and can be changed.  I highly recommend them."
R22I8YPZ7T6J7Y,4,This product works great and was simple to install
R3Q11L18LC0PI7,5,Tried a less expensive Blurex model that didn't work. Got this and it's perfect.
R1QF2MW7474Z19,3,started out fine--pure sound.  It has developed static making it less desirable..
R11640NFIT3NW,1,"There is something wrong with the Transmitter. The green light goes off from the Transmitter after few minutes resulting in disconnection of sound. Again when I take off the 3mm jack and place it back, the sound signal comes back. I am really upset about this and its now almost unusable."
R26ILZ3E57E9RE,5,"I have had these before, but after about 5 years of constant use they gave up on me, so I bought these which I like just as well.  They are probably the same model with a different number.  I use them almost every night to watch TV and they are so good for that.  Good product."
R29DPN3NGFW38S,4,"The headphone works and fits fine.  The right ear cushion is easily dislodged, but as easily replaced. Really not a problem if you handle it carefully."
R1QE5OJU6BXQHB,5,"Best Televison blue-tooth headphones I've ever owned (at least five other models tried). Sennheiser's have an excellent reputation and deserve it, despite their conservative design approach. The emphasis has always been on quality, and that's still true. These are very well-designed, easy on the ear-drums, and comfortable, despite obvious size. I haven't had to replace the batteries in over three years despite countless hours of ownership. I own two sets of Senn's now. Sony and smaller name-brands do not seem to compare, unless you are oblivious to quality (sorry Sony, headphones only). Range is exceptional. Depending on the quality of sound in older TV models, you may discover there is a low, but definite threshold for minimum sound reception (i.e., TV must be set at a louder level to maintain sound in the headphones). For newer model LCDs, LEDs, plasmas (if they make them any more), this does not apply unless you go bargain basement. My next set will be .. you guessit it!!"
R1LCGD3WUSX8TU,1,"Sennheiser made my first wired headphones back in the 70's when they were actually made in Germany so I had high expectations for this product.  My Advent wireless headphones had crumbling foam after about 15 years so I was going to treat myself to these Sennheisers.  Unfortunately they spent all their engineering on being able to recharge the batteries just by setting the headphones on the stand, but at the same time the headphone design does not grip your head well.  They may be fine if you only plan to sit still on the couch, but I want to vacuum or do laundry or otherwise stay busy and these phones kept falling off with every quick turn of the head or look down at the floor.  And I have a big head!  What a disappointment!  I am sending them back and going to glue some new foam on my old Advents."
RY4AIU5XDY9NL,4,great item.
RDKIY7AFC7MRR,5,Great headphones works long range with no problems and comfortable
R1YYQZFPF5R1DY,5,I have two of these wireless headphones. High quality with surprising battery power. I can watch tv at my choice of volume without disturbing anyone.
R36Z95HAJD26O7,5,I've had my Senheiser RS120 for a few months now. I use them for my TV when I don't want to interrupt my wife's work. I have not had any of the reported static problems. The sound quality and distance of reception has exceeded my expectations.
R2TO50ZCJBPEIR,1,These head phones are aweful! Lots of static and I have to reposition them alot because It loses the signal very easy! Whoever gave this a 3/4 stars rate is mistaken! :(
R30V16EDBOOFRH,5,"I've tried so many headphones and these are awesome !!  they give you 3 different adapters to attach to your TV or cable box, whichever works.  And you can go online for help.  You can keep TV audible to everyone while you're wearing them OR you can mute the sounds on tv and listen thru the headphone only.  I love these and they're very comfortable.  FINALLY foiund a pair that works.!!!!!"
R3RIGTC7RPPSWP,5,Better then expected
R2F7AAXDO7SSBT,5,great...!
R1YFN8TQ5FVHUJ,5,i odder a second unit but got only head phones i need docking kit charger
R196T1EU9VB3E4,2,"I was super excited for these, because I've heard nothing but good things about Sennheiser. I expected the audio quality to be top notch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these headphones were a significant disappointment. I have since returned them.<br /><br />I will say that the audio WAS good--deep bass, full sound, etc--they felt like &#34;studio&#34; headphones.<br /><br />However, the overall experience was terrible, due to several factors:<br /><br />1. They have an awful &#34;power saving&#34; feature that forces the base (but not the headphones!) off, every five minutes. If you are watching a video and put it on pause, you had better remember to turn off the headphones, or you risk hurting your ears with the loud and obnoxious static that appears when the base is off.* Also, you had better make sure there is some audio playing BEFORE you turn the headset on, or you will be subjected to the same horrible static.<br /><br />2. There is an intermittent &#34;hiss&#34;, as if it is cycling through frequencies and continually hitting a noisy range. No amount of channel switching or playing with the slider can get rid of this.<br /><br />3. The range is meager. Unlike the Logitech headset that I bought as a replacement, these have trouble reaching through a door. Depending on how I sit, the hissing can become worse.<br /><br />4. The headset was heavy, and a little too tight, making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods.<br /><br />5. They don't have separate microphone and headphone adapters, so it is impossible to use them with standard computer jacks without an additional purchase.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend against purchasing these headphones, unless these five issues are not important to you.<br /><br />* Seriously, who's great idea was it to turn the BASE off, but not the headphones? How does that even save power? There's no battery in the base! The battery's in the headphones! All this useless feature does is train you to constantly second-guess yourself, &#34;Hm...should I turn them off, or will I have audio going in time? Better safe than sorry, I guess...&#34; Ugh."
RO7FVE12IJFX,3,Too difficult to set up.
R11D7V2GZT142J,5,"I am hard of hearing, so volume was a concern as have tried other headphones and they didn't get loud enough. These R120's get plenty loud, and the charge lasts 6-8 hours of continuous play. Thumbs up."
R4T1AKVLO1Q1N,5,"sound ts great , range is supper, a little bit heavy, can't bend over with them on my head."
RCOR43R3U64KU,5,"excellent product, recommended it to many people we know with the same need."
RBH9C5SEOF9DK,5,Best wireless sound.  Had mine for a while.  Never had to replace batteries.
R1OJHNP0EH6O5S,2,Returned these. They just didn't fit well.
R1QOLW32EQKM2A,5,easy to use and keeps peace in the house
R19JNQKZ1XMB8J,5,The only problem with this is I have very very fine hair and the headphones slip off quite often.  Any suggestions?
R2189H3FZWAN4L,5,"Have had many pair of headphones over the years. 76 years old and hearing impaired all my life.<br />Use them to watch TV, have a set same as these for 2 years, never had a problem.<br />They are the most comfortable & clear set I have ever had, so I got another set to replace an old<br />pair on another TV."
R3OKTYW7RYIKUV,1,"Sadly this has a signal issue that screams feedback into your ears if it isn't receiving a signal, or if it hasn't received one for a minute or two. The deafening noise overcomes the benefit of not having a wire on your headphones.  Finally one day when I had a migraine headache and the headset squealed at me when it I ended up throwing them away after owning them for just a few months.  I wouldn't even share that pain with anyone by giving them away."
R298SOULLXURF5,5,They're just splendid.
R1XN8RZPGOD7NI,3,Sound is excellent but the headphones fall off my head if I move around or do anything except sit on the couch
R1DNKSJW38TRJT,4,The sound is great.  The only complaint I have is there is no adjustment and they seem a little loose.  I can leave the room and still hear the program I am listening to. I use them to watch tv in the same room with my husband and the sound does not  bother my husband. The quality of sound is much better than the sound the of just the tv. I am happy with my purchase
R34EGVOIAC0G72,4,Well built and work great with the television.  Would recommend these to anybody.
R2K7STWJMED2VO,5,"Great product.  My mother lived with us for over a year before passing away.  TV volume was always a problem (way to loud).  The great thing about this product is the headset volume is independent of the TV/DVR/DVD volume.  This enabled mom to set the volume for her own listening pleasure, while we listened at normal volume from the TV.  It also enabled mom to listen to the TV while I muted the room sound and read a book.<br /><br />The headset recharges by placing in on the wire bars as seen in the picture.  Well made with very good acoustical performance.  The transmission range is also very good.  When I would use them I could roam the house and still listen to a football or baseball game as I went about my business.  If something exciting happened, I would run back to see the replay (or backup the DVR).  Extremely pleased with the product."
RHURORUVET65F,4,These headphones work great
R2KD4UY4W4E3C3,5,These headphones are amazing and really help my wife and I enjoy television without hurting our children's or visitor's eardrums.  Thank you for such great service.
R3MMM2HLWVQ3V,4,good
R1YJES6BKPMHD8,4,I am very satisfied.
R1AKC5Y9EORB7H,4,Works fine.  Call for setup.  Online instructions were not that clear.
R36FRV3CG57Q3Y,4,"Great headphones. Comfortable. The static hiss when a show has been paused or muted for a couple of minutes is annoying, though. Only drawback."
R17UX60NTU0WQB,5,An awesome acquisition.  While not deaf I'm a bit hard of hearing and doing my time on the treadmill I couldn't get the TV turned up loud enough.  Also there are some shows on tv where the actors voice is to high for me to understand.  These take care of the issue.  Love them.  Easy to setup too.
R2D5N040QMY2Z8,4,We had TV ears before these are MUCH BETTER
R2A1ZMFD7OPP91,5,"We love it, especially the range while working in the garden."
R199KORSLN6H45,4,Good tone.  Quality sound.  Uncomfortable after a long period of time.
RCW7PLQ02B5XQ,5,"We've had these for years (I want to say at least 5 years, but I'll have to check on that). I use them while on the treadmill, and sometimes if I want to watch something the wife doesn't want to watch.<br /><br />The sound quality is good.<br /><br />The great part is that their rechargeable. We haven't had to fuss with the batteries ever.<br /><br />We don't use them every day, but they've definitely lasted.<br /><br />I'm about to order another pair for another room, since it seems that 2 pair can interoperate on different channels."
R1FFXE3999W267,5,Super headphones
RJXXWEZ0ZXLI2,4,"These headphones work great for what I needed them for: playing my Xbox One in a crowded and noisy household without disturbing others. Before you buy, however, I would suggest taking a good look at your television set. I didn't realize until I purchased these and spent several hours of troubleshooting them, but a lot of new television sets (such as my newer, bare bones Samsung 52&#34; plasma) actually DON'T come with the &#34;Audio Out&#34; ports that these headphones—and indeed any other external sound system—require to work. You'll more than likely have a  &#34;Digital Optical Out&#34; port, which works great with no audio lag…provided that you have a digital optical audio-to-RCA adapter to make use of it. I didn't know this at the time, and it wound up costing me another $65 to get the additional adapter and optical cable.<br /><br />That being said, these headphones look and sound great, and I've had no problems with battery life or sound quality. The only complaint I have is that with the volume and tuning wheels on the same side on the back on the device, I sometimes confuse the two and wind up setting my device out of tune with my television set. I'm sure that it just takes a little getting used to, but as of yet, I haven't reached that level of proficiency."
R2YNQF8Z12MQ9V,4,I bought this for my boyfriend for when he likes to watch tv late at night and I want to go to sleep. He seems to like them but says they have a hissing sound sometimes...
R3FSASIREMI6NH,5,"Works great, easy to set up, and operate."
R1EWX97XH24FZL,1,Doesn't work. Tried to connect to my TV and DVR in every way imaginable and it never worked. Headphones wouldn't sit on cradle to charge. Very disappointed.
R2YC1961VMO3B1,2,These headphones work fine for about 20 minutes and then I get loud static that lasts for varying periods of time. I cannot get rid of the static although they seem to be going for slightly longer amounts of time before they blast me again.
R3BDGN328ZPW60,3,A
R334YEAA62TONR,5,"We LOVE this headset !<br /><br />We had one for over two years, used pretty much daily and it's still in EXCELLENT condition. We bought a second one for another room, and the nice thing is that we can use BOTH on the SAME receiver to watch TV at night with my wife without waking up the kids.<br />This thing is very well built, and it's actually very hard to tell the new one from the 2yo one (ok this was only handled by adults, so it might have helped a bit). The headset is nicely adjustable for small and large heads. You can even keep receiving the sound from two rooms away, which is nice if you have to do a bathroom break without pausing. The only slightly negative side is that the sound might have a bit of background noise at low volumes sometimes, hardly an issue with movies, but if you are watching/listening to an opera or classical music, it could be an annoyance.<br /><br />Looking forward to years of use. If you have the money, there is a higher-end model available (RS170), but it's almost 3x the price, and the main reason we didn't consider it was that we wanted to make sure we had two compatible systems in the house."
R32NXOE8TE8G3F,5,"works out perfectly, no complaints."
R2PWTL9WNBYX24,4,"These wireless headphones are a nice set. I really like the features they have such as the adjustable tuning and the nice way you just place the headset on the charging stand. No plugs or cords involved at all at least in dealing with the headset that is. The range on the these things are phenomenal! I was expecting 20-25 ft. at best but I've been as far away as 40 ft. from the transmitter with no dropouts or signal degradation. The only issue I have with these is I wished they were the over-the-ear type and not the on-top-of-the-ear. They were on sale so I knew that when I purchased them. At least, for me, they would feel more comfortable and have better ambient noise isolation. Easy setup and installation. All in all though a nice set of wireless headphones in my opinion."
R3S262FNPNVWRI,4,"I,m happy with it"
R2C70TWWEEX4EI,5,Ordered for a hard of hearing person for watching TV at my house.  Worked better for him than a device he was using that worked through his hearing aid.  Worked so well that he ordered 2 more for his TV's at home.
R300FWAE6PFAV3,4,works well.  can be a bit tricky getting the right channel\frequency.
R1BE4TD7V84DC9,3,"I haven't checked out these headphones yet but will probably purchase them. For that reason, I only put 3 stars to get the attention of would be buyers who read the negative comment about hissing noises.  I do want to make a comment to those that mentioned a hiss in the audio at quiet passages.  The trick there is, and I'm assuming you are using the phone jack output on your receiver, when you hear a hiss, turn down your receiver's volume control until the hiss is gone, then use your volume control on the headset to give yourself the desired volume.  I hope this helps."
R1FQYEAUN69FEV,5,"These headphones are light and they sounds fantastic. I am a longtime fan of Sennheiser and this set was no disappointment! They sound excellent for movies AND music. They are so light and comfortable, it's easy to forget you're wearing headphones. The bass is strong without being muddy while the highs are crisp. Excellent headphones for this price range"
RFDQ1U7YL7OOK,5,"There are two lights, one for charging and the other for being connected to a device. The sound is good, but don't expect it to sound as good as a Sony MDR-7506 which has a cable."
R3HJJRSRBRMX84,2,I brought four of these headphones and tonight the second one quit working.  It is the base which is not working on this one.  Amazon replaced the first headphone but now the second one is 3 months old and out of replacement time.  These are not the best of headphones ....too many problems .I will never get another one of these.
R1MHMZU2RV9S9U,5,I love Seinheiser products and this one is great.  I also have the older RS 170 which is better sound than the 120.  The 120 does work with the RS 170 which is awesome.
R2KSMWF67DFUUN,5,"I tried headphones from several of the stores in my area...Walmart, Radio Shack and Best Buy.  None of them worked properly.  The Sennheiser RS 120 does.  I can hear clearly and the volume can be set to my liking.  Did I mention that I have hearing aids?  I do not need my hearing aids when listening to TV through the Sennheiser.  Very, Very satisfied."
R2SKFHIYR3SKP7,5,A must have! works great and good quality.  watch TV while my wife takes a nap or goes to sleep early.
R3J4OLM88KSFE8,2,"I'm a huge sennheiser fan, and have several of their wired headphones - with my go-to being the HD-518's.<br /><br />I had this set for less than 4 hours before resigning them to the closet and going back to wired.  The hissing / static is outrageous.  I felt like I was transported back to my early 80's walkman headphones.  It's bad.  I could use a hundred adjectives but the point remains the same.  They're just bad.<br /><br />If you ever had a car with a manual dial tuner (the kind with the big red plastic piece indicating somewhere about where you're tuned), then you'll have an idea of what these sound like.  I still have them.  I don't want them - but I ignorantly destroyed their box before I got to turn up the volume.  In the next month, these will be either trashed or donated to Goodwill.  Do not want."
R10ZK2NMA2ARME,5,These are great and I would recommend them to anyone.
R1AK4RBYNSG4M4,5,"These still work to this day. I was going to rate them at 4, since I couldn't shake the static when they were near monitors. There isn't any static when plugged into the TV, so it seemed unfair to knock off an entire star just for a small situation."
RM01BJCFFKUHY,5,"This is the third set of RS120's I have purchased; 1st set for me, 2nd set for my father, 3rd set for my wife.  They sound great, and the three channel feature is good for multiple TV's in the same house."
R3PHGZJ0WDMYUR,5,"Great!  Solved the loud TV problem in our small retirement house.  Easy to set up,  good quaity all around, good range, performed like they were supposed to.  Loved the recharging station!"
R2F9VPNT652PH2,5,This a great product and the shipping was fast. Everything about it is super. The range and clarity are excellent.
R22T3AF8C7071D,2,"I got these to practice my bass without getting evicted from my apartment. When--and if--they work, fine...but tuning them is really tricky; volume lags; they seem to have stopped recharging spontaneously (go figure) and, just basically, they're a pain. Not for use around a strong electronic gizmo--like a bass amp--altogether not worth the $$."
R3FKQ2HX3QIKI7,5,"Excellent product, top notch 3D sound effect. I have got three at home."
R3JG9KJ6Z1VVEL,3,"I returned this item as they arent truly for tablet use, i was later informed."
R1FWSGPB2DXRI7,4,everything ok except I get feedback from my sound bar
R2KKRCX072FP10,4,It is a very good  product which adds very much to my enjoying various programs without disturbing anyone.
RYFZRSUQCRYVS,3,ok
R2PGRH6KP8FHOK,4,Great for my hard of hearing Mom. Would be a 5 except for need to tune to the receiver. We will buy 2 more for in laws due to outstanding price point. Great sound quality. Comfortable.
R3OTZLNKD2H2N0,5,"My wife just said we should have bought these years ago.  Set up was super easy, they worked with no issues and she likes the comfort of the ear pads.  We had a pair of IR headphones that never had decent sound and if you moved your head the wrong way the sound disappeared.  These RF headphones are so much better."
RZFIOM78UKPZP,1,"The Sennheiser RS120 headset was bought to use for TV as advertised;  I have a hearing problem that includes not understanding  some sounds.  RS120 clearly helped very much when it was working.  But there are serious problems.<br /><br />The reception stops and a very loud hiss comes on immediately and automatically -- at will as far as I can tell.  It stays that way until I remove the headset (the hiss is hard on the ears) and fiddle around enough to get sound back.<br /><br />I tried these on two occasions of about 20 minutes each one evening, and never got more than 3 or 4 minutes between hisses.  The hiss is louder than the sound it replaces.  In all cases I was in line of sight of the transmitter and within ten feet of it.  Touching the controls also brought on hissing on occasion. A cell phone ring 30 feet away caused loud interference but did not cause a hiss.<br /><br />Frankly, the set I had was not useable; it was returned (thank you, Amazon) and a Bose set purchased.  Obviously I was disappointed with the RS120 because it didn’t do the job, but also because this model has apparently been around quite a while and still has problems like this."
R2JKYLG6EOECIV,2,"Second set of headphones we've had to return to Sennheiser.  My previous ones just stopped working.  I set them back and they did replace them (with new ones).  Thank you.  NOW, after owning these 1 yr. 3 months, there's cracking noise when listening to them.  Tried various channels - and nothing seems to work.  Sending back to [hopefully] get a new pair that works properly.  Paying $92 for a set of wireless headphones - only one person (adult person) using them in the household, this should not happen.  It would be a good product if it worked the way it's supposed to.  They do however, have a 24 month warranty.  Again - hope to get a new pair that works properly."
R3T1R6KOTMN9VF,5,"We have owned two sets of these headphones for 4 years now and use them both every day - one set for my husband and one set for me.  I have difficulty sleeping and watch tv off and on almost all night. My husband has hearing problems and these headphones allow him to listen comfortably with the sound up as loud as he needs it to be.  The sound is clear on both sets.  We have had to replace the batteries, just last year.  These headphones are one of the best purchases we have made."
R203GICISHFKRM,5,works great
R396ZVFBJ2PTFV,5,"I got these for my dad, so he can hear the TV better, they work great, and the neighbors are thankful.."
R2P4VSOJLD2SRT,4,"I bought these headphones to replace a wired pair that attached to our Roku remote.  The wired pair used 2 AA batteries and they had to be replaced about once a week.  I was spending way too much on batteries.  I use headphones while watching TV at night so as to not disturb my husband when he falls asleep.  The wired ones were a bother when I wanted to change position and had to manipulate the wire.  The Sennheiser headphones work great as far as getting rid of the wire and eliminating the need to change batteries all the time.  The charger is very easy to use.  Just place the headset on it and forget it until the next time you need the headphones. Then just lift it off the charger and it's good to go.  I've been using it for several months and the rechargeable batteries have not gone dead.<br /><br />The only con is they are not really good if you are laying on your side.  They are too bulky to lay on comfortably , and the volume and tuning control on the right side is easy to accidentally turn if you are laying on that side.  If you are sitting upright or laying on your back, there's no problem.  The sound quality is very good also."
R320721XBLLZ3C,4,Works well good sound quality. Charging station a little finiky to get head phones properly on charge.
RWUINOBQBUTEI,4,WORKS WELL BUT TIGHTNESS ON MY EARS IS A PROBLEM WHEN WATCHING TV FOR AN HOUR OR MORE.
R3F0DBXMBZRZQR,5,They work great for me I'm very happy with them
R3J95XMRR7J9OX,4,"These were purchased so that i can game and watch tv late at night.  My 5.1 system is quite boomy and these headphones allow me to game at a good volume worhout waking up everyone in my small ranch. Decent range and great vocals and mids, doesnt handle real bass heavy music well.  Voices match the tv.  On the downside if you lose your signal you will get the loud hiss sound in your ears.  I also remove them occasionally because of my ears getting warm.  They also kill the ambient noise in the house and i have to remove from an ear to hear people talk.  Very happy with my purchase though."
R1D8XVTXYRJZGS,4,Great headphones but buttons are too close together!
R3AHJ5MCKBKA5Q,3,"It has been working beautifully.  However, the original was defective (no sound in one earphone), and it was a hassle to get it replaced, but the replacement has been working perfectly for over a year now."
R2XZF2VQRMFDNC,5,Simple to set up.  Excellent sound and comfortable fit.
R1524P2MTU23G6,3,"I can't seem to tune it in to where there is no background 'hissing' noise. It's not really loud, but it's definitely annoying. Depending on what I'm watching, sometimes I don't hear it. Has to be a rambunctious movie for that though. If it's a quiet scene, it's very apparent."
RSYDF9XCFYTYX,5,"This is one of the best things I could have purchased, I can hear what people are saying while watching TV, Movies, etc. It also makes the family happy knowing I no longer need the volume set to extra high."
R1ZP1TMOZ3S02F,5,"I was a little leary about buying refurbished, but these are like new and are really good headphones."
R29RK666KQT4OP,1,"I had very high hopes for this product. It seemed a great price and was received as expected. Unfortunately, after two sets I'm done trying to make them work. The connector for the power unit (referred to as the &#34;mains&#34; in the item instruction) to the transmitter base is extremely difficult to get connected. Both times, I had it connected, the green indicator light showing it had power was on and then by the time I was done setting it up the rest of the way and had connected it to the TV the green light was off and could not be coerced into working again. Nothing in the instructions showed that the light would go out...I returned one set thinking that it may be defective but the second set did the same thing. Three of us tried to make it work unsuccessfully. Time to try another brand."
R3RNE6JMM4E2OV,5,I bought the headphones for my 96 year old dad. He has them on each time I visit him so they must be comfortable.
R30AJAIQHAVPL,3,"I got these to take with me on cruises so when I share a cabin with someone who likes to watch TV, they could use the headphones and not disturb my reading. They work fairly well but the base is very large and shaped such that they are difficult to pack and one of the pads came off of the earphones."
R1J6OO78HO05FI,5,Extremely happy. But it had to be hooked up to my cable box NOT the tv since I have cable. Works like a dream.
R23P63UD3OF54I,5,I use this every evening after my husband goes to bed.  Works great. Sound is very clear and batteries recharge every day.  Love it.
R2DX0YCBXZY09L,4,"After using for 12 months I can say it has functioned very good, the only problem is that the tuning dial is very susceptible to be inadvertently moved, as in if your head is resting on a chair cushion or pillow and you turn your head to the right it will go out of tune.<br />Not a big issue, but annoying"
R9AQHKIZDAZBD,5,Work great-no problems.
R3IJNSX3OCNJW8,5,"I use mine all the time to watch movies, weekly series and the news.  I don't miss too many words anymore.  Every now and then I don't hear or understand what was said.  Overall I am very pleased with these headphones."
R1FLDLOAFT5FA8,5,Excellent sound quality.  Would buy again.
R2E20GBU4XFCIL,5,Excellent product!
R1L3L5LSAXF7MS,4,"Great headphone, really makes the television sound clear. I bought these because my hearing is not as good as it used to be, (too much loud music, and being in the construction trade did not help). I could not turn the volume of the TV up loud enough to hear everything without it being too loud for everybody else. These completely corrected that! The sound is very clear, I hear details that I could never hear without them. Listening to basketball games is amazing! All of the talk on the side of the court comes through clearly. Action movies feel like the sound is all around you, I almost feel like they have surround sound instead of just stereo.<br />Now my wife likes to use them to hear all of the detail in her music shows like American Idol and The Voice, you really can hear a difference, especially with the poor TV speakers that most sets have now. They have great range, I have walked over 150 feet from the transmitter and still had a perfectly good signal.<br />Cons: They fit on the ear, not over the ear. They do not push too hard, but if you move your head around, or look down, they can slide around on your head, or fall off. I would rather have that than have them too tight, that would limit the time that they would be comfortable to wear.<br />Also, the tuning dial is located in a position that makes it too easy to accidentally bump, causing the volume to drop, or cut out entirely, or turn to just static. They could have made a hidden dial, as it does not need to be accessed very often, if at all, once it is set up. There is some occasional clicking noise, maybe from other device interference, but this is not a major problem.<br />I found that the best way to hook up the headphones was to the audio RCA outputs on my TV, other locations, like at the satellite receiver, picked up the delay between the satellite and the TV as a slight echo between the TV speakers and the headphones.<br />Another design flaw, (in my opinion), is that the transmitter will shut itself off it it does not get a signal for about 4 or 5 minutes. This means that if you pause the playback, (for example), for more than 4 or 5 minutes the transmitter shuts off and you will just hear static, at whatever volume level that you were listening too. It seems like they could have made the headphones shut off if they did not have a signal, but who knows.<br />Overall, I love these headphones."
R2LVBMT2511QUP,5,This works great.  The sound is very good and you can move around in your house and still hear everything without getting static.
R2GUMS4C4QWRAN,5,Just what I needed not to disturb my wife when she goes to bed.
R2UVNTS1WH88U4,4,Makes a world of difference when watching TV. Sound goes directly in the ear and cuts out the outside noise.
R1WKPPPQA7EBG1,1,"This is my 2nd set and they have the same problem as the first set  of shutting down and blowing out an ear drum. If this is common I will return the second set, if not I love the unit and will try for a third time.<br /><br />jim"
R3LZO7QRD4JM0M,5,BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON.  NOW I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR TWO TVS GOING AT ONCE.  He likes it because he can hear the dialogue better and the background sound doesn't overwhelm the dialogue.
R1R38A3GD25T9O,5,"They work really well.  Nicely made, great sound.  Replaced my mom's old &#34;TV Ears&#34; with this much nicer unit."
RVW3DEFYPYZX9,5,easy to set up .sounds good
R12009FXEX62EG,5,Bought these for my dad and he loves them.
R37TGHCYK5K9X8,5,"THese deliver exactly what I expect from Sennheiser name..I have been using them with the TV to block out neighbors' noise that caused me to keep increasing volume. The headphones are comfortable the the controls are really easy to use, very convenient.<br />The sound is great, much better listening to TV this way than through the TV speakers themselves."
R3P8IN56BAH0Z5,5,"Fabulous sound. I bought these to use at work (I am a medical transcriptionist), but apparently our mostly metal cubicle walls provide too much interference to the signal. So that was a disappointment, but when I set them up at home and got the signal tuned in properly, the sound was awesome. Anyone who's used cordless headphones will know about the faint hiss and the auto shut-off feature - I will say that other cordless headphones I have used have just gone silent, and have not given the blast of static that these do when they switch off. But it's a very small complaint, not even worth half a star."
R1QNN5NX30H00D,5,They fit good and the sound is excellent.  Easy to charge and adjustments are easy to make.
R3LF56F9DUJU5O,3,"Great item that allows me to listen to the stereo or TV without bothering other people.  No problems using it around the house or outside in the yard.  My one complaint is I sometimes have to keep tuning it and it is subject to interference (e.g., I get static interference when my wife uses her waterpik)."
R14NBSR23ELGRW,4,"UPDATE: Okay, I'm very embarrassed now.  After suffering through poor, staticky connections for several years with these headsets, and almost getting ready to replace them, I have finally discovered that you can choose between three wireless channels.  Switching to a different channel resolved nearly all my static issues, and the sound quality is now great.  However, it's almost a crime that Sennheiser made the channel selector switch so tiny.  It's almost invisible.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: No matter where I use these headsets, they fade in and out when I nod my head towards and away from the receiver, even from two feet away.  Very underwhelmed."
R3EC416NSTFKVQ,4,sound is good hard to keep on head
R2O8I0AJ5OM05,2,I like the way they recharge.  So easy to place on the stand.  I don't like the way they fit on my head.  They fall off whenever I move.  Also the ear pieces don't fit well and are a little on the hard side.  I hope to return these and go back to the Sony RF985.  Sennheiser has such a good reputation in the music industry so I had high hopes for these.  The sound quality is fine and being able to tune to different channels is nice. Hope they work well for others.  I am disappointed .
R2IYKXC09WW7VP,5,excellent
R15ALG70RN3VJG,3,"At first when delivered I thought I was very happy with them.  Upon using them (I wear glasses) I find that they get very uncomfortable after a short time.  Also with these (or probably any others) there is no laying down and watching tv.  Very uncomfortable.  Also when charging, for some reason, I have to put something on top of them to weight them down to connect.  While I like them at times I'm sorry I bought them."
R5W897FOSYIN5,5,Easy set-up and worked perfectly.  Now the volume needed for my wife doesn't keep the rest of us out of the same room.  And the range allows her to roam around and not miss any dialog.
R2H1YJQW1HRZDW,5,These are very good.  It is my second pair.  The older one quit holding a charge.  Probably just needed new rechargeable batteries.
R1N1XIIGVOGAJ9,1,would not work with my TV
R2LQ98I0WWQU2B,5,Very pleased!
R2QZFTSANVMR8E,1,These are analog and won't work on anything digital without a $50 adapter.
R8HKTE3WZ6EVK,3,The headphones work great with the TV but do not stay on my head. If I look down or sneeze they fall right off. Really design.
R1KPYSFY30559S,5,great product
RQIINEFSIKD70,5,Constant usage... No issues
R1RYLYALLBDGKP,5,Just what I wanted would deal with again.
R1YXD7OZ46OFCC,5,These head phones are great! When the volume needs to be lower for others than what I need I just put on my headphones and adjust the volume on them to the volume I need. The only time I have a problem is when someone wants to speak to me. Then I have to remove them.
R68542GCJRZN0,5,love it.
R1Y9AD2LWW7R8V,1,First headphone set had a dead left channel.  The replacement set had a dead charging station.  I will not be ordering a third set.
R11GRN2DNPARGS,5,Using this is like sitting in a movie theater - only better!!  Great high-quality surround sound!!
R258805U16JTFX,2,"too much hiss, and needing to play around with settings all the time, needs to be simpler"
R32UCGUNB1N2L8,1,"Erratic at best.  Read the other 1 star reviews about dropped signal, auto shutoff, and hideously painful loud static.  It is not worth the frustration of pausing your movie every 5 or 10 minutes to troubleshoot this issue!"
R33L8UUG4TEBZY,5,I have used this same headphones for many years but had  they began to present minor problems. I found these and they worked perfectly and I have been able to use the new ones interchangeably with the old ones.<br />And the price was right.<br />I am pleased with these.
RYXIJ4CZ19KVR,5,They arrived right on time and we are most pleased with them!
R2AL51RI6JRIX6,5,Works great has a few channels to pick from if there is interference from other items in the house.
R177GE5APEOT3Z,5,This product has performed better than expected.  Would purchase again.
R1OZBB44ZLSTRD,4,"This headpnone is connected to the rear of my Samsung tv. It works well with volume control on the headset and it is independent of the tv volume.  my wife can listen to the tv at her volume and her nearly deaf husband can still hear with the aid of these headphones.  The RF type device is far better than the bluetooth I was using, the range is much greater and the clarity is better than with the compressed files of bluetooth.  I have had one minor glitch which may or may not be the headset.  The volume seems to jump either louder or softer on occasion.  Not a deal breaker but worth noting."
R1WUBFWQCOOFBJ,5,"I received this wireless headset and proceeded to do the installation, which it was easy. I ordered this to install it to my western digital media player. I did not want to install it directly to the tv. I just use this when i watch movies on my WD. I was having trouble with loud noise and not being able to tune it. I was able to find out what the problem was and solve it. The problem was that i was using the video/audio line out of the media player and I used the Seinnheiser stereo to RCA adapter. I guess there is some noise or feedback between the line out and the adapter. I then use the adapter that comes with the WD media player. It is the adapter that has a video/audio thin plug on one end and three RCA male plugs on the other end. i bough two female-to-female adapters, since the RCA plugs on the Seinheiser are also males, and conected them together. I left the yellow video plug disconeted. This resolved the noise issue. I was able to tune the head set and it sounds excellent. Another thing that I didn't like was that the headset was On-ear. I don't like it. I contacted Seinnheiser and they were very helpful. They told me that i would be able to use the Over-ear pads from the HD 280 headphones. I just need to remove the foam pads from the plastic holder of the RS120 and carefully place the ear pads of the HD 280 on them. If they go on a little loose i can use a small piece of tape. I ordered them from the seinnheiser website for $27 with Shipping and tax included. I am happy with the sound quality and i am still under $100 for the system. Can't beat the price. Update! I received the over-ear pads I installed then with out much trouble. They looked like they were going to be too tight to fit over the plastic holder of the RS120, but they stretched. I used the back end of a small round spoon to help me install them. Similar to installing a bicycle tire. Fit one end first and the proceed to stretch out until it gos all around using the spoon handle. There are a couple of pieces of double sided tape underneath the original pads. Leave them in place to secure the new pads. Happy with the results. I will try to post pictures."
R1PXR37Y9Y9EDY,3,I keep loosing my connection and sound quality no very good
R3750HIRU0DDG4,5,Excellent
R1M8GPPNSWCP2O,5,They work great.  I have noticed a little bit of an echo.  I use them in my bedroom.  I am very happy with the range and the quality.
R93KHV0L2UIC5,5,The best you can use
R23SAKD5JCHXBL,5,Great product
R3EAL7PRPW2N6A,5,"I love these earphones. We bought our first pair from Amazon in 2011, so that I could watch/hear TV without disturbing my husband's sleep. We also used them while on the treadmill, so that the TV did not have to blare out loud enough to be heard over the noise of the treadmill. I picked up a spare pair of ear pad cushions, so that I could have a dry pair to use right after my husband used the treadmill. (The ear pad cushions are easy to change, but don't fall off easily.) The rechargeable battery has never failed, even though the headphones rest on my bedpost overnight because I'm too tired... or lazy, to return them to the recharging dock. Used 3 times a day, they've gotten a lot of use over these last 3.5 years.<br /><br />Now that we've moved the treadmill out of the bedroom, we just bought a second set of these Sennheiser headphones from Amazon for that room as well. These headphones have extremely high quality sound, which you can continue to hear through walls and floors, if you have to run downstairs to change a load of laundry. We highly recommend these."
R1WN105U6WP28Q,5,"These are my first wireless headphones, and they work great. They're not working with my newer HDTV, but I KNOW it's not the fault of this set, because they work perfectly with my older Sanyo HDTV. I'm very happy with them, I just need to get my Samsung to get with the program here. Easy to setup and tune in and use. I didn't realize when I bought them that they were 'on ear' and not 'over the ear', and I prefer over the ear, but that was entirely my mistake for not realizing that before I ordered them."
R2985C84OMID4H,5,This works well.  I ordered a second.
R3RROU8QJGMXHG,2,"Rarely do I take the time to write any reviews, but this time I felt a need to take the time for the sake of helping others.<br /><br />The Sennheiser RA120 RF Headphones do provide a decent sound, but not as good as the Sony DP-RF6500 earphones I own.  I purchased these as a back up set for when the Sony set was recharging.  The Sony pair are over the ear (with surround sound) and that helps to make them sound better.  The Sennheiser  do not have a snug fit (being an on the ear headphone) and tend to fall off quite easily.  That sung fit does help to hold in and create a more pleasurable sound.  I do like that they come with an adaptor that plugs into my computer so I can listen to the music I have programmed.  The Sony headset does not have this feature.  The Sennheiser  has both the on/off switches built into the headset and that feature is far better than the Sony switch that is located on the base station.  The Sennheiser do have a good range and are not a product without some nice touches overall.  Still, I will never buy another pair of these.<br /><br />I first purchased the RS120 On Ear headphones and needed to return them because the headset was bent and they needed to weighted down to force them to charge.  I assumed getting a new unbent set would resolve these issues.  I was wrong.  The replacement set arrived and for awhile they charged fine.  As time passed they too needed to be have pressure applied to keeps them charging.  The curved wire that the headset rests upon to charge is simply a poor design.  The headset itself is too lightweight to make contact in order for them them charge.  I was forced to use a plastic clamp to push them down enough to touch the charging wire.  Now this is no longer working correctly because I can no longer get a full 18 hour charge out of them.  At best I now get only a two hours charge at a time.<br /><br />Unlike the first set I am no longer within the time frame to send them back. I have exceeded the send back time by 13 days.  I now have to live with the bad choice I made to save a few dollars and pick the one with the poor design.  When I needed to clamp the second set down for the first time I should have sent them back then and stayed with the Sony I knew sounded and fit better.  I know that I will soon be replacing these with a better set.<br /><br />I will look for a set that has the two features the Sennheiser does have.  The next set will have an adaptor to plug the headset into.  Also the HEADSET WILL HAVE BOTH the on and off switches located on them so I will not get settled into my recliner, only to have to get up and turn on the base station.  I advise anyone that has taken the time to read this far into my review to think about these features before buying any brand of headsets."
R128QJP08VAA0Q,5,FANTASTIC!
R2VF9OZZYCM8E0,5,"i'm an idiot and these are for a TV, not to use with your laptop. oops. woulda been great if i had a tv. also, they were really really big on me. I have a pretty standard size head for a woman. would fit a dude much better."
R17149RLY22K06,3,Plugged directly into TV but only works when the DVD player is used.
R31FT7AYE3EBGE,5,Best headset ever... for the money.
R3RBDPR8CMMJB9,4,For the money  the equipment is satisfactory
R26U81SCUJJP7D,4,works great
R3J59BHU3SFXEG,4,Happy with the product and the ordering process.
R1WU78U3XD0GTW,1,"I am quite disappointed in these headphones, but there is no option to contact the seller. The static in the left phone is so bad that I cannot stand to have it on my ear. The right one works okay, but being able to use only one side makes the set virtually useless. I think that if they worked properly I might like them, but at this point would have to say that I would not recommend them nor would I buy again.  Update... The headphones have only gotten worse. I haven't tried to use them for two weeks, and when I put them on this evening the static in the left phone is horrible. Now in addition to the original issue, the base unit goes on and off constantly. When it goes off the noise in the right phone (which is the only one I can use) is so loud that it nearly takes my head off. I am extremely dissatisfied with these headphones. When I went to my account to see what I needed to do to send them back, I discovered that they have only a 30 day return policy and still no option top contact the seller. Apparently I bought a defective set of headphones, and now I'm stuck with them."
R71MSCVGVR4FU,4,Works good here
R3QQQAAV7GH65T,3,Not that comfortable
R2PV3AJP38Q4S0,5,Arrived in excellent condition. Fast delivery. As advertised.
R2M39Z9CPEW0B2,2,COULD NOT GET TO WORK EVEN AFTER TRYING MANY AUDIO CONNECTIONS AND EARHONE  SETTINGS ALL I EVER GOT WAS ALOT OF STATIC!!!! DON'T BUY.
R3PS1RPVLXDWGG,1,Base will not stay on. unable to use.
R2A9FKKLI1O25Z,1,Charger was defective ... returned for refund
REZ02FOQKPFWU,5,Excelente deal. Highly recommended
RJ8PCN0VA1B16,2,"The radio frequency dial (how you pair up these headphones, like an old boombox dialing into an FM station) is at the bottom right can. Turn your head slightly with a collared shirt on, and you'll turn the dial! Then your ears will be assaulted with extremely loud static. But that's not the only way to get extremely loud static! If you don't have music playing for a minute, say while you're trying to decide what movie to stream, it will, you guessed it, cut to static! Also expect some low level hissing that is hard to get rid of, like some kind of ground interference. Playing with the dial helps. Just don't turn your head once you get it right.  It also has unintuitive, annoying design elements. For example, if you plug in the power to the back of the charging base, (which for some reason doesn't sit flush with the connector, it sits out about an 1/8th of an inch, like you haven't pushed it in all the way,) the lights on the base don't turn on. Then you try and push on that connector and still, nothing happens. Then you try another power strip, still no lights come on. Finally, I figured out you have to have the headset on the charging base, for the unit to indicated it has any power.  Added annoyance, I returned it via USPS in the box it came in and the return shipping was $9. They also asked if it was an Amazon return, not sure why, maybe they charge more."
R3GGAO9Z1UMLBH,5,Great product.  Very helpful service.
ROL88FERSKAX,5,Ignore the naysayers who tell you that getting these sends the wrong message to your spouse/partner/lover/roommate.  All the BS stops when you plug them in.  Want to sleep while your wife watches Bravo? BOOM!  Wife wants to sleep while you watch How It's Made? THAT JUST HAPPENED!  Both of you want to sleep while that fat purple dinosaur belts out some pedantic ditty about feelings? YES YOU CAN DO IT!
R2S9O1UITP4BN0,5,"Excellent wireless headphones, does exactly what I need it to do.  I use them every night when watching TV while my wife is sleeping.  The sound quality is excellent...which makes watching TV even more enjoyable.  I researched various models of wireless headphones, but I'm glad I purchased the Sennheiser RS120.  Would definitely buy them again."
R19H2C9D5V3JO3,5,"Working very well for me, I hear very sound now"
R1594RV7WU01VO,2,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM THROUGH AMAZON ON MARCH 16 2014. iT HAS NOW STOPPED WORKING EVEN THOUGH i HAVE INSERTED NEW BATTERIES. THERE IS NO SOUND AT ALL FROM THE EARPHONES WHEN THE TV IS ON NOR DOES IT APPEAR TO BE CHARGING - NO RED LIGHT COMES ON WHEN THE PHONES ARE PUT ON THE CHARGER.<br /><br />AS I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A TWO YEAR WARRANTY. WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
RXHI9YX1XIJDR,5,Hi---  Undeniably  -- the finest audio air-borne aid offered for public use. I have purchased two complete sets my use and for family use.  Audio quality is superb  on this model and the units are a blessing for wireless convenience. -- EFD
R1UFOS5EM2EMHO,1,hard to tune - keeps producing screeching noises.
RIULEUVTA04MV,3,"The sound is great!  They slip off my head when I bend over even a little.  Also, an interruption in the signal causes sudden very loud static.  It is a very huge help to my wife who is sensitive to noise such as the tv being too loud."
R30D4WWNKO6IWG,5,"They have worked great! Clear sound, nice range in volume."
R3PJ9RY3625TCY,1,Impossible to set up and we returned it immediately for a less expensive and better product.
R3H28S9Q352O0W,5,Love my new head phones. Should have bought them years ago:)
R26BNS94TRD1QP,4,Little figuring to get set up==but great sound.  Hear broader range of sound when wearing then when just listening to the TV--and lets others sleep.
R4CJQUDNF5UNG,1,"never could get this thing to work, spent hours reading instructions, which by the way are none existent. purchased because of other peoples reviews but was not pleased"
RIYY9TP0HMOE6,5,"amazing product  don't know how I did without it.  Do not need closed captioning any more which used to block out important parts of the screen.  Instructions are not very clear.  There is a switch(albeit very small) on the bottom of the charging stand with 3 positions.  When I was listening on the first night of set up I heard annoying hissing and cracking.  I read some of the reviews again, which are very helpful with setting up hints, and learned about the switch mentioned above.  What a difference.  The sound is amazing.  I am even able to tune  in any tv in my house and watch the picture from a tv in my living room while the headphone set up is in my great room.  I thought I would have to purchase another unit.  I can do the same in my bedroom which is through a cement wall.  The distance this wireless sound reached is very, very far, and the brochure states about 300 feet.  You can even listen to music from your tv channels and walk anywhere in the house, and I have a large house.  The only downside is that it is difficult to hear others speaking to you when the headphones are on. but since you have a hearing problem anyway, you probably would not hear anyone without the headphones on!!!!"
R3VMZT151IZCAO,5,Great sound quality. Simple setup. Maximum comfort
R171I8Z3SBWH7T,5,Easy set up. Good tv headphones and works on phone and stereo
RUI8KQ8DD0736,5,"Enjoying the headphones without having to raise the volume and bothering others in the room who are chatting more than viewing tv.  Easy to set up, clear reception anywhere in the home and can walk away from the tv and continue to maintain connection with whatever I was viewing."
RM3ZDATD5SJYO,5,"Excellent quality, you get what you pay for..."
R1VRXHDZHBUY1S,5,Very light and functions well. Batteries did not hold up and had to replace very pleased. Might buy another one for home as this is in Fl. condo
R3LROV4ZYTZFH,5,I am very pleased with the sound quality.
R1QKYT2DOS7RTL,4,Excellent unit. Always replace unit on charging stand since sound quality will degrade when the charge level gets low. Has two volume adjustment methods to modify sound to your hearing preferences.
R22A88ZWYXRG2M,5,They work great. Very light weight and comfortable.
R2EG9PKMMZBHYC,4,"I have a hearing problem simply brought on by age. These Wireless headphones were recommended to me and they simply are terrific. I no longer have to have the TV sound up high, can use these headphones with or without the mute button on the TV and in the very early mornings I can now watch the news without disturbing anyone else in the house. Great product."
R3N71AGCXSCQIP,5,Great set of head phones.
R3FQ0EBBO2MSVX,1,overpriced....and flawed...didnt; last a month
R3HR4Z1CP6Y5DE,2,"Can not find a workable channel during daytime hours. It is on a stand right under my Samsung television.  I understand some televisions can cause tuning problems.  I can tune it at any other time. Other than that, It works fine."
R3ICJPSHLIG080,3,Sound stopped working in one side after about a year.
RX3L1O8U4DMNQ,5,"This was purchased for my Mother, who is not very tech savvy. She loves it."
R21YLMKV6BERIX,5,Does very well  you have to adjust it to get  it just right but once you do it works perfectly up to 200+ ft
RY22QQG60NK7T,5,"I bought this for my husband,  as a gift.  After we set the head phones up they worked for about 2 weeks.  then they would periodically brake sound to very loud static.  There were not consistent at providing quality sound.  I would not purchase them again.  I only bought this brand because two of my extended family members had them and theirs worked great. Of course we cant return them because the 30 day return window has closed now. One dis-satisfied customer."
R2WMK6W44H08FB,4,Works very well.  Range is far.
RJPLANCQ9E7MP,5,"Works fantastic!  I can walk all over the house and hear clearly.  That includes upstairs, downstairs and the other end of the house!!"
R29QKCJ3QJOLLQ,5,I gave the wireless headphones to my husband.  He has thoroughly enjoyed using it and can hear the television programs much clearer.
RIL405DFC9MS6,5,This is a very good unit. Also my second purchase of this item.
R35WC8HDC0YBS1,5,"Gift for wife, and she loves them. Plus now I don't have to listen to her stupid TV shows..."
R26QFVWPM6B2K9,5,These were purchased for my 80 year old father in-law.  He LOVES them and my mother in-law loves the fact that she doesn't have to hear the TV with the sound up really high!!!  He says the sound is great!
R23CZ3NDE3XMAT,5,Clear sound...easy setup
R1JIAHBRDZUA6B,5,These were purchased for my husband to watch TV with and he loves them. They are comfortable and the charge last a long time. He loves them....
R38Z0WCX6TMVRN,5,"I bought this for my wife. I had purchased another brand prior to this, it really stunk, and the price wasn't cheap. Since receiving the Sennheiser, wireless she is absoluty thrilled. They are great and the price was well within my budget. I can recommend this brand without any doubt. A great buy."
R2X3CGQK70XNYU,5,Good full bodied surround sound.  I love it
R3FWQB9YB5XCYI,4,"I received these headphones as a Christmas gift.  My husband goes to bed early at 8:00 PM to wake up at 4:00 AM for work everyday.  Me, on the other-hand, I'm a night person.  I like to stay up and watch TV until I fall asleep; so he bought me these headphones so I can watch TV while he sleeps.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good sound<br />- Stays charged for a long amount of time<br />- Pretty quiet, my husband can't hear a thing while he's sleeping<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's comfortable to wear - but can get a little heavy if worn for a long period of time<br />- It's not very comfortable to wear if you're lying down on a pillow<br />- If there is no sound coming from the TV, a loud static noise will appear and hurt your ears<br /><br />I do like these headphone as it does serve the intended purpose in which it was bought for."
RAPW8BEHFPT7S,5,"I love this. I was worried about spending so much on headphones but I can honestly say this was a brilliant investment to make. Life is so much easier, and the design is brilliant. Plus, rechargeable everything. I could not have asked for anything more. So happy for this."
R38L9F60LNOZA6,1,The tuner doesn't tune in the sound from the channel on the TV.
R2MC9BCDVEI0HP,5,"Love my headphone....sure saved arguments between me & husband!  We like to watch different programs, so I can watch mine without him hearing a word.  Also, I never realized I was missing out on the background music until I put the headphones on....great sound."
R3SS7NU9ZY34YV,5,Works great. The hard of hearing can set the volume where he wants it without blasting the rest of us out.  We liked them so much we bought two more for other areas of the house.
R35IJ7VSN7FVG7,2,Big and clumsy.  Too much so for bedroom TV use.  Probably OK for the living room or den.
R1QIJKS09MYU2V,1,"I would not recommend these headphones at all.  They are hard to tune in to each different channel you watch and I have only had them for two months and they completely stopped working.  Went and bought a pair of Sony headphones.  Save your money, don't buy these."
R3ES0VICSS54DW,4,"Good product but setup is a bit odd. After an hour I got it working. Works great if you're up late at night watching TV and don't want to disturb others. SQ is also great and is expected from such a highly-reputable brand. Tip: if you get a hissing noise, just play around with the Tune dial until you feel it's right for you."
R3LD749ZO55TL2,5,Very good product.  Easy to hook up and comfortable to use.  Great sound.
R2QF749RCDFH6Z,1,"Had to send the first set back, but the second set (a gift for parents that are hard of hearing) lasted about 6 months so bought two more to be used on different TVs in the house. All three are now unusable. Even when they worked, loss of signal was a huge issue. When audio is not present (such as breaks in the content or pausing) the headphone broadcasts loud static that is audible by others in the room, and hurts the ears of the person wearing them. One of the units does not get power. This one lasted about 1 month. We are now switching to a wired solution for my parents and recommend the same to anyone looking at these headphone until they address the many faults with these headphone. I highly recommend everyone look at the reviews. Sort the reviews by date. It appears that the older versions of these headphones were better."
ROOHBWU36FLGE,5,Love it well worth the $$$. Use it for t.v. at night when family sleeps and I want to watch a show. Very comfortable. Denise m
R29DOYD68X5PCK,5,Awesome
R3UC0AP5E7XZZN,5,"Just what everyone needs. Works great and reasonably priced, and easy to operate."
RPQB0M3M5SL3W,5,"Works great, I can walk thru whole house w/o interference. (about 200 ft)"
R1HPSV2GFK2UBJ,4,"OUR USE:  Watching TV, gaming, Just Dance (dancing).<br /><br />GENERAL REVIEW:  These headphones are excellent.  I would give them five stars except that there is always a little feedback and the sound is not completely perfect.  I use these for doing Just Dance whenever I might be disturbing sleepers otherwise and watching a show I want to watch without disturbing other family members.  My kids have used them just for watching TV and also playing video games.<br /><br />PROS:  They charge wirelessly.  They are worn wirelessly.  You do not have to have line-of-sight in order to hear, we can walk out of the room and into other parts of our house and they still work.  The sound is relatively clear.  There are many channels that you can use to try to get the best signal.<br /><br />CONS:  The placement of the volume control dial and the radio frequency tuning are on the same ear and one above the other.  I have frequently untuned my headset while trying to adjust my volume.  The sound is never perfect, there is always just a little bit of feedback or noise of some sort."
R31OAL64QP96K7,2,"They will Work part of the time, then they will lose power and just have static. I can't  watch a full tv show and hear with them. That was my main reason for ordering  the earphones. I need suggestions, or I have wasted my money."
RGYEPKAA2J7WP,5,"Work just fine. Buttons on headset are too close together, you can easily change the headset channel when you are trying to turn the volume up or down."
R268AFS8A8NOP5,5,The wireless headphones work better than I expected.  The sound is of good quality as is the construction of the headset.  I am happy with the results
RTKZ4TQK3HG0O,1,"this really is a piece of crap. It never worked right, lots of static. Now, only 3 months old, it does not work at all. The website says customer help 24/7 but when I called I got a recording that customer service was closed!"
R1EF6NHWKD3BGE,5,"Nice....use them every night.  Sound is solid.  Use them on a 24&#34; samsung TV,,,with no sound control problems.  TV audio and headphone sound controls are independent."
RQKTQ6F917329,4,"I bought these headphones to replace the TV Ears we've had for years, which finally gave out - weak support arms.<br /><br />The Sennheiser HDR120 HiFi Wireless headphones work great - you don't have to be in the same room, or even in the house - I've listened from the back yard, or while checking the mail out front. I didn't think I was an audiophile, but I can hear a slight &#34;hiss&#34;, which is why I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />The puzzling thing is about the way Amazon says the &#34;Frequently Ordered Together&#34; items. These will NOT connect to the digital output of the TV, only the analog output so ordering the digital cable is NOT necessary."
R2GZJ0KPMCCBOC,5,gift
R618G9SGDF407,5,These headphones work very well. The sound is great and the range is amazing. The fit is not perfect but very manageable. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
R3VORLIB8OCY6N,5,yes always the best  excellent
R1155VS28I1J7T,3,Standard
R3OVHSVW9SSAE8,5,"This is a great product. Excellent sound and easy to set up. One key, make sure your TV sound is higher than normal, then adjust volume on the headset. Simple product and good quality. Only downside is more wires to hide for the base station, but I was able to his them."
R1EC6CQBKCZWOH,4,"Excellent for the price. Small amount of ambient noise still gets through, but the convenience of wireless and the quality of sound is great"
R3U9ARF2IH5ZYZ,4,"Much improved over previous model, longer range, clearer sound"
R3GSUUI71XF5ZJ,3,"The sound is fantastic, but the frequency adjustment is tricky and not very accurate. I'd recommend headphones that either have a dedicated frequency or pre-set frequencies."
R7TS0SK0SIPD2,4,Great headphones for the price.
R28S6T1UXTBA24,5,They are wonderful.  I gave them to my husband on Valentine's Day.  He had the TV ears previously.  They stopped working and the ear cushions they give you (plus the ones we ordered extra) were constantly falling out or staying in his ears.  He loves the earphones and could not be happier.  They met all my expectations.
RMCPLOA1OBBP6,4,I use them everyday. Such an improvement in my life when watching tv.
RCEJI366RGB0E,5,Very good product! I love it
R2XJ553XQ3G2R5,4,"Build quality is OK, sound quality is OK, but it works as advertised and the charging base is well designed."
RG9RJMU1EQUMQ,5,"Better than I imagined. I have a slight hearing problem and now I can hear TV sounds clearly. Couldn't be happier. I've never written a review before, but these earphones are so good, I had to write."
R10N1915IK5IFZ,5,"This works so well; I use it in the office when I'm working out in the early mornings on the elliptical machine. The rest of the house is not disturbed, and when/if I or husband want to watch TV in the bedroom, these bad boys go on, and the other can concentrate/sleep. No regrets, and wonderful sound. Easy to install and use."
R1GDHRMDF93FJ1,5,"Arrived quickly, as described.  Great range and sound. One piece of advice would be to buy name brand rechargable AA batteries.  They come with off brand, but hey, at least the batteries were included."
R2FR8AJUNS2K2U,5,Excellent quality and great sound. Just what I was looking for.
R3TMYG8H8W5PTI,1,"Hi ghere, my order details are Order date<br />Feb 10, 2015<br />Order #<br />102-3243340-1130628<br />Order total<br />$69.99 (1 item)<br />I sent it out to China  to my friend as a gift, he just receive it  and when he tried to use it , he found the charger doesn't work, do you have warranty for this item out of America ? That a pity ."
R2RCEZ44S3EGTV,4,I bought them as a gift for my husband and he says when he bends down they slip off his head. The sound is really good.
R30259L3OWIAOB,5,"We had this headset for about 3years now, excellent sound and comfort."
R2ZOL5MP2ZRU5A,5,"Yes, everything I needed to move around the house while listening to program sound."
R17PJ7ZEAY5BT9,4,sound quality is awesome and the charging setup is flawless. My only complaint is they fall off my head easily after using them a bunch they lose their grip.
R2LSJRB570K8HB,5,Very happy with the head phone
RR1POUVA8ECSA,5,"Itis wonderful. Sound goes through walls and It goes beyond 100+ feet., out doors.  I highly recommend it."
R2RDRSI9D4FY7M,1,weren't worth having
R3EWJ7APSSDBYP,4,THEY WORK WELL BUT DON'T STAY ON YOUR HEAD IF YOU MOVE AROUND. THE EAR MUFFS ARE TO SMOOTH TO GRIP YOUR EAR AND SLIDE OFF IF YOU DON;T SIT STILL. NOW I HEAR TV SOUNDS I WOULD OF NOT HEARD WITHOUT. I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH
R1NSZ6T51ZAYH9,5,"Love these headphones! My daughter is using them up in the game room so we don't have interfering TV's. She forgot a couple of times to charge them so she was out of luck but, when they are charged, they work great!"
RKJKHFKPODH1W,5,These wireless headphones are the best!! The sound on these headphones is incredible it sounds like surround sound!!
R1WNUTVJ4QJUM5,4,Moved baby monitor to another location in the room . Headphones work better
RO24JGR54A7TC,5,"A blessing. , Now only my husband has to hear his programs and not the entire neighborhood."
R23ZNXT839RMQ7,4,Phones are great!  I can go to my office and still hear the TV!  They don't fit very well though.... too wide and fall off my head.  I have hearing problems and can understand every word.  Other phones are too bassy for me.  These make hearing sound normal.
R1X72UL2LJWNSX,1,Headphones shocked me when I took them out of the charger or put them in the charger also they were intermittent while using. I have returned them.
RYV8SL394ZDC,5,Great quality headphones. They're quite comfortable too!
R15OIL0MUJRCX5,5,Light weight and very clear .
R3VLXSKW7EQPDP,4,"These headphones have a good range. I have a 1200 sq. ft. two story home and I can go anywhere in my house and these headphones maintain a crystal clear signal. With respect to audio reproduction this unit does have an impressive range of frequencies. The bass response doesn't have quite the punch I like but I'm one of those that like a lot of bass and that's just me. If they just added a tone control to this headset they would be perfect as far as sound quality goes. As far as the fit goes, they weren't designed to be ergonomically ideal. The way the ear pieces fit against my ears leave a small gap towards the back of my ears and fit a bit tight against the fronts of my ears, they just don't fit squarely against your ears. This makes them a lil uncomfortable after a while and also allows them to want to slide forward when you look down a bit easier than they really should. The headband doesn't go straight across from one earpiece to the other either, this makes feel a lil awkward too especially when you combine that aspect with the angled pivots on the earpieces. The unit just has an awkward and klunky feel to the way it fits your head. I think the designers were just concerned with making this unit look hi tech and lost touch with fit and comfort. With all that said if you are looking for a good deal on an entry level wireless headset then this is truly a good buy. I do not regret buying this set and would recommend them because I'm very pleased with the sound quality but if comfort is one of your highest priorities then I would recommend looking to a more upscale set than this one.  My main goal in purchasing a wireless headset was to keep from disturbing my wife at night and still getting good sound reproduction and it fit those requirements very well so overall I'm happy with my purchase."
R31IGQOO4X233,5,My husband LOVES these!
R1OHOVO8K0PMME,4,"I recently replaced my old headphone, also Sennheiser, model unknown, with the RS 120.  The quality of the sound is excellent.  However, when changing sound reception from one TV to another, the tuning is not as easy as it was with my old headphone.  The old model had two tuning positions and I could switch from one TV to the other easily. The new one does not have set positions, I kind of have to search like I used to do when searching for a station in radios of the 1950's. It's annoying and I wish you could fix it. But thanks for the great sound."
RJ9FHGYV7YFSZ,5,"Very happy with my new wireless headphones.  I live with two very loud parrots, and sometimes when my TV is on, they are competing for my attention.  So I turn the TV up to be able to hear, and what do they do?  They get louder, squawking and whistling.  It's quite funny and I enjoy their antics, but it makes paying attention to dialogue more difficult.  So, I got these headphones, because my TV and the sofa are at least 6 feet away, so a wired set wouldn't work.  I like how easy they were to set up, and that when not in use, they recharge on their stand.  They are very comfortable, and the sound is crystal clear.  I would definitely recommend these wireless headphones!"
R1WZMOJ13Q3FDT,1,I bought this on-ear for 95$ in 2 months it was 65$. And after 4 months of my delivery now it doesn't work completely! Don't buy this product!
RQFFT2ML5YYWE,5,GREAT!
R3FOSBSB4PH0DY,1,"I bought these for my son who likes to play his music loud. He put them on without checking the volume control on the headphones and blasted his eardrums. Refuses to use them again as it hurts him just to look at them. He didn't tell me until after the return date passed, so I am stuck with them."
R15A5ZMSJZFO,5,"One year in.  Very light.  Great sound quality.  My wife doesn't hear a thing.<br /><br />I did have one brief problem. Once plugged in to the TV, the TV's volume must be set at some reasonable level (as opposed to a quiet level). The TV itself is not emitting sound but the volume affects the signal going to the headphone transmitter.  If it gets too low, the headphones generate an incredibly loud static that is sure to annoy you. After a night or two of this, I was about to send them back but found the solution online. I did not see any reference to a minimum volume level in the directions but the set up is so intuitive, I cannot say for certain that I read them.<br /><br />In any case, the headphones do exactly what I need them to do and I actually like the sound quality over the LG TV speakers. I can hear dialogue much better."
RR1VS98K5JAD6,3,Its bigger than I like.  Would prefer something small enough that wouldn't feel so intrusive.  Sound is good.  Easy to install.
R1GC9R29ZRBTR6,3,Would prefer the ear pieces to be more cup like than foam flat.
R3CUWT8D7D3NA,5,Great quality headphone set.  This set has lasted me for years.  Battery still going strong.
R20A60JSLP7EXE,5,work great.  Able to listen to my television while walking throughout my home.  Would recommend to anyone
RHG2QRZWSW0AL,1,Stopped working after one month .
RCY2ZOZ3VG2SL,4,These work pretty well.  There is some background hum at times which can be minimized with fine tuning.  I had to find adapters to connect to 1/4 inch and mini plug for iPod etc.  The unit comes with two male stereo RCA jacks on the cable end.  I use it for practicing electric guitar without disturbing my wife.  I'll likely try them on a TV soon.
R1U1LRLX77C5M9,4,THESE ARE EXTREMELY EASY TO USE AND INCREASE CLARITY WHICH THES OLD EARS NEED
R3MHZ4WJNHIL2S,5,"Sucks....can't get any channel / transmitter to pick up any clean reception. Secondly, the headphones aren't stable ..return I g this with great disappointment because I had such big  excitement and expectations ....sad!"
R1LCMQ62N0Z9MT,5,"I am somewhat hearing impaired and wear hearing aids. Regardless, in order for me to follow dialogue on TV shows my wife still complained that the TV volume was too loud for her. With good input from my daughter my wife got this set for me for Christmas. With over two months of use now, I cannot say enough good things about this Sennheiser headset. What I hear with them is full stereo, high fidelity sound that I never experienced with the sound system on my TV. I am now hearing nuances of speech and sound effects that eludes me without them. I do not wear them all of the time, just for movies and other programs that have challenging soundtracks.<br /><br />Now, since this headset is an &#34;on the ear&#34; design there is a bit of a comfort issue. I have managed to minimize discomfort via the adjustments on the ear pieces. The earpads do tend to get pretty warm after a while, too. Batteries don't last long so I use rechargable AAA's and always have fresh ones on hand. The wireless range in my house is very good. I can go to the kitchen or the basement or upstairs bedroom and never lose reception.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
R3AB04CWD7Y7MH,2,"We purchased two pairs of the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones for our bedroom in December of 2014. After thoroughly researching all of the available wireless units we patiently waited for any of our top three choices to be featured on a lightning deal. The sound on the units are fantastic. I couldn't  ask for better, however we have given it two stars because we have been hugely disappointed with this product as we have been plagued with constant static breakkthrough despite using the tuning knobs. We're tried all of the troubleshooting techniques, but so far nothing helps. Also, another annoyance is that one of the ear covers keeps falling off. I do wish to send these cheaply made headphones back and get a refund, but so far customer service had been less than helpful. If you want headphones full of static, then this is your product, otherwise STAY AWAY!"
R1397IWHQLN8F8,5,"Over the last year or so my boyfriend and I have used these regularly with no problems. Sometimes there's a little fuzz when you go out of range or turn a certain way, but for the most part, they're great. The sound is good, and they're very comfortable, even for my boyfriend who has a gigantic noggin."
R23380SNM9EDEK,3,"I wish I could rate this product higher but I really can't.  I took my time to write this review because I wanted to get an honest feel for their performance over time, and it hasn't fared amazingly.  For the first while I had the headphones they worked great, with minimal to no static or popping (which is actually common to wireless headphones not using bluetooth)  but after a while the static started to creep in, and eventually popping as well.  At this point I have a hard time listening to music with them without getting a headache, which is very disappointing since I'm only in the next room from the base.  Whether it's a degradation over time or perhaps something operating on a similar frequency the headphones are hard to use at this point, so be aware that they may not work fantastically all the time."
R1JJUDAEERQSVF,5,Great product
R1URTACT8SBKU0,5,would buy again.
R3SW1FQMOKVEB9,5,"These are amazing. Esp when Wifey goes to bed&#34;turn it down ,please.&#34; No more, now i can Turn It Up! good Range and you can hear details you've never heard before.  Very comfy.."
RPUFEDKEWDCH8,4,"Good wireless headset. No problems with sound or connection. One note, when adjusting size avoid touching metal piece that is for charging, you could get some feedback that could be loud in your ears. Otherwise quite satisfied."
R5H78AYGEME1T,5,better than expected
R3IRRL4Y550EI9,2,"Kept them for a couple of weeks and then returned them. After using them for an hour or so, the headphones would lose the connection and all I would hear is static. Another small complaint is that the power chord is hard to seat in the base unit. When the headphones worked, they were decent but I do not have the patience to keep fiddling with them."
RPANDZNZ4RMTA,5,"I had bought a set at Wal-Mart  for$20.00 and I thought they were good. After awhile the sound was distorted and I could not understand what people were saying when watching TV. I saw the reviews for this and though they were a little spendy I thought, if they are good then it's money well spent as I have a hearing problem like so many others. I got to tell you I was blown away by the sound quality and the bass. I never dreamed something could be so clear and wonderful. It only took me a few minutes to hook it up to my TV. I have an older model so the jacks were in the back. My other head phones had batteries in the ear as well as the receiver which was a pain to change and also every time I used them had to find the signal. These are so nice. Now I know the difference between on the ear and over the ear. These are much nicer than the over the ears ones. I can't tell you how much my TV viewing as improved. Only those who can't hear can appreciate this. Thank you Amazon once again for meeting my needs."
R1HB8OBCHFMYH0,5,my husband like fell in love with this item. money well spent.
RB25QEIZP24NL,2,"Physically, the product is reasonably well-made. Performance-wise, at least for me, it was lacking. I could live with the small amount of background hum, and the headphones were not uncomfortable. Tuning to the proper frequency was not hard. But the volume would surge inexplicably, gradually reduce itself and then surge louder again over the course of 15-20 minute cycles. Tried new, freshly charged batteries and had the same problem. Sent it back for a refund."
R3M5DUZ2KHMNV8,4,"Very happy with my Sennheiser wireless headset, and my wife is happy also."
RVGKILPDOC996,5,Purchased these as a gift for my hearing impaired husband and he says it is the best gift he has ever received!
RIZGZ87EUV6YK,4,"Works perfectly, just as advertised."
R3DSEFKWKR6YLU,3,Padding on the ear is cheap. Sound is great. I re-gifted them and I am going with a differante pair for home.
R1AAJ7ZKCKXPEU,5,"Are these the best headphones you'll ever hear? No. BUT, for the price you can't beat them.  I read all the reviews before I bought them and was a little scared but figured I'd give them a try.  At the very least I could return them.  After receiving the package, I installed the batteries and allowed them to charge for 24 hours as directed.  Installation was too easy.  Setting them up took less than a few minutes.  As soon as you turn them on, you'll hear static.  That's when you have to tune them in using the wheel/dial/knob on the right ear below the volume wheel.  It'll take you a few tries to get it dialed in perfectly, but you'll know when it's right.  If, after a few minutes, you're still getting static or the sound is &#34;hollow&#34;, adjust the wheel through the full range of travel until you find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; of tuning. Is the tuning know right next to the volume knob? Yes. Is in an issue? Not if you've completed 2nd grade and have a memory only slightly longer than a goldfish.  With regards to the charging cradle, it literally could NOT be easier to use.  Just make sure the cradle/transmitter is on a flat surface and they hang/charge without any effort.  I am 100% convinced that all of the negative reviews about buzzing and static are due to incorrect tuning of the headphones and are a result of what was &#34;between the the headsets&#34; rather than the headsets themselves.  These are not simply &#34;plug and play&#34;, they must be tuned.  However, if you take the extra 10-15 seconds to go through the entire range of the tuning dial, I'm confident you'll find the exact tuning position that sounds great to you and will be more than please with this product.  The only thing I will comment on is the item description.  Although it states, &#34;over the ear&#34;, these are not ear CUPS.  The foam of the headsets sits directly on he ear itself.  This can get tiresome for extended periods of listening, but I personally find them fine for a single movie or a few back to back episodes of my favorite series.  For the price, you can't beat these Sennheiser's. I would definitely recommend them."
R396LD0K2K6DIX,4,"This is a nice piece of equipment and seems to work well and have a good range.  I bought it to replace a 10 year old set I broke.  I am sad to say it does not seem as well built as that one from the same company, but it is lighter weight than the old one and will do the job nicely."
R39E20OXTBSEQH,4,"Good product, easy to operate. I needed a second one for a different room. My other one is regular use for the last 10 years."
R1L7ZBJ5G8TKVM,5,Love these! My wife can sleep while I watch TV in silence. Crystal clear sound. Always funny when I start talking about the TV show and wife reminds me I am wearing headphones :-)
R3AYIIWXN8EDK8,5,Work great and makes for marital harmony since my partial hearing loss.
R2GJUZE0OJH6RR,4,Ok
RNPNGFRNAYXC7,5,"Excellent quality. Excellent product. I do not give more stars that are only 5, I would give 10"
R15NH0VNVYY4NA,5,"Works quite well, wife really appreciates that we can turn off captions.  It has a tuning function that I was not aware at first so I thought is was defective or something not connected properly.  It also tends to drift off frequency a wee bit.  Has to be re-tuned occasionally.  Bought a second one and discovered that while the new one was charging (recommended 24 hrs) the older one would work with the new base just by using the tuning function.  Actually can switch between the two TV's if I change rooms."
R2V8WIWHIPFLS4,5,Great wireless headset good price.
R1NDX5OYT0AVQR,2,Very hard to get the sound balanced.  Would not buy again.
R1EV7SO211PB17,5,work perfect with my samsung smart tv
RAQTZIM20UKM4,5,I use the headphones every day for around 2 hours and I've had them for over a month. So far I'm very pleased with their performance and I feel that they have met all my expectations. I saw a few reviews that mentioned static and a sudden loss of signal. This has not been a problem for me. The charging station is convenient. The signal and sound quality have been superb. I highly recommend this product. And as usual the ordering process and delivery was quick and easy.
R3K5DR0G46O0TK,5,Much better than TV Ears.
R11UCYH5L4G3A5,5,Works great and it so clear!
RRZASRZ53DTKD,5,Very clear reception.  Great at a distance.  Enjoyed hearing m y favorite programs.  Recommend purchasing this unit.
RO9LX6YI76U9E,5,I love it
R2N6ANE1AHEMEL,5,Speedy delivery. Purchased for my husband. He loved it. Headphones are big but comfy. Only used once so far but the sound and clarity was great. These are his 1st pair so I cannot compare it to any other brand. So far so good.
R135K6XPKX6VCF,4,Great sound. My only complaint is the ear pieces are felt/cloth material. And then feel hot on my ears. Charging station is nice.
R6290N9Z2DDGD,4,Ok.
R2QATI8OV6606Y,5,Excellent choice. This has relieved the volume wars between myself and the rest of the family.
RBFSVHJNUZXDZ,5,"This set of headphones works well and I'm very happy with the reception.  I also have another pair that I bought last year, exact same type but that pair of headphones is now having a a lot of interference when using them ...  lots of static.  not sure if this is because I'm not tuning them right or they are in need of repair.  Other than that I'm very happy with how they operate.  These headphones have two sets of buttons to operate in order to get the performance you are happy with.  Takes a little time but its worth it."
R192T38PV4S6YJ,5,"I received the wireless Sennheiser head phones fast and in great condition.  I love these head phones, this is the second pair I own and use them every day."
RRWJ1UZYQGX27,5,Got one for my wife and one for me. She hears the TV better and I watch TV late at night so I don't disturb the house.
R2NAN5NRH3O9LK,5,"I am frequently up later at night than the rest of my family, and these headphones have allowed me to listen to television programs without disturbing anyone! They are simple to set up, and have been working great from day one. My son hooked them into our system, I let them charge fully overnight and they were ready to go. The sound is crisp and can be tuned as needed, along with volume control- both right on the headset. I mute our television so the sound is only heard through the headset, but, these headphones can be also used to enhance sound for those with some hearing loss- just adjust your tv volume to what the rest of the viewers need, and they can enjoy watching/listening at the same time. Glad I got them!"
R1EQP8W4CLVCYU,5,I can't think you can buy anything better with this price. Very satisfied with this order.
RIINXIWMYJ6ZS,5,"Works  just  liike  the  the information about  the RS120  states  it  would.  If  you  want  to  hear  the  TV  and  understand  what  is  being  said,  then  these  headphones  are  the  one's  to  purchase.  I  think  Sennheiser  is  a  good  manufacturer."
R29WQ8LD4MQTSL,2,headset too tight and not adjustable
R8P9JZ8D4021R,4,Very good.
R1H0DY2CT2JXYD,2,Theres a lot of static is like having an antenna you have to find the right angle to get the best sound.
R1IDX2SU7L7KRT,5,They perform better than I had expected.
R9WN3D8AA6FEH,5,Wonderful!!
R2Q5IJ993GOLNA,5,Good
R37110NIR6ZFDV,1,"Broken out of the box, would not turn on.... returned"
R2Z360VZNO48MX,5,Great product I would be glad to recommend to others.
R34RTFSX77E19X,4,"for the money, they work great....had trouble with the first set(one side didn't work) they were replaced and 2nd pair worked fine."
R2RRORVT6LK4M2,5,A little bulky...BUT...works fine.  I am truly enjoying TV again!
R1860YAEZOF7GV,5,"I have owned several on-ear wireless headphones, but never one like Sennheiser that provides me with such clarity! The headphones are comfortable and adjustable as well. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
R1ST6K693DNAS3,5,Got these for my wife as she has a hard time hearing the television. They work and sound Awesome!! AAA+++
R34KTSALCV0SDZ,3,Works very good after I found how to use it
R38UN6B4BBU38P,5,I couldn't be happier with these wireless headphones.<br /><br />Easily connected into my TiVo Cable Box and the signal was plenty loud and clear.<br /><br />They even included the batteries!
R2ZWIVQI5713YI,2,Tried 2 different times and each one malfunctioned... poor sound quality
R2YUOOODFN6BJA,5,"These are great! Set-up with my TV was a breeze. Sound quality is excellent. No buzz or hum. Range is good. Comfortable to wear. Been using for a few months and no complaints at all. Truly, these have saved my marriage. I am a late night binge TV watcher, and even watching in another room the noise was keeping my wife awake. Now: blissful silence and marital peace! Why did I wait so long?"
RSK3010IKIPWT,5,Great
ROF7G4SHKQM51,4,Only gave it 4 stars because I wish the headphones were smaller. Still they block out my mom in law effectively:-)
R3P3E8LDRP7KM6,5,"Bought one for myself..AWESOME, almost life changing.<br /><br />Bought a second one for my wife for use on a different TV.. SHE LOVES IT!<br /><br />Great quality at a great price."
R3IF1VZIFRFGFO,5,Great product.
R10ZGX2T0ZXHTI,4,The best & great sound
RZR52NXMPWIM3,5,Works great with no annoying wires.
R1477T8PP1Y8P,5,So far so good. I still can't believe after all these years this device is very much needed. Well it serves me well so far. Quality is great and once the tuning is perfected the sound quality is great. I recommend this for all those who share a house with someone and want to watch tv without bothering anyone else.
R18LQKREECIOA6,3,"Some things you should know about these that I wish I knew before buying them... First of all let me say I think they sound great and I absolutely love that they charge by hanging on a little metal frame. That's super cool and convenient.. However, my experience was less than ideal making these work. I wouldn't use these for your recording studio, but I use them for watching movies and they are wonderful. So here I go:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sound great for watching movies (good bass, midrange, and treble)<br />Comfortable, forget they are on<br />Great range, like really great range<br />Long lasting charge<br />Convenient base<br /><br />Cons:<br />Well this is going to be a bit of a rant.. Why did they put RCA cables on this? When I got this I couldn't plug it into anything except an AMP but I wanted to hook them to a computer, or a laptop, or maybe a phone, or basically anything modern that doesn't run through an AMP! They made these like you're going to use them in a high end audio scenario or a studio.. and even in a high end audio environment or studio, a headphones jack would work just fine! Really limiting what you can hook these too.<br />So, this meant for me to realistically use them for what I had intended, I had to cut the end off and put my own headphones jack on the end. I'm good with wires so I knew I could handle it... but, holy crap the wire is SO THIN even my wire cutters gave me a ton of trouble cutting it, I kept ripping it and I was starting to run out of wire.. getting frustrated.. and NOT EVEN SURE if it was going to work! To my surprise when I finally strapped electrical tape on them and hooked them up they DID work. I'm using them now in fact..<br />The wires were not colored well so it was like a movie where they defuse a bomb I had to totally guess on which channel is L and R.. and guess what I did it backwards? So now when I watch movies and a car drives by, the audio goes backwards through my ears. The process of splicing a new end on was so miserable this is just how they are now lol... but now I can never resell them! The resale value dropped to $0 for me.<br /><br />End thoughts: Put a dang normal connector on these! This isn't 1980! I want to use this with my modern devices.as so miserable this is just how they are now lol... but now I can never resell them! The resale value dropped to $0 for me.<br /><br />End thoughts: Put a dang normal connector on these! This isn't 1980! I want to use this with my modern devices."
R3BD5EE6MK99TK,1,"Unfortunately, we dropped these headphones, and they broke! The sound was never great, but I was shocked that the quality is so low - and we could never figure out how to use them when we watched the satellite TV or the Roku. We'd be watching a movie on the Roku, and the headphones would still be transmitting what was on the cable TV."
R1TPU5OILODKLW,1,had to reorder twice. Each one broke. The latest broke down after 3 months....do not waste your money.
R3PL3SY7H8XRA7,5,"I have 3 of these - for work and home.  This is the 5th year I've gotten a pair as a prize for a company event.  They're spectacular - especially when you factor in the price - unbelievable really.  They're comfortable, work well, and work FAR!  The sound is good and everyone seems to be happy with them.  I also bought my nephew a pair so he can carry on with his gaming and not disturb the rest of his family."
R3OC9WWL26TCOM,5,They are great!!! They amazing sound quality.  It so nice if someone wants to watch TV while someone needs the silence in the same room.  You can also walk all over the house upstairs and downstairs and still hear what you're watching on TV.
R57K4WG7CKBHI,5,"Very clear and static free sound., easy set-up.<br />I purchased these to replace an aging Sony set. I need to either blast the tv sound or wear these to actually hear and understand the programs. I am very inpressed with Sennheiser !"
R14K5IIOAAENVR,2,Terrible. No matter what you do you can't get rid of the static in your ears. And if you manage to find more or less clear signal you have to become a statue and not turn your head even slightly or you will have to start tuning again.
RE5H8096EL6CP,1,The hiss is louder than the show I want to watch.  Charged it for 24 hours and returned after 10 minutes of use.
R1KXGQJIJDF9XC,5,love it
R2IB1FBVWKWHT4,1,JUNK PERIOD
R3GEM8U3DDSSP3,3,"Headphones are great, but a more compact design would be more comfortable."
R3OQ9V7ZP7F884,5,This is my third pair & I love them.  I wear them all day & night.  I have one on the charger all the time & when I go to bed at night I take it off the charger & put the one I was wearing on the charger that way I'm never out of power.  I wear it outside while I'm doing my garding.  I don't miss.  I  any of my TV shows. I'm very very happy.
R2276DUVGF1J8V,5,Great product. No feedback clear sound. Great TV ears.
R3FEDQZWODUU1G,5,These headphones do exactly what I needed them to - deliver great sound across the room without disturbing anyone!<br /><br />The audio is actually considerably better with the headphones than through the TV speakers on my 60&#34; Sharp Aquos widescreen. Others in the room cannot hear sound coming from the headphones either. Just what I was hoping for - great product.
R1H3MV0PTBSVTJ,5,Great headphones.  Work as advertised.
RS4ML4KSK2KLZ,5,Arrived on time and works great
R1IIZ4CGP1H09K,5,They work great!  Love them!
R8ZNVG9TQZ8VP,3,"They are nice..  I must have a weird sized head because they continually slide off. I can't walk around in them, and if I adjust my seating, they slide off.  I wish I had a head strap on them!  The sound quality is good - hooking them up is ok."
RTOFJD4CAF6CM,5,Bought this for my wife. She loves it!!!
R2PJB2CD29X6R9,5,I was looking for something like this to make my housework hours more enjoyable. I nearly ruined them when I put batteries inside and placed the headphones on the cradle. Lifetime for the rechargeables is probably about a year. Then you need to replace them. I also got a special convertor cable that lets me to use them with my laptop.
R336NJCLETBLP1,4,I really like these headphones.  I had TV Ears before and they were awful.  I paid over $200 for the TV Ears and they did not fit well in the ears and broke.  These headphones have great sound quality and are easy to use and of course the price is right.  As other people said in their review; there is sometimes static which is annoying but overall they are great.
R6L7B3FLHDVO3,2,"it is almost impossible to adjust sound to come out of both earpieces equally. Volume control is excellent.  At times I get the sound balanced from both earphones and then it fades out to only one ear.  I find that the range is fantastic. I can walk into other room and still hear everything very clearly.  Unless I got a bad unit, I would not buy these again.  I've already thrown out the box so returning then seems out of the question."
R3V8XIMPSYMQIS,1,Your description did not sufficiently describe the difficulty of installation.
R2L8U9XKIZ1C2N,5,This is an amazing item I have two of them for myself and for when a friend comes over great!!!!!!  Freakin sound you'll love it.
R2W31Y2CKLJUF,5,"wonderful, hearing sounds and depth I had not heard before !"
R69QSUL7D4MQT,5,"Works great on one tv, haven't figured out how to get working on other set, need grandson!"
R2OEI4HBW94531,5,"I got this for my wife who likes to walk around and continue to work on her quilts, while watching her shows.<br />My mother, who is hard of hearing, has her tv so loud in an adjacent room that my wife could not watch her shows in peace.<br />Now she can. She really likes it."
R3ERRA3CD4UYKH,5,"Husband has hearing loss doesn't wear his hearing aides so always cranks up tv and runs the rest of us out of the house as he flips that darn remote through the channels. I ordered these for his Christmas present.  At first he looked at me like I was crazy but once he put them on he was hooked.  Easy to hook up to the TV, The sound quality is clear and stereo.  He hears and understands better with these that when  he wears only his hearing aides. I tried them out and wished I could afford a set for myself.  Worth the money for sure."
R29YD7UJDQGW0T,5,Excellent product! Works great! Easy set up!
R30WG68UE5NTTY,4,They seem to work as advertised. They are a little uncomfortable after a while but nothing that I didn't expect.  After years of wearing pods almost any headphone is a little uncomfortable.
RCKBDI62ZHOR0,5,Love the wireless feature!
R2WUWY0CISRJ66,1,"my unit stopped working after 5 hours of use. it came shipped without padding, thrown in a CC box. Careless - &#34;We got your money, here's your crap.&#34; The negatives are heavy clunky ear pieces, and a clunky design that ruins your hearing by blasting you with hi freak sound. It's a &#34;feature&#34; that the unit blasts loud hi freak sound whenever it does not get audio input. Not a good listening experience. That's about it. Too bad a careless manager and engineer made bad design choices - the right way is to transmit silent carrier all the time - The auto-shutoff is stupid, since a silent carrier does not use much energy anyway. Probably some politically correct &#34;euro spasm&#34; to be &#34;green.&#34; eek!"
R813EIPFVQ0PK,3,They are adequate.  No lag on the sound. I would buy again
R4NJNMG5JY7BC,5,work as expected
R28CWQJ9NY4SVH,4,"Very good sound quality, but the fit is a little loose  and they fall off when I bend over. Also, battery life is unpredictable and the radio link frequency drifts when the battery gets low. However, since I got them at a very discounted price, I am very pleased with the purchase. I use them to listen to TV since my hearing is poor (tinnitus) and I don't want to have the TV volume so high that it disturbs others. Also, it's nice to be able to leave the room briefly and still be able to hear the dialogue. Originally planned to also use them in bed, but they are too bulky for that."
RZDVJH7BBRKHW,3,Really liked them but they just quite working after about 6 months.  Too bad too because they were handy for working around the house and kitchen while not having to play with the stereo/ tv volume repeatedly or having to rewind because I missed something
R3O1FPZB3J46D6,5,"I have had other head sets. they aren't even close to the quality sennheisr rs120, thank you, hard to get good items at a reasonable price, I have a hearing problem they are great so far."
R1R1T77FYC4FKU,3,"I am having trouble with the reception.  The headphones work fine for the first hour long program I am watching.  But by the second or third hour, they seem to be picking up reception from some other source and it drowns out the program I am watching on TV.  Adjusting the tuning does not seem to help.  This is a mystery, as we have another set of these exact same headphones on our downstairs television and have NEVER had any problems with them.  I walk all over the house with the downstairs headphones and never lose reception. But this last set I bought for the upstairs room is giving me a problem."
R1TYB6ITRT9WMB,5,"These have to be the best earphones in this price range. Sennheiser is known for their awesome products, and this is no exception. It sound great and the battery life is outstanding."
RIS9392CNS172,5,Great Sound!
R3SZICTQ9L1AA6,5,"My husband is hard of hearing and this has made him so happy watching tv.  He marvels at the surround sounds.  He has purchased several<br />other headphones that never worked well, but this one is perfect."
R38ZNJ2SHSXUYA,4,Using it for more than a year. Only complaint is the back ground static.
R26Z75P83UMMM2,5,A truly amazing set. Setup was easy and performance is excellent.
R1T16YVRJ70P5Z,5,"easy to use, husband can listen to tv and I can read"
RS2C68YNFUICC,3,"Didn't solve the problem.  I don't think it was the product, just the problem that we were trying to resolve."
R2OYPU8OINV45G,5,Work really nice and are easy to use and adjust. The wife loves them I can tell because she no longer screams from the bedroom TURN IT DOWN !!!!
R2CWAAXWP1I8UY,5,thanks
R3C14QRJR9RU2Z,3,OK
R16EG9XFMKA23U,5,Works great. easy on the ears too!
R2H5PRWZ0YI5S1,5,Perfect for people who live together but do not watch the same shows!
R3A9XUTRGCELNM,5,I got these for my dad who has hard hearing. Now my whole family can watch a movie without having to have the volume up to max!!!:)
RL7C1Y4DRLIK6,1,"They are not what I was expecting. I thought I can use them outside as well inside but you can't use them outside and the signal is very weak, they are for inside use only plus I thought the headphones itself had a 3.5 mm jack on them but they don't. The description should of had more details what's the whole purpose of a wireless headphones if you have to be right next to the charge base to get good signal and plus I don't wanna be next to the charge base just to switch songs on my phone and I don't wan't a long wire in my way across the floor next to me just to change a song,"
R3RUHMQXJVLUK1,4,"This is a great product for remote listening to pretty much anything.  While I only use it for the TV the headphones come with a number of adapters so you can plug it into cable boxes, TV's, cell phones, headphone outputs, etc.  The noise quality is impressive for the price and is perfectly clear in my application.  They are not the most comfortable headphones as they are on the ear and don't insulate you from outside noises, but I haven't had any issue with wearing them for a couple of hours at a time."
RGO7IYWG9J7L3,5,These were for my mom. She is 83 years and loves them. She can hear the TV clearly now.
R2J4WEWCTUNQHJ,5,"It was completely compatible with our home system of AV equipment, including another RS120 already in place.  The ability to make TV voice audio much clearer when irksome background music tends to drown out voices is a true blessing."
R3SIPDLGVYKQI9,3,"If there is no signal being used for a short while it cuts off and blasts white noise into your bones. sound isn't very good but standard. If I add something new to the mix, it blows everything else out, lowers all volume then slowly goes back to normal."
R1MAD0O2AUV5IG,1,"This stupid thing always loses the signal and I get blasted by loud static.  I no longer use it, it now sits in my graveyard of crappy electronic devices drawer."
R1N77CPNOA9NB3,5,Perfect!  Exactly what we needed. My husband is hard of hearing so now with the headphones he can have the TV at whatever volume he wants and I am not blasted out of the room. Love them and highly recommend.
R24MRY7O2PHQZC,5,The headphones work well  Had to adjust TV sound setting to get the mute to work on the TV but not on the headset.  User issue not the headphones.
R3TVV441K7G1KJ,2,"I received these and then couldn't use them, as I had to have another adapter. Had to order new cords.."
RZMPM6VCS1QYN,1,"It work well as times, however to often yields a disappointing performance."
R1H0OSB8RY6BQD,5,they work great
R3O5VKV1L7UJGI,2,"had tinny sound. returned it for refund. the sennheiser  high end, more expensive line are probably better but overpriced compared to the sony products"
R1WXJMKJV06I41,5,"Get in the huddle !  I really enjoy watching football games broadcast in DTS with these headphones.  I am able to pick-up everything that is being broadcast..... from on the field trash talk, to quarterback audibles, to fans in the stands.  Super clear audio, great battery/charge life, good wireless range and no interference issues.  I predominately use these in a room that also contains my multi-band wireless internet router and an access point for our mobile.  Don't miss another word, great for listening to movies and TV too.  Great buy !"
R3IXKU5XZWHBRC,4,"this product was well reviewed and recommended around the internet, and was better priced that some competitors. it works OK. i have not been able to find a setting that eliminates ALL background static, but the static isn't enough to ruin my viewing experience. the one complaint i have is a well-documented issue around the internet...the &#34;auto-off&#34; feature. that is: if your source volume is below a certain level, then the signal transmitter in the base station will simply shut off after some predetermined number of minutes. this results in very loud and sudden static on the headphones, which is a notably unpleasant experience. after learning about this issue first hand, i searched the web and found a lot of people complaining about this. it seems that the only way to avoid that situation is by making sure that the source volume is set somewhere above that magic cutoff point. haven't used this enough to discover exactly where that cutoff is. hoping to find it one day..."
RDXG30YQTC88M,3,More comfortable than TV ears.  So far we are very happy with them.
R2JK4N4W85JSZD,5,great range. Far superior to most others
R2VUY1VR9IIZ4J,5,"Just received these headphones and the sound is amazing. I have significant hearing loss and have to have closed captioning when I watch TV, but with these headphones I can hear so clearly every word spoken and the music is wonderful.  It sounds like you're in a movie theater! No more CC for me!"
R206KOX565CJZB,5,These are the very best headphones I have ever bought.I am hard of hearing for the first time in yearsi can watch tv they are twenty times better than tv earsvthe soundis c l e a r not just loud. They are free of t static and you will not go wrong I am going to buy another set you can walk fom room to room and hear perfectly what a Godsend thank you Sennheiser for giving me my ears back I wish you made hearin aids.
R18L75761WYDY0,5,"i bought these for my step dad, because my mom babysits. now he can watch tv and hear it plus help drowns out the noise from the kids."
RA7KO3HM6XP71,5,"These are fantastic, use the all the time for night time tv viewing"
R8G2V6QGJ5O13,5,"I replaced TV Ears 5.0 with these, which are EVERYTHING TV EEars are not:  Very comfortable, with crystal clear sound, at 1/3 the price.  Far, far, far superior.  How does TV Ears stay in business??????"
R39YZV71XQ1DVA,5,Great product; great customer service
R17PVJOF1I4BB3,5,Great so far. It had a major delay with video to sound when connected to the DirectTV box. Connecting to TV resolved.
R2OQRFDDI40LNC,5,"I use theese Head phones about 4 hours everyDay for the last Year, They are awesome."
R1AJ8STO2GA0A6,5,I'm electronically challenged but was able to connect it myself.  It works great.
R2A2TLSVZB6Y2V,5,Great headphones! my husband is very hard of hearing and these are perfect for him. We can turn the tv completely down and he can still hear the tv through his earphones by adjusting the volume as loud as he wants. Even more funny he has walked a little ways down our street with his headphones and can still hear the tv. This is our second set and we ordered it for the bedroom. You won't be dissappointed!
R2CKCGSAVLAVCR,5,"These headphones are very very good - an improvement compared to cheaper headphones I purchased a couple of years ago. The sound is so much better. Recharging them is easier. The headphones are ADJUSTABLE for anyone's head. I would certainly purchase another pair from Sennheiser - probably will in the near future to place in the back bedroom with the other TV.  UPDATE 8/18/15 I did purchase a second pair of Sennheiser 120 wireless headphones. I am updating because I am thoroughly impressed by Sennheiser's technical support. I purchased 2 of these headphones for the basic High Definition televisions in our home. Excellent headphones. Easy to &#34;install,&#34; to connect.   One TV died. So I purchased a new TV - an LG 4K 55 inch smart TV. Excellent TV - but that is a different review. The wireless headphones didn't communicate initially with the LG.  Actually only when I plugged in the jacks to the cable box did I get audio - ONLY from cable channels. No audio from the DVD player or with online services such as Netflix. I was sorely disappointed.  The headphones are a &#34;must&#34; in our household.   THEN Sennheiser tech support came to the rescue. First there was no long wait time. I was speaking with a person within seconds (I did call at about 8:15 AM). Sennheiser tech support said to purchase the Orei DA34 Digital to Analog DECODER. Tech support also said to get a digital optical audio cable. I did both through Amazon. I emphasize the DECODER. There are other similar items called converters. Once all the connections were made and after adjusting the audio settings (internal speakers = audio out) in the LG there was audio from cable stations, the DVD player, online service. I was excited. I was thrilled!! Turns out there was no need to purchase the digital optical audio cable. Orei included one in the package - &#34;hidden&#34; beneath the plastic support box in which lay the DECODER."
R1OM8SRXDG5PNN,5,"I bought the TV Ears they crapped out after 6 months, they hurt my ears from the pressure of the little knob like pieces in my ears. I did not like them but the Sennheiser RS 120 are really great. There is no comparison in comfort and the Sennheiser has much better sound as well.  Don't waste your money on TV ears when you can get these."
R2NDGTD9D0GPEP,5,These are really great!!! I had some others but they didn't hold a charge.
R1BOD27QDRONP0,5,"I LOVE these headphones!  I enjoy them so much that after years of purchasing on Amazon, this is my FIRST review ever.  I am not a high tech person or super into audio.  I am someone that was looking to a pair of wireless headphones to watch TV or movies with at night.  Every pair I have had in the past  had static or horrible sound.  These are GREAT, very clear sound no static and are so easy to hook up!  I liked them so much I recently purchased a second pair, which by the way can work off the same transmitter so we can both watch with headphones!  I would comment on how great the price is, but I would buy them  at a higher price as well.  VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!"
R24T1Q9TF2SHT7,1,"I bought these to replace wired headphones since the wired ones kept getting in the way with how my desk is set up.  I really wish I could wholeheartedly recommend them, but they have really glaring issues that make them inconvenient at best.  Pros: When properly tuned, sound quality is really good Battery life is fine, the charging dock is nice and stable. Range is good for most of my apartment (20-30 feet maybe and through walls). Comfortable  Cons: Tuning wheel doesn't stay in place, so it sometimes needs to be adjusted after getting it right.  Recently, having the sound on the headphones turned down too far will turn off one of the speakers. The biggest issue, and why I gave this 1 star despite everything else, is that there is a &#34;feature&#34; (bug in my opinion) where the charging dock stops broadcasting if it detects that it isn't being fed sound.  I'm not totally clear on why this is there, but whenever it does the headphones will start playing really bad static, and of course it comes out of nowhere usually.  More importantly, it often starts doing this even if I am listening to something, I guess because I don't listen to things at a loud enough volume for it, and I can't simply turn up the computer volume and turn down the headphone volume because of the issue with the earpiece turning off.  If this feature were taken out or could be disabled these headphones would be 4/5."
R3PKQ459CTMOPG,4,These have good sound and reception for the money.  They are also more comfortable than I expected.  Just ONE quibble:  Replace the cheap ON/OFF switch with more durable rocker switch and bump the price a couple of bucks - come on you can do it!
RK0J6WZSCC94K,3,"The first set had to be returned because one of the headphones didn't work.  So far, the second pair has been fine."
RFY146DB6UIN9,5,I have purchased 6 of these for myself and friends. I had problems in less then a year with one of them and manufacturer replaced. Good Service.
R2PA2X7G1V7TOT,5,love it. The sound is clearer than expected.
ROPDOF1DI6726,5,"This is my second set of these headphones. The first one is still going strong after five years. Got another one because of the great reduced price. The sound quality is superb. Comfortable, easy to set on recharger.  I have used the headset up to eight hours and have never had any problems with battery life. I live in a small apartment so can't attest to it's range. I am convinced Sennheiser is the best for my price range."
R3MSQZSH1ZXKU9,3,"Great quality reception. Lightweight and easily stored for stylish charging. I have Directv with DVR where I remotely access the bedroom TV. I unfortunately use the device in the bedroom. I'll be using the device for about 10-15 minutes, listening to one of my favorite shows when suddenly, the transmission clicks to white noise static. The headset has new batteries and is fully charged. But for whatever reason it loses its audio connection. Could be my TV. Could be the headset. Could be aliens attempting earthly communications. Haven't had time to troubleshoot the problem."
R1QAARXL08HQ8I,3,The sound quality is great however the headphones Will keep falling off.
R1PL04T6UBRUT8,3,"I've had these almost two years. I think they are OK. They certainly aren't awful. I've used them as a general night time headphone for TV when my wife is asleep. We just had a baby and I'm on the baby night shift, so I'm using these a lot now and it's really clarified my opinions about them.<br /><br />- The price is really pretty good. No complaints there<br />- The sound quality is terrible by wired headphone standards and just OK by wireless headphone standards. I don't really have a big problem with the sound, considering the price. The hiss is always audible and the sound is otherwise just OK. The dynamics are pretty lazy, but again, OK for the price, considering it's wireless<br />- They are not comfortable for long listening sessions. They sit on the ear, not around, which should be fine, but they don't pivot around the vertical axis, which means if they don't align to your head, they will sit all on one spot of you ear and it will become irritating. The plastic frame is somewhat flexible, but not enough to deal with this issue. I find that I'm shifting them around the headphones after an hour or so and it never gets comfortable again until I take them off for a while. On top of all of this, the foam on the ear pad is not very plush to cover up the alignment issue. This would be a great place for them to spend an extra dollar and charge ten more. It would really transform this product for me.<br />- The ergonomics of the knobs are really terrible. The tuning knob is right next to the volume knob. I don't see why I would ever need to adjust the tuning after initial setup, so it's just an irritation to bump it when adjusting the volume. If they would have put the tuning knob somewhere else, I would say the ergonomics would go from terrible to great. It's such a critical blunder...<br />- The charging station works pretty well. Good marks there.<br />- I think they look fine. Not really special looking, but it's fine.<br />- Battery life is good. I've never runout of batteries without leaving them off the charger for a long time.<br />- Weight is fine. No complaints.<br />- My biggest complaint is something that is out of Sennheiser's control, so I will complain, but don't consider this a mark against Sennheiser. I can't get these to hook up to my receiver properly. What I want is for them to always be connected and not interfere with normal receiver operation. My receiver does not output audio out of any of the RCA outputs when using the audio over HDMI inputs (the only inputs I use), so I can't plug the headphones into the RCA outputs. My TV can talk to my audio over HDMI sources, but the receiver does something to the audio so that the TV can't  receive the audio, so I can't hook the headphones to the TV audio out. This wasn't an issue before, as I use the receiver for all speakers, not the TV. So I am left with only the headphone jack on my receiver. Plugging into the headphone jack on the receiver disables the loudspeakers, so I can't leave the headphones plugged into the receiver headphone jack -- requiring plugging into and disconnecting the headphones every time I want to use the headphones."
R3E9E33M6D1S5F,5,"Got these for my dad for Christmas as his hearing has been slowly going. He wanted something to watch TV and These have been great for him! Setup was a breeze, just plug in receiver and go. Sound is very good with little to no interference so far. He sits about 12 ft - 16 ft from his TV so I can't speak to anything further..."
R3HCUCSBBO4J65,1,Didn't work
RVVM5ILIX692F,4,Great product. Sometimes there's alot of interference but I live in Manhattan so that's probably why. The bass is a little anemic but otherwise they're worth the money.
R1984EQR0U4A8O,4,I am very happy with them!
RTN3XM8SLTTQV,4,"These are decent/basic headphones. They are painless in terms of set up. You plug up, adjust the tuning knob and go. The charging dock is flawless, and the battery life seems quite solid. My only complaint would be that the sound quality for gaming is a bit underwhelming. Especially if you are used to Turtle Beach. They don't sound &#34;bad&#34;. They just don't give you that immersive/surround sound quality. They will get the job done though, and they are very reliable thus far. I'd say these would be a better purchase if you were interested in affordable wireless options for television listening. It would be a great buy for a grandparent who was hard of hearing or something along those lines. Another positive is that they're extremely comfortable compared to some phones. Not too heavy or tight. They're worth the price. I just wish the sound quality was a tiny bit more full and dynamic. It is clear as a bell though. It's not muddy or hard to distinguish sounds. I'd say keep modest expectations in terms of sound quality, and you won't be disappointed. High marks for ease of use, reliability, and comfort."
R2VHLCGLXO3L01,5,Love them
RFPHKH4DV86EA,5,My wife bought this for me so she could sleep when I was still up. I love them! They self charge on stand and the sound is great. Easy to install. Even if you're slow when it comes to electronics.
R10OG7QJZROS6D,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones showed up yesterday (2/27/2015) and I installed them today.  As usual, I set them up then read the manual to see if I missed anything.  The only thing that was unclear is the position of the earphones on the stand for recharging.  They work great, the sound is very good and volume adjustable.  Tuning is much better than the old earphones we used before.  There is apparently a wide band on the tuning circuit and it appears very stable.<br /><br />Now when my hard of hearing wife wants to watch TV the house remains quiet and I don't have to retreat to my office for peace and quiet.  I guess you could say that the earphones brought us closer together"
R2ZITWR9JVIGEY,4,Little trouble with the ears when I but battery in ..Seem to be o k now thought I'd. Have to call bet working now ...Love the swift delivery...TY Bonni844.bd@gmail.com
RI02WYYODAQRO,5,Great set for any couple that has overlapping sleep routines.  No more waking up to the midnight scary movies!
RDPLXAM30AGCR,5,"Great Product. These headphones are great quality, comfortable and very good sound."
R2MEYBYCJCQRM2,5,Works great.  Easy to use.
R18MCA3GRZGSIN,5,"My husband is very hard of hearing. In order to hear conversations on TV, he had to have the volume so loud that it hurt my ears. We tried lesser quality headphones, but they were not satisfactory, I love that these are rechargeable."
RJGS25ERCKJ1,5,Worked fine
R3DYUCNSKXDHBN,5,great headphones.
RZHIFWJ8VP1U5,5,"Great quality, great sound. My dad and grandmother love these and if I could afford a pair for myself I would buy in a heartbeat."
R21XWJQOHDXTTL,4,"Headphones came in a timely manner, sound quality is great and they last before recharging more than any other headphones purchased by us in the past. Price was great!!!!"
R3R44T9M9F9N80,1,"This item has been THE WORST purchase I've made on amazon. I've replaced he batteries four times now, and each time they have corroded. The length of time passed has varied, but have always corroded. I could understand if the batteries went dead, but not corroded.  I am not at all satisfied, but the cost was $60.00. I don't have money to throw away like that."
R11BH3BRM0T7ZQ,5,great for tv
R2JTMJY1YQXLB5,4,Very good quality.  The only problem is that it appears to have a very distinctive bass output that makes some voices difficult to understand.
R21PXL7DCO25XN,3,"The receiver part on the headset is adjustable for some reason and there is a separate volume control adjustment.  Both controls of spin dial construction with the frequency spin dial located just beneath the volume control spin dial which makes it easy for the user to adjust one when they really wanted to adjust the other.  Users first have to tune or adjust the frequency spin control dial.  Than the volume control spin dial.  I don't know if my headset is defective or not but the volume seems to vary while I'm listening even after it seems I properly adjust both dials. This can be very annoying.  However, I am really impressed with the range...I've used the frequency adjustment to I assume crank up the output and can hear well beyond  300 feet down the hill  outside my house which is wonderful.  Pretty impressive as my two story home is of all block construction.  My old Sony cordless head phones only worked to just outside the house, and even that was spotty."
R2MHRR1YN73OQU,5,"Should have gotten these years ago!  I live with other people and it is really nice to be able to actually hear my movies and TV shows!  Before I always strained to hear the words people were saying, and it annoyed the others that I had the TV turned up so high."
RZWX0K6DFJGDY,5,Fantastic ear phones.  I use them to watch television because I am nearly deaf.  Excellent sound quality.  I just purchased a second pair.  First pair are still working perfectly after seven years.
R3NL2HX08QYBT,5,High quality wireless headphones. I really enjoy using these. The sound quality is much better than the pair I replaced.
R2EA81N9W66B8O,3,bulky-it falls off easily and there is no easy way to turn them on or off so you can hear in the room or privately otherwise good for the money
R952KGAYWS8RQ,5,"Excellent sound quality. I can continue listening to my program while I take a bathroom break, or get something to eat. I even had to go outside to make sure my dogs weren't getting into trouble, and I didn't miss a word of O'Reilly's interview."
R2J2KC30JDNGK0,3,Unfortunately these headphones suddenly ceased to work after six months.
RHYIBPHLED3S9,5,These things are super comfortable and sound great for TV and movies. My wife uses them at night so I don't have to listen to her watching Mob Wives.
R15MBH601GUD8V,4,the rs120 at this time works as good as i hoped it would perform
R257WNDSXHNJSQ,2,"Radio frequency? What year is this? Give me bluetooth.<br /><br />I just couldn't get it working and didn't like the idea of &#34;tuning&#34; it to a channel that works. It didn't work with my new LG HDTV, maybe I wasn't patient enough.<br /><br />It worked fine with my iPhone but that's not really the purpose.<br /><br />It's kind of bulky and not that sexy. It does look really cool sitting next to your TV though."
R3B4EY4PCHNGDU,5,These are a great head phones are great they work very well.Better then I expeted them to work for the price.
R4KQX22MWLV92,5,Works great but a little large when laying on your side on the couch.  Good quality and range for what we use it for.
R7VI110JRUB5J,5,"I bought these to watch TV in bed while my wife sleeps.  They work great!  The sound is great, they are comfortable, and the rechargeable batteries will last for quite a while.  I recharge mine about once a week or so, and I use the headphones for usually an hour or two each night.  I love them so much, I bought a pair for my mom."
R1TT4BR1QGAYAI,4,"I purchased these for my husband who loves the tv loud. They're clear and work very well. The only issue that I've found is that they have a delay, so if I'm sitting next to him on the couch I can hear the tv then his head phones, which gets very annoying. Other than that they are perfect."
R3DEC0SDMNOHOJ,1,"Among the reviewers, everyone raved about this item, but the headphones I got were clearly defective: they could not stay tuned very long.  After less than an hour of use, the static would begin, and they had to be laboriously readjusted.  We thought that it was a &#34;breaking in&#34; problem, and patiently kept readjusting, but after a week or so of trying to get them to work properly, we had enough and sent them back."
R1AUYEAEYMX720,5,"I had my doubts about this product , when I first  hooked it  up . Had  a cable connection issue no picture  at first ( Older LCD TV) change the  HDMI port an solved that. Went to hook these up an got static , advice  from a friend said run it off the cable  box audio to back of  TV then to too  Sennheiser sending unit , So went to radio shack an bought a  6 component connect red an black  piggy  back adapter cable , has  2  connections  for cable box audio,  two  for back of TV audio an then on the same connector picky back females to connect to sending unit  by Sennheiser , Very pleased! too bad  some cannot share  the same happiness as in my  other half  as I bought two head sets ."
R1L6OFMQXTTA5I,4,Good purchase with reasonable price.
R365GJOIHJ7CCF,4,It's OK but has static sometimes
R24HI03HT7FCDA,4,It's good in that it doesn't requite new batteries every day. But the tuner needs adjusting often.
R6116HON0AUBH,4,Work like a charm! Only complaint is that they are a little bulky and could fit a little better but that is minor.
RKKGSXN9JEZS9,5,Excellent purchase.  Price was right.  Sound quality superb.  Great product.
R1DL7XR60U76I7,1,The first set we ordered worked off and on so we thought there was a short and returned them for a new set.  These work barely but there is so much static you can seldom understand the TV.  DON'T ORDER THESE
R2JPAQHLFGWYJ0,4,"I love this item...only thing I would change is to make them fit a little tighter, they tend to fall off if you bend over to pick something up...the reception is great...I can go all over my house and still crystal clear nice sound.  They work great with my laptop and television!!"
R3C2JW9I0SNU2W,1,"It was working fine very beginning, but it stop working at all now. Within One month it become dead."
R1RHMQ6XJHALIQ,5,Very clear and easy to use.
R20OLSXA9P8QRU,2,They only lasted about a year and suddenly stopped working. I would not recommend for the price.
R1TMVAEE0OR4M5,4,"These actually work quite well.  When I first got them I immediately tried them but got static.  After I charged the batteries as directed, they worked clearly and with good fidelity.  One earpiece has a tuning control on it so that you can tune to a clear signal as you would on a non-digital radio.  The headphones feel just a little tight but they are fine and I can listen for two or three hours without a problem.  I appreciate the quality sound over ear-buds.  I think you will like them and I would recommend them."
R2LIDMIC68RP7C,4,Great quality but bluetooth is better
R87XSL74MWNQZ,5,Really good sound quality and nice features.
RU63W9DUBEZ50,5,its a execelent produc need to get a digital to analog converter raishan mod #do3k from amazon to work properly  easy setup  comes w/every thing
R6A8CJ0XJBGTT,5,Hook up to TV was beyond me. Thankfully I had read a previous review and read you could hook up to the cable box. Did that. Couldn't be happier with phones now.
R2UEMLLC9BE3UA,4,bought for grandfather who cannot hear the tv too well without making everyone else in the home deaf. works well but he says they feel bulky and heavy to him but sounds great to him
R2D1XHXI9Z6Q9B,5,This was a replacement purchase for a them same item that got broken. Fulfills my needs and being hearing impaired they saves my marriage when we watch TV
R3KLOU4JDHFKCV,5,The wireless ears are all that we hoped for! No more battle over the volume on the TV. I can listen at night without disturbing the rest of the family.
R2D55DGJ4O2P20,1,"It was not as good as I though, is was hard to keep the battery's to keep in the ear side of the unit, it keep on to remove { the ear pad } from the main unit , that is why I sent them back.. stu. C."
R1COYT9RJB1327,3,"Works fine, good sound, but awkward to have to tune channel and to position on charger. Also, not as comfortable as my previous comparable Song\y headphones"
R1BHL044NAK350,3,Doesn't work very distant from TV. Very disappointed. Certainly doeasn't work through my internal sliding glass door - seems to get interference from the frame. Very disappointed - does not have the range as advertised.
R39SP7HQTM1EXA,4,"Took a bit to get it set up as the instructions were a little confusing for me. Even had to google the 'How-to' video. The tuning also took a bit trial and error - for the longest there was a lot of noise feedback if I moved a bit \\""out-of-range\\"". But when I finally got it tuned correctly, the quality of the sound was superb!  I use the headset to watch TV while he plays his games. With this headset, I barely hear any external noises except for my show. As for the battery life, can't really attest but I can definitely watch four episodes of Games of Thrones with no issue.<br /><br />Love the easy charging dock and the sleek design."
R1Z8W79J9I5UEF,3,"Positives are that it feels good on my head, easy to load onto charger. Negatives are that it has a slight hum even when playing TV sound, requires me to &#34;tune&#34; the headset with a dial like an old radio, have to turn it off and on at the headset. I had a headset by different manufacturer that was easier to set up and did not hum. I will keep it because it was cheaper, but not completely satisfied."
R2KUNMT3S6S5RY,4,System works great for me and I have a profound hearing loss.  Only problem is that the headset is fine sitting still but is loose enough that I can not keep it in place if trying to move around while wearing it.  Just a minor problem.
R1KCK93NRZTOQZ,4,"Have 2 in the household and works great.  Comfortable to wear, easy adjustments but with the 2 an infrequent cross over of sound and then need to reset the frequency location."
R1DJPCLBYU07A6,5,Purchased for a birthday gift for a teenager. Great quality and work perfectly. He is very happy with them!
R2QUIBZU4NCSRG,3,"Not completely satisfied. Earphones start buzzing if one pauses the TV but doesn't turn off the earphones. Also, if one goes in the next room to get a glass of water, for example, the earphones start buzzing and audio ceases; again, have pause the TV and turn off earphones if moving very far from the TV ."
R32EFDIVSZPRJB,5,These are very good headphones. They are clear with no back ground buzz as some I read about. They are convenient to charge and easy to use. The range of hearing is amazing. They are adjustable and very comfortable covering the ear and cancelling most all noise.
RKNXBDSCQ95WY,4,Good
RJMSOHCV0360H,5,Great product and seller.
RBHPR22D5L0TP,5,"This is the practical.solution to watching TV without bothering others nearby. The headphones are lightweight, yet very comfortable. Sound quality is superb over a much greater range than bluetooth sets. For the price they are hard to beat and recharge on the stand when not in use. For $70 these are great."
R2ERMRCWYQ3E5R,5,"Ah, finally I can get to sleep at a decent hour and my retired wife can watch tv until the sandman visits her! Easy to hook up,and work as advertised. Goodnight."
RCUFGC0CAB01O,5,Have tried this item both my wife and I think it is great and improves our hearing watching T V.<br />Highly recommend this product and company to every one watching T V and listening to music.
R16O75RDNW8VRX,5,Not easy hook up but the sound is wonderful and tech assistance is fantastic.  I purchased for my husband who has a hearing problem and now we can all watch TV without the sound turned up
R3VJYY1BGVAIYQ,2,"Sound came in and out  ! Charger inferior. Love the company, I'll try another."
R2I7KSEX1QGHW6,5,"works well, great sound"
R3I3EZYI66R7AH,4,I have hearing problems especially while watching movies on TV.  These worked great.  I bought a second pair for my wife and recommended them to a friend.  He bought a pair and also loves them.  Recommend them for anyone with hearing problems.  We can now watch movies on TV and not miss anything.
R14LZ0CYV995Y0,5,Just exactly what we needed.  A second pair so we could both listen.
R2GRKGK5KKUWX5,5,my wife loves that I can watch tv without bothering her late at night. the sound is good and the charger is super easy. at first when I unpacked it I thought the adapter to plug in the audio was missing but it was taped into the box under a flap.
R2H08V723JNE28,3,I have a pacemaker.  the instructions say not to use with a pacemaker.  should make this clear in product description
R2A0A8Z4FP364K,5,great item.Will order again
R2E3IM8LK97YMV,5,For my mom who likes the T.V. really loud. Works great!
R1038WL8111NT4,5,Great sound! Very comfortable!
R1E03ICA6MI41X,5,Great!
R3CM14RN83RF95,5,Hubby is going hard of hearing and these work great. I can now listed to music or TV without blasting the sound. He can go into the kitchen or bathroom and even outside and still not miss a thing. Best buy I ever made for him.
R37R0XUHA6YL01,4,"I like Sennheiser products, these are very good quality wireless headphones."
R1YUK39456BAJ1,5,"I've had these headphones for at least five years and use them for hours every day.  Since my hearing is much poorer than my wife's, these headphones enable us to watch TV together at volumes comfortable for each of us.  The sound quality is excellent.  Also, I can go to our mailbox outdoors and 100' away and still hear the TV.  These use RF (radio frequency) transmission rather than IR (infrared) so you don't have to maintain a line of sight path between the headphones and the transmitter to maintain reception."
R142Y0UU80ZA18,5,"Sounds great, but you must push the earpiece extensions back in place when you return it to the charging stand, if not the headset will not make proper contact on the metal bars to recharge. I hope Sennheiser finds a remedy for  this like making the charging surface flat and wider in stead of round and thin."
R3KX037RH7INTX,4,Very good sound and comfortable. Transmits through hole house.
R2HMI3M9F4UHNV,5,Good quality.  Sounds great!
R1H1Q7B09W5EY5,5,"We have had one of these for years for the husband to watch TV programs I don't enjoy.  So now, I bought another for my programs on Youtube and Netflix.  Great for listening to music also.  We'll never go back to the Bluetooth headsets again with their limited life batteries."
R23YLEWHKH4786,1,"Very uncomfortable as they set on you ears rather than cup them which also makes them slip and fall of your head with little movement of your head, especially forward tilt. Lot of static between programs. Often drifts off frequency requiring readjustment."
R2FQMNGFY6R5F,2,"I got them for a senior who is not good with tech-y things, and they were too fussy and hard for her to use.  Plain old cheap headphones--even if the sound isn't good---would have been a better solution.  As things happened though, I just moved out and I'm happy."
R1JNC66LYSEWE1,5,These are great.My husband can hear the tv .My husband can put the volume down for me but he can hear it with his head I phones.The best.
R2ECQOAUWN6G3O,5,"We love these headphones!  They work great, easy to set up and serve its purpose of not disturbing the sleeping spouse.  Highly recommended!"
R32Z5G701G55G1,4,My husband is partially deaf and these headphones allow him to hear his tv programs clearly.  This is the 3rd pair we have bought for him and we would recommend them to anyone.
R34RWFKY2644AA,5,"Bought these as replacement pair for RCA wireless phones that I've worn out; earcups falling apart. The sound is superb, volume range fantastic, and the batteries are lasting for several weeks on a charge; I've been hanging them on my bedside and forgetting to put them on the charging cradle; they finally ran down after three weeks; 4 hours of charging, and they're good to go again."
RU4WMMI8HJ5XR,2,Uncomfortable.  Sudden loud and annoying statics come through when videos finish playing.
R101BGD9APWWZX,4,"These do just what I'd hoped! My husband can now watch the news (even walking around outside our home!), while I retain my bliss not having to listen!"
R17A1Q350I84V8,5,Clean sound with great fidelity.
R3ITPFJXV0L5E6,5,"My husband refuses to admit that his hearing isn't what it used to be so he raises the volume on the TV to uncomfortable levels. When he uses these, he can hear and understand everything and I can enjoy watching with him. Sometimes we even mute the TV and I can sit in the same room reading. These might have saved my marriage!"
R6QZ463OEHM6X,1,"A waste of money and a source of frequent frustration beginning the first time I used them.  Typical performance was they worked fine for a few minutes and, without notice, break into loud static with no return to &#34;normal?&#34; until turned off for several hours.  The design concerns listed by others are not a major issue with me because, when they worked , they met all my expectations.  Even though they are eligible for warranty repairs, I believe it will be spending more money to fix something that Sennheiser will say is normal.  I guess it is normal since there are 665 other customers who agree that they wasted their time and money too by trusting the name that had a good reputation."
R9G202HRJXRWC,4,Very nice.  Good sound.
R4D79RS86SHBR,2,I could not get this item in sync with my TV.
R1VRGXZZ5H3L7U,3,"I purchased a set of these headphones about 4 years ago and they had better ear cups. Everything about this newer version (ear cups, switches, case) is cheaper but they do work. You just have to fiddle with the settings to get good sound"
R30LDAAA61XI6L,5,great!
R2IEP71BH43U8X,4,"We already own one, so this was an additional set.  Exactly as stated."
REF33237EOKZI,5,Easy and works really well like the price
R33FE2NK6KBICA,1,"Has a lot of bass distortion at high volumes and a constant hiss from the tuner not working as well as it should. I can use them for gamin, I suppose but I can't use them at all for music at higher volumes like I intended."
R1DMIF6ZKI4NG6,5,"They work very well, I watch tv at my volume, even when everyone else is sleeping. Easy to install, they fit well, batteries stay charged even when I forget to return them to the cradle for a couple days."
R2JAO5L2K1AF58,5,"Love the headphones, work great and good reception."
RWTRQWPFJO0RH,3,"I bought these for the sole purpose of watching stuff on my computer so that I didn't have to either watch what my bf is watching on TV, or so I didn't make him put up with what I wanted to watch.  I wanted to go wireless because I have a large enough computer screen to not sit 3 feet away from it.  This works for what I need.<br /><br />**Pros**<br />--Wireless:  I haven't tried going too far from the 'receiver' but I was able to go probably about 25 feet away without losing the connection<br />--Okay sound, but nothing special<br /><br />**Cons**<br />--The Hiss or static.  It's almost always there, no matter how close you are to the receiver or no matter how much you fine tune it.  it's not always horribly noticeable, but there are some times when it can be, depending on your ability to drown out white noise.<br />--They are huge.  I can't lie down, even just to rest my head back on the pillow without these getting in the way.<br />--The 'receiver' has to be plugged in to an outlet, and the audio source has to be plugged into the receiver.  This limits where I can go with my laptop, and it can make it difficult to move elsewhere on a whim (having to unplug and untangle the cords...etc.)<br /><br />Overall, depending on your need, these work. If you're looking for flexibility or moveability (is this a word?) then these aren't for you."
R139YCQ1MMKHQ5,2,"does not stay on ones head if you move about and the ear cups are not comfortable, the 170 is a much better product"
R3IYFC9003EA1Z,5,"This is our second Sennheiser earphone.  No, the first one purchased about 2 years ago is still going strong.  My wife loved my earphone so much that she had to have one of her own.  She also loves her earphone.  I have not tried any other make, but friends have and they ageree that this earphone is the best on the market that we have found."
R29EELQWPR3BX0,5,"Idea, even when used with another headset in the same room."
R29R7DIUX35OJK,5,We own four sets of these.  They work great and I don't get the same ear fatigue that I do for headphones that go over my ears.
R16H3CJH4E6LRH,5,"I bought this for my friend who is a little hard of hearing and he complains about not being able to hear the TV even though the volume is blasting. It's very easy to set up and like all other rechargeable products you do have to wait a day before using so don't expect to plug and play immediately. I agree with some of the other reviews that there is a slight hiss even at ten to fifteen feet away from the receiver but I'm not the one wearing it so that's not a negative for me. That being said the sound is very good and the earphones are comfortable. The sound on the TV stays on even with the headphones turned on. The volume, on off, and tuner are on the headphones themselves. Even though I don't need them and I bought them for someone else, I'm considering buying these for myself. The price is good for the quality of what you're getting. You can pay $100 more for the better ones but if you're not a sound quality guru these work just fine."
R3RH09083BMNVE,4,"good quality, excellent battery life for the headphones. recommended"
RGYN0ITRNIOT6,5,great product!
R3T46I3OHB3BKF,5,Work  very good at long distance
R2RCJ97D2VEJ8P,2,"Great sound, maybe too great expectations. It did lose tuning occasionally and after about 10 days of use it died for good. I gave up on the idea, went bluetooth instead - returned it."
R3J0RFN8JP61NR,5,I use these while on the treadmill to watch TV.  I didn't want to blast the TV to the level needed to hear over the treadmill.  These work perfectly and I love that they are rechargeable.  Sound is very clear.  At first it took a few adjustments to get the &#34;channel&#34; right.  Sometimes need to adjust dial to get best sound connection.
RIKQ61R1MQ6YC,2,I wanted these for an elderly hard of hearing woman but they didn't work for her. Probably not a very good person to try them on.
R1OKOCJPXAVDO4,5,These are very nice headphones. They have a good sound quality and the wireless works well.
RCOCQ83NFDT94,5,Excellent value
R2DG2KNFWHVR32,1,worked for three months
R1CXUC92VMH42F,1,Would not work!  Poor Quality Control at Plant??
RAYR0VA0UK6EO,5,I have 2 pair -- one for the living room and one for the bedroom... Work fantastic and produces a very clear stereo-like sound
R3S1SBEKGUH722,5,"we got this for our hearing impaired parents and it works wonderfully!  The sound clarity is amazing.  Easy to use and set up.  Although I don't have hearing issues, I'm tempted to get one!  Thought about getting the more expensive model but no need.  This works great!!"
R3TRG8J67UEBE3,5,Excellent! We Love this!
RVBGC1T5Q9O9P,5,Husband loves this!
R3CR8DNZXS3YWW,5,thanks for great item.
R2JUJU20TFH43Y,5,"This is an excellent product. Delivery time, price and usefullness. Great sound,  rechargable battery life after over a year of use, excellent. I use these headphones every single day. I liked them so much I now have two pair. Perfect to keep peace in the family for TV volume or if you are a late night listener....again..... only you can hear without disturbing others sleeping. I can highly recommend these headphones."
RHKBLGXOEACHK,3,"I have a later version of these headphones that fit much more comfortably, but I bought these as extras since the price was much lower. The fit isn't that great or comfortable, and I hate the channel find thing. I wanted it to just pick up audio from the PC that it is plugged into, but instead I have to turn dials and listen to static like trying to find a channel on a radio."
R1NYN49I4GA3OW,4,"this item performs way better than TV ears, which is what i used until now , and it costs less than TV ears. i didn't give it 5 stars because they don't fit tightly enough on my head. otherwise , i am very happy with this product."
R11QQ8YXL2OR5,3,"So far the Sennheiser RS120 has worked very well, had some initial problems with it turning off but the company website allowed it to be fixed."
R39XBAWP4SP58Z,1,"I purchased the headphones in December 2013 and they lasted until January 2015. When they worked, they worked great. When they didn't work, they didn't work at all. Don't waste your time with this product or company. Find headphone that don't automatically require an adapter to plug or expensive replacement batteries."
R27O8Q74J0W3TI,4,"Well designed, worth the money."
RUUSI5GI1OAR2,5,Ready to go just plug in and listen made it so mother in law can listen without  blasting the rest of us out. Can even mute the tv out and she can listen. Great. Had to put tape over volume know so she wouldn't change it while placing on her head.
R1T1Z86S69CNRQ,5,These are fantastic.  They were my Christmas present and I can hear everything now.  Cars sound like they are driving from one ear to the other. Great sound and clarity.
R35FGYZL8KV53Y,5,Great set of head phones I use them often and haven't had any issues with them
R30Y7EY7C5ZOCV,5,"I bought these for my wife so she could watch TV over the noise of the rowing machine.  Set up was very easy and we had it up and running in minutes. The sound quality is excellent  and the headphones are very comfortable.  They fit snuggly even while rowing quite vigorously!  Others mention a hissing sound.  I only noticed this when there was no sound and the room was silent.  Certainly not a distraction while using the phones. If your looking for the best sound you've ever experienced, you're looking in the wrong price range.  However, I watched a Muse concert while rowing and the bass and treble coming out of the phones was excellent.  Great product!"
RYKOWR0ANG5LU,5,My nephew was very pleased with the headphones I gave him for Christmas!! He thinks they are excellent in quality and sound.
R170KIWFTIQVOH,2,"Not good enogh for the price, size and brand. Audio with to much noise."
RWOG1JGK8X6ZN,5,Able to move around house and not miss dialogue. Great for listening to music on Sirius.
R1LN0IUBG1DSIH,5,GREAT SOUNDING HEADPHONES AT A NICE PRICE!!!!!!
R2U87QPM3UB3OX,1,Not working send back
RTLH9OB6MJMJA,1,I bought two of these. One worked fine but the other came with a faulty plug.
R1XJ28B8HIWVIG,1,This product does not work. The initial sound quality is fantastic but the battery life lasts perhaps 20 minutes and then you get a whirring static that will blow your eardrums out. I've even made sure that the charging light is on in that the product is fully charged when we go to use it. I totally do not recommend this product.
R1R3OGVVXFI4PX,5,The very best!
R1CEAGJZ6A78ZJ,5,"These headphones are great. I can hear the music soundtrack during and make out most of the dialog. I only have one good ear and that one needs a hearing aid. But, with these phones I don't use the aid."
R2LN0B9I3QS7W1,4,"Update, I have had these for about 1 1/2 years and the left side stopped working. I will order another set. I really like these other than they do tend to slip around on your head. I am over half deaf and these are great for some one who has hearing problems but you will need to get better foam on the headphones."
R92OVMECVG2TQ,4,Works great!  The headset is a little large for my head.
ROFAAGOHL8GGF,4,This is overall a great product.  I bought these for my husband so he could watch TV while I enjoy some peace and quiet!
R2FI34DOYSEF4N,5,Works well can hear the TV and what is being said now
R3NCBYYUSYF7DB,5,"Bought this as a gift. She really likes it. Great audio and range, typical Sennheiser quality. The charging dock is really cool."
R1P4N7C1Z42Y5N,1,"These were impossible for an older person to work with and configure. The sound cut in and out, wouldn't work at times, and was not easy to use, hard enough that the recipient gave up on them and gave them back to me. Nothing but trouble."
R1Y4NZTZV0EO7A,3,"A tight fit on the head (unless you are a child or have a narrow head). Nowhere near as comfortable as most other wired headphones in this price range.<br />However, it works, sounds decent for the price, and the open-design ear cup allows ventilation and hearing other things in the room.<br />The plug adapters are handy, but I wish there was a right-angle on the quarter-inch.  I really have to push my amp back into the recesses of my entertainment center in order to get the door closed."
R36S8MR8R5TDIU,1,I tried everything. couldn't get headphones to work.
RKF8IERE2WWTB,5,Easy setup and the sound clarity is surprisingly good.  My wife loves her Christmas present because she can catch all the dialogue now!
R2ZN5X04J0IT31,1,Tuner nob poor design  head set slides off when I move  I had a Sony prior to this and it fit firmly and tuner was a three point switch
R38Y2QLTLOTL7D,5,found out it was not compatible with blue ray but had to get a device to make it work all is good now.
REJDSTOJU0URY,2,Headphones have annoying background hiss all the time.
R27CU4QXZ3LRXA,1,"I was actually shocked by how poor these headphones were. Firstly they are old technology. Any pair of Bluetooth headphones would, for the most part, blow away RF signal headphones. There are some exceptions with the way more expensive RF headphones but these are literal junk. I'm an audio engineer and very familiar with sennheiser products. I've used them in sessions a lot. Secondly the material of the headphones is very cheap even for plastic. This includes the charging station which looks like seriously aged technology made 30 years ago. The performance of the headphone was even worse. Frequency response was solely based on what channels you used and out of the three channels your only choice was either pure static or a significant buzz just underneath whatever audio you were listening to. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone."
R3TRDHNBAG54TU,5,These headphones are perfect.  They allow me to watch tv without waking my partner.  It is exactly what I was looking for.
R332I7JSSS2ZV5,5,Very good.
R3LLXAZ8DNHOFL,4,Very Pleased. Beats turning the volume way up!!!
RRBFCKELQLBXF,1,"These probably work like they are supposed to, but my mistake was not reading one sentence. These are NOT bluetooth enabled."
R2FADYHUSBZW21,4,Worked pretty good but has some static.
R2QOLQAEP6ZLXF,5,they are the best
R1057WMIO2638V,5,"Great wireless headphones , plugged them in the headphone jack in my onkyo hometheatre receiver and didnt even have to fiddle tuning them in,  they worked right away no static no hiss, sounds good , pretty comfortable wearing them , my ears dont get got or sweaty"
R1ARBI70IYC3GD,1,Bought this product more than a month ago but the right headphone never worked. Only the left one worked after a lot of tuning. Does not seem to be a very reliable product to buy. I wish I could return this product but I guess it is too late now.
R3VQK1QJXU5G9V,5,"I bought these for my mother-in-law (who has hearing problems) and when I tried them, I had to buy a pair for myself. The sound quality is amazing!"
R3QISNEOM312GJ,5,I'd be lost without them.  Hearing aids alone were not enough to enable me to clearly hear some of the mumbles and whispers on todays TV.
RKBFWK8TX5EM2,5,"Excellent fidelity!  Plenty loud.  Bought this for a hearing-impaired friend for watching TV.  Works great.  I wish that the tuning knob were located away from the volume knob, so that it would be less likely to be de-tuned."
R2WHNE02CWN6ME,5,Works very well for my Father with hearing loss. He's very particular and likes these very much.
R2PHFCIQ2T4SLZ,5,You feel like you are at the movies.  The sound is clear.  BEST purchase ever!!!!  I would buy these again.  Much better than I ever expected.
R1OF8WTB1FLW9M,5,"I purchased these headphones for my wife.  She has a slight hearing deficiency and these headphones more than compensate for her problem.  I also have a set of the same headphones.  When we watch a movie on TV, all of the sound is captured and there is no more of the &#34;What did he/she say?&#34;"
RPJX93FMXO54,5,"Wonderfu!  I got them so my wife could watch the late movies and not disturb everyone and they worked beyond expectation.  Not only do they work great for her, my mother-in-law (who is 89) uses them for her soap operas and we don't have to listen to that drivel.  I walked down the street, about 80 yards from my house, with them on and still could listen to the program on the television.  Great quality and price.  I would recommend to anyone."
R9A0IWPHCNJAW,5,My new favorite thing!
R1R0BK1NCEKL5J,5,"Father-in-law loves these headphones.  He is an elderly gentleman that wanted a comfortable set of headphones that would allow him to watch television while his wife was asleep.  He is not a audiophile and neither am I.  The headphones provide you with a quality wireless sound at a reasonable value.  As an added bonus, got these for a fantastic deal during Amazon's Christmas Sales."
R4W8UH09HB0Z5,1,Broke in less than a month of use.  Bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's completely no functional.  Don't buy this headset!!
R3HAZ0RHMXXGZY,1,"Complete piece of crap headphones.  Of the the thousand or so things i have purchased on Amazon over the years, this item is the biggest piece of junk ever. The headphones are super light and feel like ten-dollar headphones. The plug to plug them is hidden on the device and its difficult just to get the device powered on. The directions for setup are horrible. The help link they refer you to is a website error page. Is this company still in business? The youtube instructional page is insanely stupid. Get this, the youtube set up video asks you to make a phone call to the TV manufacturer...are you kidding me?!  The instructions do not show how to power the device on!  Or where the batteries go.  Why skip all these steps!  You will get so frustrated trying to set these up.  It took me an over an hour just to set up these &#34;wireless&#34; headphones.  The power stand is not wireless, it must be located (wired) to your tv and also into a power outlet, and both wires they supplied are short.  So if you have a nice expensive flatscreen on the wall like i do, with the wires hidden, this thing creates two new wires hanging from the back of the tv.  What I'm trying to say is the stand & its wires look awful, and cheap. I regret this purchase. The worst."
R13T3D0P9SRPQ4,5,Gave to my father as a gift and he says he loves the sound quality and lightness.  Jury is still out on battery life.
R2U6NP9VXA22CE,5,"Love this brand and have extra headphones to use off the same charger.  Easy to use, great sound and you can adjust the volume while you are wearing them to find your own comfort level.  Be sure to have full contact between the headphones and the charger, so the light comes on, and you know you are in the charge mode."
R37GNYGI2CLHKN,5,"Wow, great headphones!  I had previously purchased a Bluetooth adapter and some less than spectacular headset so I could listen to my TV solo but the result was me back again looking for another solution.  I did a bit of research (ok, now I did a LOT more research) and I came across these headsets.  Seemed like it was everything I would need and then some.  Easy to work, easy to recharge, long range, no direct line of site needed and I could add multiple headphones if so desired.<br /><br />Out of the box they couldn't be easier to setup.  After an extremely impatient wait for the headphones to fully charge (I had to say that last part, do you think I really waited for them to charge?) I popped them on, tuned the dial and wallah, perfect sound!  The sound really is much better with the headphones.  I had read a review where someone said they would wear the headphones even if they didn't have to and I now understand why.  The stereo interaction, for someone who just has TV speakers, is amazing.  The sound is rich and full, it doesn't chop off highs or lows and there's no issue controlling the volume from a whisper to a roar (last solution's problem in a nutshell, only roar, no whisper).<br /><br />About the range.  No worries!  I'm halfway across my house and I'm still picking up static free sound. I'm not sure who has a living room so large that they need headsets with this kind of range but it has it.  99% of the time I'm within 20 feet of my TV but it's nice to know when I have to run for something on the other side of the house and I forget I'm wearing the headset I can still listen to commercials!<br /><br />Oh, and I love the charging stand.  Just drop them on and they're charging no plugs to hook up and no base that you have to wiggle them around to make proper contact (yes, I'm talking about you my Sony IR headphones!).<br /><br />Lastly, how they feel.  Extremely comfortable.  They have soft padding on the top and the ear cushions don't push my ears flat.  Ican wear them all night and not even notice.  That being said, they're not exactly small.  (Don't look at yourself in the mirror unless you need a laugh!)  Neither my wife or I have had any issues wearing them except if she wants to lean the side of her head up against the couch.  But then again, not what they were designed for exactly.<br /><br />I love this headset, I use it all the time and would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs such a solution."
R2IPZL9XFJ6OE5,3,"I guess the sound quality was adequate, but i only had the option of using the headphone jack on my receiver. Since i have all my component's HDMI connections going through my receiver and then TV i didn't have a lot of options on how to connect these. It didn't make much sense to get up and plug it into the receiver every time i wanted to use it. Ended up returning it.<br /><br />Not sure if this was more an issue with the headphones or the receiver, so i went with three stars."
R3W1GPBCHNU3ZY,4,very good sound quality and very comfortable!
R3AGZ3I57M6KSQ,3,"Nice looking unit, well made, but seems to always have that static or hissing sound going on in the background.  There are multiple frequency settings and a dial to zero in on them but the constant static sound is annoying.  Have heard about this issue with many of the wireless headphones.  Hoping it wasn't going to be an issue-but??.  Tried moving the transmitter to several different locations to reduce any electronic interference.  The sound is clear and crisp, but the constant hissing or static, well I have to take them off its so annoying"
R242QWGEIMFZNU,5,Very good.  I recommend it to anyone in need of a bit of extra sound and clarity!
R146X15RML6OLY,4,"Hard to dial in clarity but when you do they work great. Good range, i've gone into my backyard some hundred feet from the base and they still work. Heavy though, I can't lift with them because they slide right off my head when i bend over to pick up a bar. I have a big head but these are still too big.<br /><br />Overall, if you are sitting at your desk or walking around the house doing chores, great."
R3HQTVX0PL76CK,5,Sounds great.Thanks.
R1T6CZIQWIEK8V,5,No complaints. They work as advertised.
RGA1J48X6701E,5,I've been using these headphones for years - this was a replacement for an older pair - and they sure help me... I'm quite hard of hearing and hate to impose my viewing habits on neighbors. It's simply not polite. Great sound discrimination on these headphones and they're comfy to wear for hours on end!
R22RW05FBM778Y,5,"I bought these for my avid gamer husband because his favorite pair had a 20' cord that would trip him whenever he did housework, grabbed a snack, or generally moved about the house. Battery life and ease of are a must in this house and this set fits the bill. Worth every penny!"
R3VXZPZE801P3E,1,No
R21KVRQ8V9LHNX,4,Great for watching TV and not disturb your partner.
R1EWI9P8X65O5O,1,didn't work wouldn't stay on my head
RFMPH0B81TAD3,5,These are the best wireless headphones we have ever owned.  The ear pieces are comfortable even with hearing aids.  Love the way they recharge.  You simply lay them on top of the metal support.  No jacks to plug in.  Highly recommended.
R2ZGU5UGPPRRAA,4,A little too much static for my taste. But will work for late night movie watching while the misses sleeps.
R31XB5OPB3STJL,5,Great headphones.
RQG4559CZDYE1,5,"I love these head phones,  the sound is clear, easy to set up and tune.  My husband can now watch tv while i sleep and he doesnt disturb me."
R3RK2S9AB2M2N9,2,"I have an older model Sennheiser that I have owned for 8 years.  This is not even close to being as good.<br />The Old Sennheiser:  My grand kids got hold of my old headphones now they are taped and only one earpiece puts out sound.  They will work outside my house to retrieve the paper and walk out to my truck a little further away.  I have used them with my weed eater and leaf blower just fine listening to music.<br />The New Sennheiser:  I did not give is a one since is says &#34;I hate&#34; when you check one star.  From day one out of the box these headphones barely work in the room with the base antenna and one earpiece works about 5% of the time.  Forget about walking outside with them, I can barely get to the restroom without losing a solid signal.  Even sitting 12 feet from the base antenna I sometimes have to put the headband to the front of my head to eliminate interference and can tilt my head to get rid of static interference.  The dial that adjust the signal 9 (rheostat switch I believe)  is very touchy and does not hold when you get it dialed in as if the contact is weak.  Don't bump them against the headrest of your chair or you WILL lose your signal with the slightest bump.  Overall I think these are WELL below the quality standards that a reputable company like Sennheiser should allow off the assembly line.  I don't know if they outsourced the manufacture of these to a 3rd world country and allowed substandard components to be used in their production of the headphones.  These are NOT EVEN CLOSE to being the quality of my 8 year old headphones of the same brand.  I didn't send them back only for the fact that they do fit my head better than my old ones and didn't want to jack with them also because my grand kids compromised the fit of the old headphones and got tired of catching them when I went to the toilet.  If you are thinking about buying these, look a little further and find someone who is not putting sub-standard parts in a formerly qualityname.  I am already looking for replacement headphones and won't even sell these to anybody else who would cuss me for selling them some crappy headphones.  If you find a better headphone let me know here!"
R1EO7W2QBO3AOH,5,Amazing! My husband wakes up very early for work thus goes to bed super early. This allows me to watch TV in our room without disturbing him as he sleeps.  The sound quality is great. Such a great buy! I only wish I bought these sooner.
R1T7XJBXYYT08E,5,Very clear - nice recharging stand - can hear it 20-30 ft out of my house.  Nice to walk the dog still hearing the tv
R3RV1KHM3H2HSH,5,my husband liked mine so much we ordered him one also.
R2RGVNFZ6JUOUE,4,Good
RSA4YG6RI772B,4,"They are good, but need to fit more snugly on your head. They fall off too easily.<br />Thank you!"
R2A20AHWCDA4T9,2,"looses signal, tuning must adjust to signal"
R3HLUZLKGEKDTD,1,"I rarely, if ever, return itemsI purchase on Amazon. This was an exception. No matter how hard I attempted to tune these headphones, I never received a clear signal. THere was always static. The docking station was great but the sound quality frustrating and disappointing. I would rate these headphones 1 or 2 out of 5, and have returned them."
R357OEY8XDL1PJ,4,Good analog headphones.
R61DUGEGVVTXF,1,"I liked my headphones a lot, but now I am dissatisfied.  The earphone's left speaker stopped working.  I don't know when -- I don't use them often.  I sent them in but the warranty folks informed me it was 2 yrs and 4 months since purchase, and I  was welcome to buy a new pair for $65.  I find it ridiculous Sennheiser would not keep me as a satisfied customer and maintain or replace these headphones."
R1P6JZDJRLI31T,5,I never knew how much of TV shows and movies I was missing until I got these.  Now no one gets upset because I have the set turned up too much.  I can even walk in the other room and still hear the TV show perfect.
R3HF8B5JHA2JN0,5,Working very good.
RY297ON3ZDOYS,5,"Love these earphones.  My husband can now hear his TV shows and the whole building doesn't have to hear them also.  No kidding, they are a wonderful device.  They were easy to set up.  If I choose to move them fro one TV to another, it is easy, e.g., from living room to bedroom.  The sound is clear (even my husband agrees.  I can turn the TV sound down to nothing, and he can hear it just as loud as he wants.  I wish I had bought these earphone years ago."
RUSNW3ARVRRA1,1,"This product was not what I expected based on the reviews. People were posting about the crystal clear sounds and the amazing base etc. However, I can say that these wireless headphones worked only within a radius of 5 meters and there was GIGANTIC interference with the signal. All the strange noises coming from the transmission were distracting from the music and HARMFUL to my ears!<br />There was no single song that I could listen to without having a loud interference noise in there. I hated these headphones! I returned them, though I gave them a 2 week test with adjusting the signal etc.<br />Important note: If you like listening to loud music and don't want others (e.g. your colleagues) to hear what you are listening to, don't buy these headphones. Even with reduced volume I think 80% of the sound is passed on to the outside!"
R27E3APFS0ACBS,5,"Arrived on time works as specified, easy set up. Took a minute or so to find the right sound setting for me using the controls on head set and took another minute to find the best position for keeping them from slipping on head. Now everything works perfect. Recommend follow instructions and charge batteries per instructions. Very clear sound. I would recommend them and I would buy from this vender again."
R1N3RV4P5XH4FC,3,Not the best quality product and expensive compared with other products. Paying for the name.
R38LONSSTPBKF8,5,good deal
R2LZC7FA9OSMBV,5,very good for night time movie? when family members are slip.
R63P6AGLNL5GF,5,Everything as expected. A++ seller
R2OIL459UQ1TC9,5,"Works very well, although sometimes there is interference in the sound. Have purchased this product twice for both homes."
R1I6XOHX4BNV38,5,"this is the best Ear Headphone i ever bought love them really recommend them much better then tv-ears not even comparable to it,so much more better in evey thing sound is great .surround sound is great i love them don't hesitatebuy them ,"
R3N5A4QFCQ7YGI,5,Excellent sound and they work great.
RUD8E13INKQF4,5,Amazing sound and cool head phones :D
R1T636LIFFYVJV,5,I love these.  I may have to buy a second pair for the other TV!
R30LCXS0TM52FM,3,Not bad for the money.Having to keep the volume up on tv or they turn off is irritating.
R251H5L4F4NSNK,5,These are great work very well incredible long range clear operation.
R2V53GGYC1BAJ5,3,The work well but I am having a hard time adding angle adapters to the TV unit because of the wall bracket.  The adapters are not tuning well for sound.
R3BN9NFKNW7OTG,4,Seems to be working fine.  I like the recharging stand.
R2SIWOY7DYD3TR,5,Great set of wireless headphones.  Nice clear sound even at a distant.  Easy to install.
RPKPSPJEAAL5O,5,"I bought these to watch TV late at night because my wife has to get up at 3 am to go to work, and she was not able to sleep while I watched TV.  The sound quality these headphones provide was a pleasant surprise.  I am definitely more than satisfied with them; my wife wants to get a pair for herself so we can both wear them while watching movies because the sound quality is much better than the TV.  I am not an audiophile, so I cannot nitpick anything about these!"
R1KPV1UTCOUJBT,4,"These headphones work pretty good.  Set up took a little time but you will need an adapter if you don't have audio out on the back of your TV or headphone jack. I have a Roku, so I hooked it up to audio out on that and switch to the audio out on my dvd player. Volume is really good, semi noise canceling and can lay down while watching tv."
R1PUUN1A4J1FE6,5,This is used by my husband but has saved my sanity. He uses it to watch programs he has taped which he normally has to turn up so loud. He hears his programs now much clearer and I don't  have to listen to his programs!
R1DOLXOMJZS8F2,5,I just bought these for my Husband ....when you lose one of your 5 senses it is such a tragedy....these have allowed my Husband to once again enjoy a few of his favorite TV shows......and his favorite Golf....Thank goodness we found these..one of my Husbands friends showed these to him and I ordered them that day and the look on his face when he first put them on was priceless! He can go to the kitchen and get a snack without missing anything....so nice for him not to have to sit there and watch the closed captions .....what freedom for him...I do not know who invented these....I would like to say to them Thank you! What a blessing!
R1U0NYL29S5B8M,5,"The RS120 was easy to hookup to my dvd/vcr, sound quality is good,cradle that earphones rest on and charge on is excellent, headphones feet on head comfortably.  good buy for price paid"
R2IQY4JCX1ZRPB,2,"Sound is good distance is good, but the fit sucks. Headset fall off your head every time you move. I would not get another one. Next time I'll get another Sony."
R33STOZ0SRHZIZ,3,Work very nicely except that sometimes the sound drifts out and needs to be retuned. It certainly helps me hear certain TV programs much more clearly.
RHIMX3IACBTDS,4,I bought this as a Christmas present for one of my sons.  I had one of these for 7 years and always liked it.  I now have an RS180 which is even better.  It is an economical way to have a wireless headphone that is comfortable and performs well.  It may occasionally need an adjustment of the frequency wheel to keep interference away.
R1SIL82B8SSY5J,5,"They are very comfortable, the sound is at least as good as any others I have tried, and the reception is strong enough to even go outside the house with the transmitter inside the house"
R37MSAD5RSUFZR,4,"These work great, & were extremely easy to set up. the previous post cutting these down are ridiculous1 They couldn't be much easier to put on the stand,<br />& I have no problems with interference, or noise. If these are properly tuned to the transmitter, they are very clear."
R2HN56CYSU0QOM,1,What a piece of crap.  Nothing but trouble since day one.  It's a crapshoot whether it works or not.  Would not recommend or buy again.
R17EN9HF9HOBWA,5,works better than I expected
R3E2UWPVADYDCO,5,"Ordered them because we are a bit hard of hearing and couldn't always understand what is being said, especially movies with accents, etc.  Wow we were blown away with the quality.  Like having a new surround sound system. Added benefit, the grandkids can play video games and we don't have to listen. Comfortable, super easy to install. Couldn't be happier"
R1143LN1AYF3E5,5,first-class<br /><br />first-class
R1YPZXYJ0YM704,5,Easy to set up and works great. No more asking for my girlfriend to turn down the tv. I can watch my sports and she can watch her movies and both enjoy our shows the way it should be. A must have when tvs are to close to one another.
R3F4UNM3UNM6DT,5,"We got this for me because I'm experiencing some hearing loss and television was always the challenge.  The family got tired of me asking &#34;what did they say&#34;.  They work great by the way, rarely ask that question any more!<br /><br />What I didn't anticipate is that they've become a family favorite.  Mom uses them when she's up later than everyone watching horror movies to avoid keeping anyone awake and our son uses them to watch his Minecraft YouTube videos that no one else wants to hear.<br /><br />Very happy with our purchase!"
R8B5MM5M90O62,5,"Headphones work great through ATT TV shows.  I have issue with Samsung TV apps and their Blue-ray apps, like Netflix, can not get the headphones to work even when I can connect.  Don't think it's the headphone problem.  Had a Sony headphones and batteries died cost to replace them $24.00 for a set.  The RS 120 uses AAA recharge batteries.  4 pack $9.00."
R2VJHXF7CBQ91T,5,"Great sound, comfortable and allow me to listen to TV at my own comfort level."
R3NZXTZO4YMSWF,5,I am very happy with my purchase.  The sound it's great and no static at all. Plus I could finally watch TV in my bedroom without keeping my husband up. I will recommend this product to a friend.
R3SR11JOFNKKFO,4,"I bought these to replace the same NON-RECHARGABLE type. The non-rechargable version goes through the (too-small) AAA alkalines way too fast. The price difference between non- and rechargeable is only $10. In the 4 years or so that I've had the non-rechargeable version, I've gone through at least that much in batteries.<br /><br />BTW, I originally got the earphones because my hearing above 4000 Hz drops off rapidly. My first earphones were Sony. I returned them after a week because they lost the signal at various places around the house and when they reconnected, they often issued at loud 'pop' -- as loud as a small gun going off in the room! The Sennheisers remain connected everywhere within a 2-story house with basement, AND essentially everywhere OUTSIDE on our nearly 1/2 acre lot. If they lose the signal when I get too far away, no pop, just in and out weak sound. The sound, BTW, is terrific; deep base and high highs.<br /><br />So why didn't I give them 5 stars? These are &#34;on-the-ear&#34; headphones. For those unfamiliar with headphone descriptions, &#34;on-the-ear&#34; means the ear pieces rest ON the ear, not on the head around the ear. The advantage of on-the-ear headphones is that you can also hear someone trying to speak to you. AROUND-the-ear headphones completely isolate you from room sounds. But their main advantage is that you can bend over and lower your head and they will stay on. If you do that with the Sennheisers, they slip off. Don't like that. . . but I am smitten with the quality of their sound, their range, and their price."
R1FUXP2O89TSTW,5,"Once you try them, you';; never be with out a pair."
R2XHTC77LBXGL3,5,"This item has been performing flawlessly, and it is comfortable."
R22303J03HBUAP,1,iT WAS EVERYTHING i HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE  WOULD RECOMENED IT TO MY FRIENDS
R3MD86ABV4TZQR,5,They are awesome
R1Q7NOFWKYA2AV,1,"Though comfortable fit, it did not work. No channels, at all."
R3U8YNXCPMIAFV,1,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband. They were great while they worked. As of last week they began to only work part of the time and a few days ago they stopped working all together.
R1NIUJUQ46BJ79,4,"POSITIVE:<br />- Very, very comfortable. I work on my computer with these things on all day, and they are the most comfortable headsets I have ever owned. More comfortable than over-the-ear. But I suspect part of this is personal preference.<br />- Great sound. I am no audiophile, but I am hearing parts of the music that I had not heard on my previous headset.<br />- Easy tuning and charging. No problems with interference. Charging is super easy<br />NEGATIVE:<br />Only 1 negative, but it is a biggie: the &#34;auto-off&#34; feature.<br />Basically, when the base station stops receiving noise from whatever it is plugged into, it turns itself off after 5 minutes or so. So that sounds neat, except: THE HEADPHONES DON'T TURN OFF!!!! So suddenly you get a burst of loud white noise over your headset. If you are watching TV with these, then this may not be an issue, as you will probably take your headphones off when you turn off the TV. But using a computer, I may turn off the music for a few minutes, and then after a couple minutes I am suddenly jolted out of my seat with the loud static.<br />Why would they automatically turn off the base station? It is plugged into the wall anyways, so how does it help? I wish one could disable this auto-off feature. It is a terrible terrible design decision."
R3E6FWJN1QJL1N,5,"The sound quality is much better than I expected. Plus, ear pads wear out and the ear pads on this headset are easy to replace. They are also comfortable and the headset holds them firmly in place. You can also replace the rechargeable batteries. This is particularly nice because I have several rechargeable batteries and a charger and if I were to completely discharge the batteries that come with it, I can quickly replace them. This is my fourth wireless headset for computer and TV and the best set so far."
R1E2WKSI25M5GM,3,"I got these for the morning when my wife is still asleep and they work pretty good. There is a little bit of a hiss or static, but mine is set up in another room which has to pass through one wall from where i watch tv. Use the fine tune knob and you can get pretty good reception. They were cheap. I hear all the rage now is bluetooth headphones. Those will be my next pair."
R1XWXU8QRF4BZ8,1,"I tried two of these from Amazon and the power connection is a problem, and appears to be bad product design. Could not get either unit to work, so, am researching other brands now."
R3HELQCRIHABUR,5,was a great buy and purchase.  I got it in hand within 2 days. BEAUTIFUL SOUND !!
R18UBN06RTVH1G,1,"this the second pair of these headphones I have ordered.  The first one lasted about 9 months and then just quit working.  I tried everything to get them to work, new batteries, everything.  Would not work.  A month or so back I ordered a second pair just in case.  So when the first pair stopped working, I had a back up.  Wrong, the new ones, right out of the box, would not work.  Therefore, I recommend you stay away from this piece of crap.  Oh, by the way, over 30 days and you are stuck with this crap."
R1IZHI3M5YADV2,2,"the headphones are not comfortable, we ordered 2 of these ,kept one but the one had a roaring in it, one side never did work,for what they cost it should be better!!!!!"
R30T7PLXCNW8HE,5,"Unquestionably Five Stars!  Update 12/14/16: I bought a new TV for our kitchen and purchased another of these RS 120's. The first 2 are still going strong and sound as good as they did from the start. Still 5 Stars! The newest TV had only an optical output for external Audio, so I purchased an  Optical Digital to Analog converter, musou digital optical coax to analog rca audio converter adapter and  set my TV's SPDIF selection to &#34;PCM&#34;, and all works GREAT. I worote a review on the converter as well, if you are interested and need one too. =============================================================================== My wife and I are 70-ish; When we watch TV, it is often difficult to hear what people are saying because of background music and other loud distractions. I bought a pair of these for us, and we are astounded with the great sound they produce. Now we can hear everything that is said on the TV program, AND the background sounds are still there, but somehow also sound great and are actually IN the background. I have both charging bases plugged into power, but just one is connected to the TV's sound output. I use the headphone jack on the TV, as we prefer that the TV's speaker is not on when we listen with these headphones. I cannot say enough good about these headphones. The distance these units can operate over is also amazing. I'm not sure what they are rated at for distance, but there is no where in my house that I cannot listen at, and the TV and base units are at one end of the house. I know that sounds crazy, but sometimes you need a break from watching, yet can still listen to the program for a few minutes. One of the best purchases I have made, ever. My wife has a set of TV ears in another room, and we believe they are a toy compared to the RS120 Sennheiser units, yet the TV ears cost more."
R27NLUUWWYZ318,5,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband and I guess myself. We like to get on the treadmill and watch TV and could never hear it unless we turned it all the way up which woke up our kids. They work great and we have walked throughout our house and still could hear the TV.
R3BE84FWOVNUY8,5,Use these on my treadmill.  Work well. I even run with them on my treadmill
R3D84PKJ7CGPJA,2,Unable to make the wireless feature work with the tv.  Need to plug into back of tv to use then unplug.  Should of sent it back.
R3KD2DKKKO3WKH,4,All is well
R1WU8IDCSY1GY4,5,very good price fast delivery works great
R1D261I2VYR3MF,5,Works great!
R2GMAXYAULB6C3,5,"I got this to replace an IR pair.  When selecting headphones this is VERY important.  IR is the kind you have to be right in front of it to get the signal, so things can get in the way like a book or a cat.  RF is the where line of sight doesn't matter.  Infrared vs radio frequency.  I also had to get this because my Xbox Kinect uses IR, and so my old IR pair was not usable (horrible noise).<br /><br />I'm very happy with this pair and have had no problems using it."
RD9VA055Z1SLO,1,I'd give zero stars if that was an option.  They don't work at all and unfortunately my husband waited too long after Christmas to try them and we missed the return date by four days.  Our fault but these are useless.
R2PPIE2510HHI3,4,"The headset itself is a little too wide from side to side.  Could have been made a little more narrow for a tighter fit across the head.  Other then that, the sound is great from close range and distance!  So far, no problems!"
R3JDH37EFAKCV,4,"Nice headset, I recommend it"
R2GY6RH3IL0UQQ,2,"Got them in November and at first they worked great.  The headphones tend to slide off backward if you move around much; best to just sit on the couch and listen.  In December we moved, got a different TV provider, and now they won't receive a signal.  I returned them for a new set thinking perhaps they weren't working but the new set acts just the same.  Am having a service tech come to try and connect them and if that doesn't work they are going back.  A lot of hassle."
R1PUP81VQVVHRH,4,They work very well and I don't have to always replace batteries as I did with others.  I like that I can listen to my TV programs and still walk around the house and get work done instead of sitting down.
R2HW126F5R60R4,2,"I COULDN'T GET THEM TO FILTER OUT THE NOISE FROM MY ROUTER, AND WHEN I BENT OVER TO TYPE OR WRITE THEY WOULD FALL OFF MY HEAD.  I FINALLY FOUND A PAIR OF HEADPHONES WITH CUPPED EAR PADS THAT STAY ON WHILE I WORK AND MOVE AROUND AND THEY USE 900MHz AND TOLERATE THE ROUTER NOISE BETTER."
R163IWIJV3VIYN,5,Absolutely works to perfection and makes hearing movies much clearer.
R2W9LFP0MBT6CN,1,after 3-5 minutes it goes to static
RYVKFM34KSRQT,2,"I'm not really sure how i will like these or even if I will keep them.  The adaptor plug in the charging unit was VERY difficult to see, and even MORE DIFFICULT to access.  How utterly ludicrous that they would put this socket in such an inaccessible place -- do they think ever user is going to have the tiny, nimble fingers of a 6 year old??  I don't care how good or bad these headphones work, if it wasn't so much trouble to repack them, I'd have already had them ready to return.  As it is, I've spent an hour trying to set them up and I'd rather not waste any more time on it, so will try them out and hope I never need to unplug the AC from the charger.  If I do, they will most assuredly go back into the box and be returned to Amazon.."
R1JGAKTQVYK386,5,use them all they  time
RYA801QUNKQJ5,5,Very good quality sound
R28TLDA5E2O5QH,5,I gave this a one star rating and now I am trying to send it back
R15DR3NSM1R9AU,4,"Easy to set up, batteries pre-charged are a nice touch.  Sound quality is &#34;ok&#34; but it's for my elderly Dad who is hearing impaired so he doesn't mind.<br />One BIG negative - the power plug for the base station was VERY difficult to plug in all the way.  Poor design of the housing / base station."
R2BQVPGPDLVMO8,5,"I've owned these for 6 years.  I was so happy with the first pair I bought, that I bought a second one for my wife!<br /><br />PROs:<br />-Great sound!  (Really this is the most important thing!)<br />-Multiple channels, can be used simultaneously so people in the house can listen to different things<br />-Awesome for watching/listening to not bother others, but ALSO for when doing household chores (can walk around the house doing stuff)<br />-Analog for superior speed (the digital ones have a significant lag for lip sync problems)<br /><br />CONs:<br />-Can get a bit uncomfortable after about 2 hours from the weight, enough for 1 movie but probably not 2.<br />-After a few months the volume knob gets crackley.  After a spray of electronic cleaner, it's back to normal.<br /><br />5 star.  Already bought 2...may need more!"
R3EI36QYZHWRA6,4,Good for listening and able to walk around in the house and going outside without wires to hold you back.Some hiss but can be adjusted
RPL8N2U25NKA7,5,Works great. I can walk out of the TV room with the headphones on and still hear very clearly. Comfortable and built strong.
R3KMBQBN85SKYY,3,I cant get the voices or anything from the television Do I need a special hook up?
R1Y5O871HGQZIT,5,"Great headset! Now I can watch tv at night and not keep everyone up! The range is great, I can be at the other end of the house and still hear perfect! The recharge batteries are a +"
R4DYVW2JFUKL0,3,Awsm but the akg of harman kardon is far better:)
R3EA5QM9YD3D6S,5,"purchased these for my mother who is hard of hearing, now she can listen to TV as loud as she needs too."
RAMSV3L9SA386,5,Great sound quality<br />Allows for private tv viewing
RAIXC3GBAEMVH,4,Great sound. Easy access to controls. Ear cushions could use some redesign.
R1EI1MSMFJTQP,5,Got it for my Mom who is hard of hearing. It works great. She loves it!
R1F4C3ZQXHDGFG,5,"great, thank you"
R32M0FJG2S7GV7,5,"Although they are rather big and unwieldy, they are wonderful for keeping they noise level down and not disturbing others in the house."
R114VP3FTGW33P,5,"I purchased a Sennheiser over a year ago and just recently purchased one for my brother-in-law. He absolutely loves it and his wife does too since he's not blasting her out of the house.<br /><br />Great buy, even greater results."
R1VAK91944ZXL3,5,Great
R33QM5L1V6A7DQ,5,"Works well. No problem setting up. Gives me something to listen to while cleaning the house, working outside in the garden, or when my husband is sleeping and I am still awake. Comfortable. Only downside is when I tip my head forward, they slip off, so I have to be mindful of that."
R3H5BCKE766FJZ,1,Useless
R3TETX0TRV27YW,5,My wife loves them
R2P2OTKC2QQHKV,5,"I really like being able to listen to my tv shows at a sound level comfortable for me without disturbing others in the room.  When my roommate goes to bed, I mute the TV and use my headphones so as not to disturb her."
R2XMOTIT22W223,5,"After constant use for several years my first RF headset phones finally gave out. I immediately returned to Amazon to order a replacement,"
R2NYJNNDWLBSY6,5,For my father in law who is hard of hearing. This was a great gift for him and us.
R3PX2RLJOF77F5,5,"Works great, excellent sound."
R18E7YHAGGSAV6,5,"These are great! Excellent sound, but I can still hear what's going on around me in the room.  My husband can watch TV while I sleep, too."
R11S8WKJ96V8X0,4,"Works well although I often have to keep adjusting the tuning, even when I just move my head; a problem that arose recently and was meliorated, but  not eliminated, by redoing the connections to the TV. But much better than the TV speakers."
R2DX7V6B0NY0EN,5,Excellent product
R214F5NHW2NTHT,5,"Exactly what I wanted for home so I can hear and my sweetheart doesn't get blasted.  I got a set of these years ago for my dad and his had a surround/stereo switch that this one doesn't, however, I believe they are now half the price that they were then and I don't have any quality issues at all.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat."
R9B1EATMBEVJ3,5,"We have had this set for a few years now and they are wonderful.  We do not leave them on the charger and the battery lasts a long time.  We use them generally to watch TV when our kids are in bed and we want to watch/listen to something louder or while we work around the house.  Great range, battery, etc.  Highly Recommend.  We have even though of getting another pair.."
R3UZ8NKWI8W4BO,4,"First time to try wireless headphones for a TV.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  First headphones didn't work so returned them (easier than I thought that it'd be).  2nd set works the way I'd expect.  Had to try lots of jacks on the back of the TV to find the one that worked.  Static at times is distracting, but an adjustment on the headphones takes care of it.  Now I've totally tuned out the family while watching TV.  Not sure if that's a good thing or not."
R18O61KQ6EBDWR,5,"Purchased as a gift, but I also own a set.  have owned it for a few years and still using the original batteries and lasts for hours on a single charge."
R20T3I5UARK0Z9,5,"Amazing sound, no wires, very well made!"
R1A1O8K9HW2A1E,5,"These really work. I bought for Mom in nursing home with a room mate watching another tv. Sadly she did not want to bother with 'confusing' head phones...she is 90. I wish she did, they are so simple. They worked right out of the box and following directions I would say they should work for anyone (which we all know is not as easy as it sounds, like you plug it in the wrong jack on the tv or your tv requires a menu pick to send the signal to the rca jack, not the speakers... then we blame the unit for the failure). These worked from 200 feet and multiple cinder block walls as I walked Mom to the cafe down the hall and it worked with almost perfect clarity. So instead of mom another family member uses them now for cleaning the house and listening to tv talk shows. Get them if needed and expect good sound the lower priced units I tried for mom did not deliver till I purchased these."
R1VJG9P3JYDSRO,4,"The best feature, IMO, is being able to use several off the same base signal.  This allows me to put the little kids to bed and still watch a movie with someone else without worrying about waking them.<br /><br />Great distance: can listen to music all over the house or even outside.  Good sound quality.  Very comfortable."
R33SVOV701OTXH,4,"Bought them for hubby who's worked in a factory over thirty years and doesn't hear so well anymore.  I couldn't stand to hear the tv at volume forty for one more day.  And that's volume forty on a 65' tv, which we had to buy because he won't get glasses.<br /><br />He loves them and says he can now hear everything on every show.  This is good since I felt so bad he couldn't hear what he wanted and it sort of embarrassed him that I had repeat things.<br /><br />Only problem is when he turns them up I can hear the sound coming out of them and that defeats the purpose a bit.  However, it's only a slight sound and not one that will make me need an ativan by midmorning.<br /><br />I can watch the same show with him and he can have the headphones on as loud as he likes and I can have the volume where I want and everyone is happy.<br /><br />He sleeps with them on all night as he can't sleep without hearing the tv and they stay charged a long time.<br /><br />I'd buy them again."
R3267G0SO4JG8J,4,It took a while in connecting them to get them to work.  These were a replacement and I set about  connecting them as I did my others but couldnt get them to work. Went to website and watched video.  Simple once we realized that because we now have Dish and not a cable connection set up was totally different.  Felt a little silly about it all but once connected they're wonderful.  Sound quality is awesome and my TV is mounted to my fireplace which the manufacturer states can cause some reception problems.<br />The only &#34;con&#34; which makes me give it only four stars is the headset.  They're made for someone with a BIG head and any adjustments you csn make to them is to mske them for an even larget head.  Im working on figuring a better way to keep them on my head.
R2IRRSRI4UUOKT,5,"Second pair I have bought, this set was for my dad.  We love ours for late night tv watching when the other person is sleeping.  Dad uses it so he does not annoy the neighbors or blow the speakers as he is a little hard of hearing.  One charge lasts forever and they are comfortable to wear, even with glasses on.  Sound quality is great, although I am no audiophile.  I have listed to TV and music and am extremely happy with the quality of both.  Highly recommended."
RIT7XQBRRLP90,5,great
R1VT2UUDGHT385,3,"They perform well, the only problem is that at times there is quite a bit of static. Other wise I would rate them higher."
R11BHHYWZ7GP1,5,So very happy with this product. My hubby has hearing loss from being in the Army and for years it's been a struggle to watch tv. The voice he has to have leaves my ears ringing and hurting after one or two movies. With these headphones we can each have our own volume.<br />I even bought an extra set to have on hand if these break. No down time for him. A++
R1GYEHYE8LG9O3,5,Wonderful invention!  Saves hubby's grumbling while I'm trying to hear TV.  They really work well even when walking into another room!!<br />So very glad I decided to try it!!
R1RGF1TDXY9I0Q,4,"So far, so good.  I bought these for my Mom so she could hear the TV without deafening everyone else in the room.  It replaced a broken similar Rocketfish set of earphones.  The documentation for these headphones was awful.  I called customer service for help and they were great.  The earphones come with a red and black cable to plug in.  Problem 1:  although the documentatiion doesnt say so, the black plug goes into the white  hole.  Problem 2:  the documentation said to plug them into the TV, the tech said to plug them into the cable box.  With that done, the device works fine.  It is much easier to recharge these headphones than the rocketfish ones.  You just hang them on the charger.  You don't have to jiggle them around.  Also the rocketfish had slide type switchs that were difficult to operate for my Mom.  They had very little feedback and were kind of hard to push.  On these headphones, the on/off swith is very firm and obvious.  The one problem with these headphones (the Sennheiser) is that the tuning switch is a  thumb wheel that is placed so that it can be easily moved when you grasp the headphones to put them on so you need to retune all the time which is hard for my Mom. I can't say anything about reliability yet as we have only had these for a week."
R13YIMJHDGT773,2,Looks okay and setup is easy.<br />But Sound quality is very low.
R25J30P14ZU5R3,1,"First, let me say, it didn't work.  Let me add, it is hard to imagine a more cheaply made, poorly designed product, especially from sennheiser."
R1HONRVPXDGUW9,5,"These headphones are perfect!Very comfortable and not only can I hear the TV now, I can understand what's being said as well. I love them."
RJ663WN6PE4WH,5,My deaf mom loves them
R2OR0P7XKPTY2H,5,They work great.  My husband is very satisfied with them.
R32PMRLX610NUK,4,I love them light weight
R1NH7HB53KX4FI,5,"These really are great headphones, and the quality of sound compare to price is outstanding. I really enjoy using these to walk around the house listening to the Pandora Radio playing on my laptop in my bedroom. Sure makes doing the dishes a little less unpleasant."
R195PDACUEAEJ3,5,Amazing sound!
R3BPAALC6QMAQ9,5,"These replaced my first bargain price wireless headphones, used mostly for watching TV that my wife wasn't interested to hear. I'm no audiophile, but these new ones produce clear and full sounding speech and music. No static. No hum.  No interference from anything in my house, even the vacuum or blender or any other appliance. Nothing fades or drops when I go to the refrigerator either. When there is silence on the tv, there is complete silence. BTW, they are so comfortable, you could forget they are there. The charging stand is sturdy and nicely finished too. Excellent."
R3MANLQY58DOA6,4,They could fit the ears better but they work great and the sound quality is good.
RJWK6ABYD10F2,4,very nice
R28GGKMF5PIPNY,5,"The bag is a nice bag, however the base of the bag needs better support as the base of our tree has already went through the bag leaving a hole in the bottom of the bag. &#34;Not good&#34;  I in good faith can not recomend this bag until they reinforce the base of the bag."
R1WD2XR2MOJO13,5,"We own two  different models ,this is cheaper priced but not all the features  works ok close and long range. red lights that shows charging will stay on even though it is completely charged...my other model  as soon Headphone is charged the red light start blinking after been solid lighted . So do not worry about the solid light after been charged !  it will show solid all the time !  recommended as second unit !  Merchant also recommended !"
R1OQL8LL2O4EH2,5,These headphones are terrific.  The sound is very clear and it blocks out all outside noise.  My mother goes to bed very early and I just hook the cable into the TV from the charging dock and put on the headphones and I can hear the TV clearly and the sound from the TV doesn't bother my mother.
RSU3AT1MX86SI,1,"These were dead on arrival. The power supply produces power but the base will not come on when the power supply is attached. We tried to contact the manufacturer but were unable to get through, so we finally returned these."
R3N9EFLRH97O60,1,I never could get them to work
R3CWWP35H5WAY0,4,"These are much better than I expected. When I first put them on they seemed to be pre-tuned to the base and they sounded quite good. The volume, however, seemed pretty low, even at max. Three minutes went by before it dawned on me to fiddle with the tuning wheel.. bam.. super loud and even clearer sound. I proceeded to walk around the house. Great reception with the only exception being the master bath (furthest point from base unit). Even then it was just very minor hum  when I turned my head in a certain direction. I docked one star due to the base station being very light. It moves about and tips over easily when trying to place the headphones in the cradle. Some added weight or optional suction cups would have been helpful but I'll rig something up to help with that."
R17VXN8UHJJ55G,5,Excellent.They are wonderful.
R28SNWWSF7WPFP,5,"These headphones were a gift for my mother who lives with us. She has 70% hearing loss in one ear and feels self-conscious about asking us to turn up the TV. These wireless headphones are of good quality, and the &#34;stand&#34; doubles as a charger for the rechargeable batteries."
R1DCLV1CYYXC8N,5,Very good product more than I expected
R25L2THP2U3Z0L,2,"I have one major problem with these: when there is no audio for 3 minutes, the base station stops transmitting and the headphones switch to loud static. I tried using these with my computer, and that surprising blast of static after any brief interval of silence is just unacceptable. It breaks concentrations, and made me not want to use the headphones at all, so I've returned them. Why the headphones don't shut off at the same time is beyond me.<br /><br />The sound quality was generally pretty good, though I noticed radio interference occasionally, such as when holding my head in certain positions."
R1FOR0APOQDCT5,4,"Bought this for my father-in-law for Christmas after reviewing many of its kind. This was a wonderful gift and he loves them! He uses them every single day, as my mother-in-law keeps our baby and he uses them to watch tv because he can't hear well and she has to be able to hear the baby. I highly recommend these for those that want to watch tv and need to do so in a quiet setting. The only drawback is that they are a little uncomfortable after wearing for long periods of time...like an hour."
R3POFH3HZUAHX,5,"I bought this model years ago and while I loved the sound, I moaned and groaned constantly because they wouldn't stay on my head.  I needed another pair for my boom box and after much research, I decided I'd buy these again because the sound is incredible for the price.  Once set up, I'd simply try to figure out the falling off problem.  Well, they have been in constant use since I set them up and I'm a happy camper.  It seems they have been tightened up so that they fit better plus I'm just more cautious now.    When considering how long I owned the first pair and considering they fell off hundreds of times and one ear pad had to finally be taped back on, etc. these ear phones obviously held up really well. And I just couldn't part with the sound and to be fair I'm guessing most if not all other models would fall as well.  After all, they are not clamped on LOL and if they were imagine how that would feel after a while!  Plus, after all those years of use, I only had to replace the rechargeable batteries once!    I had also ordered a new pair for the TV which I connected today.  So the old pair finally bit the dust but what a long ride it was even considering all those tumbles.  They just kept on keeping on.  I doubt they can be beat for the sound one gets for this price point.  So, then, I've gone from moaning and groaning to coming to terms with the one little short coming (which has been improved) and relish all the good qualities of these headphones.  In fact, since I need volume adjustment, I may end up getting a third set of this model for the computer.  Since they are wireless and self-charging, they have to be left plugged into whatever object they are plugged into.  Hence, I'll ultimately have a pair connected to any sound producing electrical object in the house!    Highly recommend these for the sound quality.  I doubt one can get any better sound or quality at this price point."
R3S8BOW5PK1C76,4,Basically very good headphones but a little tricky to tune at times.
R1ZETFMV2ZZL3N,5,"The best thing I've bought in ages!  This was a late night impulse buy.  Got tired of hearing &#34;I can't hear, the kids are too noisy, etc&#34;.  Had some issues with hooking up because we have a BlueRay /streaming device & a cable box.  If hooked up directly to the TV the TV volume control also controls the headphones.  Not good if you're wanting to watch TV and not disturb anyone.  If hooked to the cable box you can't hear whatever you're streaming as the streaming device is hooked directly to the TV.<br />This has nothing to do with the headphones, it's something I need to sort out.  The headphones themselves are amazing.  I had no idea that the quality of the sound that comes from the TV is so incredible.  You have no idea how much sound is lost when it's bouncing off of walls, furniture, etc.  With the headphones it's like being in a movie theater.  You hear minute sounds that you would normally miss.<br />I loved these so much that I just bought my father a pair for his birthday."
R17J1WWGM1F3SI,5,These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used and have perfect reception.
R2APAKDFQAF4NE,5,A great addition to my viewing pleasure.  The sound quality is very good (in stereo) and the phones are light and comfortable to wear.  Would recommend for anyone who may be having hearing difficulty and needs a boost without disturbing the rest of the house.
R1ZJMEJSDWB8R0,5,"These were a requested Xmas gift.  I'm still hearing satisfaction raves.  Well, what else is there to say!"
R3OMRX3KQVJDCJ,2,"The headphones were not pleasent to wear, they are made of hard plastic. Wore them a couple of times and now they are just gathering dust."
R273GRN8HYCWWV,1,constant static
RPPCPTN8YBB1M,2,battery charger does not work well .
R11U8YGNFAH57P,5,These head phones are wonderful!  My husband can now hear it as loud as he needs it to be and I get to sleep!  ;)  works for me!  He is very happy with them!
R2HUIOOVVM065B,5,Best investment I've made in a long time. I can now listen to television instead of the lady upstairs.
RBJ77CD8FFX4G,5,This is everything that I hoped it would be and easy to install.
RNLNZFORUCSTW,1,"I brought this head set a little over a yr. ago. It worked fine at first, but then it just stopped working I notified Sennheiser tech department they were very nice and walked me step by step oh how to trouble shoot it. However this did not solve the problem so I was advised to send it back which I did .I received it back yesterday(Jan 27) 10 days later which I thought was fine. Plugged it in and all was well for 3hrs. Then it just stopped working I remember all the steps that I tried the first time just will not work . Not happy at all"
R3LVRT9R1AGGN7,5,"these headphones work ,great. I use them every night. great sounding! jim."
R3B13ZT1FZLSB8,5,worked great
R105TJECR9UVFH,5,These headphones are great. Good sound quality and light weight. Really perfect for watching games on tv or listening to music.
R3QWJUQ8191BI4,2,cuts out sometimes even if my head turns the wrong way then you get ear popping static. Too expensive for a pair of not so great headphones.
R20M4KETNWS75Q,5,"excellent sound, easy to use.  Just purchased a second set!!"
ROC42MYGHLKGB,4,The headphones were easy to hook up and they sound great. The two complaints I have are: 1. The instructions don't say whether to keep them on the charging dock or no while not in use. 2: You need to be very precise putting them on the charging dock to ensure it's charging.
RO34MAK170XFG,5,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
R3S2LS2TZGCE47,5,purchased for my mother who very hard of hearing. she has hearing aid for one ear and a hole in eardrum in other ear so has the TV turned up and closed caption on and still cant watch a movie. These headphones are FANTASTIC. She s hearing the movie and no closed caption. she is extremely happy with the headphones.  I think this is the BEST thing I have every purchased for her. I recommend to anyone who has hearing problems.
R3552U1Q1VQMM3,5,These are great.  Work wonderful .
R2RGCW3LEG2COU,5,Good product
R30XOIG7HBJKME,4,"This is my first set of wireless headphones.  I wanted to find something that I can use while doing gardening/yard work all around the house without having a cord connected to my phone getting in the way, and this works great.    The 300ft advertised range seems about right.  You will get a little more static the farther you get from the base, but it's not so bad as to ruin the experience... no more than you would expect with this kind of device, but the manufacturer's claim of \\""interference free\\"" through walls/etc is not how I would describe it.  I would describe it as minor interference that is perfectly acceptable.    Sound quality is really good when close to the base, better than my previous set of headphones, I can hear nuances in the music I didn't hear before.  Headset is fairly comfortable but doesn't feel completely \\""secure\\"" on my head, like if I shook my head hard it might fall off.    Ultimately happy with this set, especially for the price."
R29YG3PME19RXC,1,"This item should be rated -3. For the second time in a row I received a unit that had a faulty transmitter. I plugged the unit into several different outlets, all with the same result. NOTHING  I did purchase one of the same units several years ago and it has worked perfectly. That was the reason I decided to buy another of the same. WRONG choice. Do not waste your time and money on these items. The manufacturer has obviously changed something."
R1VMCC5WI5X4A5,4,The headphones work well. The only thing I didn't like was the headphones took a little playing with to tune in the tv.  Other than that they work perfectly.
RYE54CTAREYFJ,4,Works reasonably well for the price. Sound quality is excellent.
R3SPSO0QQHMHIX,5,"I love these headphones. Easy to install and use. I was using the TV Ears headphones, which were uncomfortable and didn't fit my ears well. These RS120s are a dream to use. Very comfortable the my ears. The batteries when charged last over 12 hrs.  I can walk around from room to room with no interruption to the sound. Very light and easy to charge. I love that you can replace the rechargeable AAA NiMH batteries off the shelf when needed."
RE9DQSTFEPNL,5,Works perfect as described. Well worth the money. Perfect sound reception. It works with a dish satellite box when plugged in to it too.
R3JA9W27SI7GRR,5,thanks
R2G2LMJ2KBFHQ3,5,they are great just what I wanted
R9FDXPGG3OEUJ,5,I actually ordered these as a second set for my husband so he can have one at each tv. These are actually better than the previous version because they are rechargeable. They have great sound to them and the range is very far. He can actually be out in the garden and be listening to his favorite shows at the same time.
RG3IL21YO1MLA,5,"They work very well. My uncle, who has a hearing deficit, is pleased with his Christmas present."
RFYY01R1YCDXP,5,"I bought this headset when it was the special for the day, and I love this item. Some reviewers complained about static, but the directions with the item, and also some reviewers tell you how to minimize or eliminate that problem."
R15GGHV78NTEXY,4,"Works. The sound is clear for me. The headphones would not be comfortable with prolonged use... they flatten your ears instead of going over them. And I have to be very careful when I take the headphones off the transmitter or put them back on it. I found that unless I hold the transmitter unit with one hand while moving the headphones I have a very high probability of knocking the transmitter off the shelf it is on. Using this on a 50&#34; Samsung. It would not work on my 32&#34; LG because the LG does not have analog audio output, only optical. Tried to use a converter, but the LG audio is not PCM and that was a requirement for the converter to work."
R10D6FQP8M1CL,3,"My biggest problem with the RS-120 wireless headphones was that the RCA analog input jacks are not compatible with the digital optical audio output on my TV. Sennheiser support told me that most recent TVs ( my Panasonic is 4 yrs old) no longer have the analog audio output jacks. To remedy this, I had to buy a digital to analog converter and cable for another $55. The converter, a Orei DA34 model was required, according to Sennheiser, to be able to convert all of the types of audio output that you can get from your TV, including streaming content, blueray, etc. The less expensive converters generally can't do that.<br /><br />The phones are ok in terms of sound quality, but I do experience various and random hiss and loud pops. The quality of the phones is not the greatest, but ok considering the price. The on/off switch, for example, is just a nib that is hard to move except with your fingernail. Volume and tone controls do not move smoothly. The over-the-head phones themselves do not fit very tightly for a normal adult head and cannot be adjusted. This causes the phones to slide off the head if you look down.<br /><br />Overall, if I had to buy them again, I would look for something else."
R1R080W6BKQHYR,4,"The volume was great it does the trick,it did what I wanted,but the tuning knob was to sensitive. It was difficult to get it set up,but all an all a good set for the money."
RTUGHHTL6ZLML,1,"Very comfortable and good sound when they worked, but very impossible to tune and keep tuned.  Random static and volume spikes made this headset useless.  I returned them and got the Sennheiser RS180 which I love (mostly).  They auto select the tuning which makes all the difference."
R1GDGZD0WZW2OE,4,"its works very fine, the best for the price rigth now or i ve used it."
R2N2W70A8HYMTG,5,"I had RCA 900mhz previously and was happy, but these are sooooo much better!  The sound quality is amazing, the reception crystal clear, and verrrry comfortable."
R2GLZRBCEFUK5R,5,This is the second one we have ordered...
R3AMD78ZTAZCDF,1,"I heard so many great reviews about these headphones I decided to give them a try.  Could not get them to work at all.  Spent 4 hours switching connection points (my Magnavox LCD TV has several options for audio output) and adjusting tuning on all 3 channels.  Tried the batteries that came with it as well as some fully charged AAAs of my own.  Nothing worked.  Had a heck of a time getting the power cord attached, then the green light wouldn't come on, then when it did come on it would randomly shut off.  Headphones seemed to be decent quality, but the sending unit seemed very cheaply constructed.  Fortunately, amazon seems to be processing the return without any hassle.  Very disappointed they did not work.  Decided to go with a traditional set of Phillips headphones with a 10' cable extension instead, and they seem to be working perfectly so far.  This product has great reviews, so I'm guessing I just got a defective set."
R97XV639JO597,3,Nice sound!
R242CBEUP98B4L,1,"It only works in the headphones plug, was expecting to connect in a different outlet in back of receiver, so I don't have wires hanging out in the front. Lots of distortion when turned up, and falls off my head when I lean forward."
R33KEH34UDAYB,5,excellent.
R20391KHG5Q17K,4,"These are a very good option for the budget conscious buyer, the sound is 8/10 and the feel when wearing is also an 8/10. The buttons on the side are a bit close together but once you have it on and set the buttons are a non issue.<br />Also very easy setup, just plug it in, charge the headphones, and you are ready to listen while not interrupting anyone else in the room."
RZAC0KHA0ZYA2,4,"Bought 2, for TV and for computer use.  He can listen to his awful music while I am left in peace, and I can watch TV and Netflix and TEDTalks while he sleeps and I am dealing with insomnia. Win-win! Easy to locate the correct frequency and has a good range. Gave it only 4 stars because the headphones are too big for my little size 6 head so it makes it tough to do housework anywhere in the house while listening to TEDTalks."
R3U0ZMLQU4FHU7,5,"I am a musician - These are by far, the best quality AND Comfort, you can get. Light weight, no headache, but good lasting batteries & quality. All around Excellent. Definitely recommend. Since I've owned them, I've heard many people also say the same. A little more pricey than a bunch out there, but there's no turning back after these."
RLRUL2TD2ZS23,5,Really nice. Great sound and easy to use. Love being able to watch TV without disturbing others.
R3LB7BVTOH9BE,5,"Bought this for my parents, mainly my dad. He wants to use it while walking on the treadmill. He also like to hear every bit of the sound that comes from the tv. The headphones work perfectly. It gives good quality sound and is loud enough to walk on a treadmill and still hear everything. We also like the fact that you can recharge it with the stand. No buying batteries constantly. It fits pretty comfortable. Probably after a long movie you might get tired of having it on your head but I used it for about 20 minutes and forgot I had them on."
R2KM0YWM0WQRKG,4,I think we are happy with this order.I can read when my spouse i watching TV
RCUHN9MBODDW1,5,great product
R1ITZ1DSD8LBWO,4,My dad loves these for tuning out all other sounds and he is able to listen as loudly as he wants.
R12WCVJEIVGJCB,5,These work great.  They have a good range and sound.  I recommend them
R30B2TG2I1XUHU,5,"Arrived as promised, Love, Love, Love these ear phones, sound is great, I can hear every word even in a noisy room while TV is turned down to 0 so others can have a conversation around me. Amazon does need to be more clear in the ad because I had to order extra digital to analog decoder which also did not say I would need a cable to connect with, luckily I figured that out when I ordered. My Samsung TV needed this while my other TV's did not."
R3VIA9T1ZQKYXT,5,Second pair.  They work great.  Even bought a pair for my dad.
R2SWGB5OXKZ5F2,5,Good value for your buck
RKX33Z5Z2E000,1,must of gotten one that didn't work
R25R37UJHHBNGN,5,"Easy to use, easy to charge and sounds great.  I can watch tv next to my wife and she doesn't hear a sound.  Also they are comfortable."
R31E7K3PA3JSFK,5,"Pros- Very comfortable, good sound quality even from another room, easy to put on charging dock.<br /><br />When I first got these, I was a little disappointed with the sound quality. Then I read the directions. Once you get them set up on the frequency that works the best for you, they are great. I love the fact that I can go into another room and still be able to clearly hear the dialog in whatever show I'm watching. I can even take the dog outside and still hear.<br /><br />The headphones are a little large for me, but that's only a problem if I bend my head down. They fit my husband perfectly. Since the last headphones we owned broke because they were too small for him, I can live with this. I wear them when I work out on the elliptical and have no problem with them slipping."
R1BUTH3AKCW9MW,1,Could not get these to work - when I wrote to customer service they said I had to buy a $60 &#34;converter&#34; to use them.  Don't really feel like throwing good money after bad though.
RG3C3O06QAZ3Y,1,"It does not work properly, even with the Kindle I could not connecte it.  The sound is terrible and can not be graduate.  It is the worst product I have bought in Amazon and I could not returned, it is a fraud.  Very dissapointed with Amazon"
R1QY6DPTD5LUK2,5,I like toys!
R21JM1UCRKFQFF,5,Have had a pair of these for years and they are great. It allows you to watch TV or listen to music and not disturb anyone. Great sound quality and craftmanship.
R1PYQ8BFOWMJT7,4,"Good headphones, they are all that they are advertised to be."
R1F0E1CLJM3EZT,5,"We bought it for our family member, who usually watched a TV on super high-volume. The problem been solved, and our family member is very happy with an amazing quality of the sounds and the range.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality<br />Range<br /><br />Cons:<br />None (wish a li-ion battery)"
R1I8OYZ7DSUU8L,3,"one side of speaker headphone doesn't work, otherwise seems to be ok. sound is very good in the speaker that works. contacted cust service, very helpful, shipping new replacement. hopefully will correct problem"
R1MTD75EFSMYC6,5,Very nice wireless headphones.  Bought these for my brother who lives in a small apartment with a roommate.  He loves them!
R1LUK9VPP403CN,5,"This product is the best!  The sound quality is great, and the setup was so easy.  I can watch my programs without bothering the rest of the family.  If I leave the room during commercials, I can tell when they are over and it's time to return.  And they are a great help in the situation where one person is hard of hearing, while the other viewers are able to watch @ normal volume level.  I definitely recommend!!!"
RI2VPCDB1SXRN,5,great
RE6V5BRXQFR3U,5,"Now my spouse can sleep when I watch TV late at night. Simply connect the RCA cables from the Sennheiser to your TV output. Even if you lower the volume on the TV to 0 (zero), you can still hear sound in the RS120. As mentioned earlier, the only potential negative is that you can easily rotate the tuning dial instead of volume. But once you are adjusted to the unit, it is not a big problem. The sound comes out crystal clear---lucky that I had 3 channels to select from, as the first 2 had a lot of static. The unit recharges the batteries without needing to be plugged in (I guess induction charging)...just set it top the base. Works great."
R3H55TFTVLY76Y,5,Bought this for my man and he LOVES them.  He's a bit hard of hearing so these he can turn up to the volume he prefers.  These made a great gift for him.
R16YQKRQGONTP4,1,"Arrived defective. Sadly for me - I realized this only AFTER return window had passed, due to things coming up preventing me from being more timely. I plug in the stand part of this device and it's dead. I've tried every outlet. No juice. DOA. Very unhappy. Paid a lot of $ for nothing."
R173XHAFE298CX,5,"My husband is hard of hearing in one ear and deaf in the other. Watching TV together used to be painful. These are the best headphones he's ever had - his fourth pair. Super sound quality - I wish I had a pair! We can be in the same room watching TV together and when I go to bed, he can continue to watch in the den without disturbing me way down the hall. Thank you Sennheiser for a superb product!"
RO2DXBGMPDT9U,2,"Unfortunately, I was never able to get this item to work with the Samsung HD tv I purchased this for.  Despite trying all three channels and making other modifications as suggested, the best I could receive for sound was static.  It is possible the problem was with the tv and not the headphones. Very disappointing though."
R1Y7MEUHHS57RI,5,Works great! Excellent sound. Don't need my hearing aids. Love the recharge feature.
R3S8DE47HY1VDF,1,"This product was just what I needed. My Samsung TV had a compatible output jack, headphones with readily available re-chargable batteries, the sound quality from Sennheiser that I have come to appreciate.  And the product did not disappoint me ... for the first five minutes. Easy set up. Wonderful sound quality. Great distance. But five minutes after I started listening, the headphones cut off. I thought maybe the power connector was not pushed in all the way. It was OK, but as soon as I touched the transmitter the power came back on and sound was restored. For five minutes. Then it cut off again. Reading the guide, apparently if the audio signal is not strong enough, the transmitter automatically turns off. There is no on/off button on the transmitter.  I checked my TV. There was no way to increase the strength of the audio signal. The signal was strong enough to provide great sound, but not enough to keep the auto-shut-off from activating every five minutes. Very poor engineering design in my opinion. As long as your device can control the audio output, or has strong audio output, I highly recommend. If not, stay away."
R347M978K4EI6A,4,"great sound, a little tight fitting."
R2NGJWB4TM3N4Q,5,"Used them for over 6 years, on my second pair."
R1ZEQRSEI7Z50Y,5,This product worked great. Very affordable an made a great gift
RTEXOHVC1Z2GS,4,My father love's them and the family loves them even more we now don't have to listen to the TV blaring
R26W86SD8I1KX6,5,works really well and has a distance over 50 feet! this product I would suggest to anyone who wants to not disturb there partners while watching TV late. Very easy to set up and use.
R188PMFS80AE1J,5,"Okay, I researched headphones for my brand new tv so I went back and forth all over Amazon reading and reading until I decided to give these headphones a shot.  First, let me say that I was on a budget and wanted something less than $100.  By all means, I am not an audiophile.  However, I am a true tech geek and appreciate all kinds of good electronic equipment.  I was torn between these headphones and a pair of Sony that also had some very nice reviews.  I chose these mainly because they have replaceable rechargeable batteries.  The Sony had a permanent battery that if you needed to replace it you would either have to chuck your headphones or send them to Sony for a battery replacement.  Sorry, not for me.<br /><br />Anyway, the install of these headphones was quite easy.  At first, I  turned on the switch of the headphones located on the left headphone.  I then had to adjust the channel to get some sound and remove static.  No problem with that.  I moved the slider button on the right headphone until the sound came out crystal clear.  Then I adjusted the volume which is also located on the right headphone and then began watching my flick.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the sound.  Honestly, I don't hear the buzz folks are talking about.  I don't have a large place so when I go to the bathroom or the kitchen I don't miss any sound.  If I do get a little static, I just adjust the channel button a bit and I am good to go.  I am so happy with these headphones!!  My husband can go to sleep at night and I can work on my computer and watch shows all night long without disturbing him.<br /><br />I bought these for $79 and now I see them for $69.  I thought $79 was a great price so if you can get them now, I suggest that you do.  These are really awesome for the price and they are Sennheisers!"
R38W123KUJG9D1,3,Is OK. A little inconfortable
R16UUP6OWQRS8G,5,"I use these to watch Netflix or DVD's while I exercise on the treadmill.  They are a great upgrade from the wired headphones I had before; I love not having to worry about the cord anymore.  I have to admit I was leery about the reception especially as I jogged, but once I got them adjusted they have worked perfectly without a hic-up.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Comfortable and light and I can wear them for my hour-long exercise session without a problem.<br /> - The charger/holder works great and is a convenient place to store them when not in use.<br /> - The sound is very good and true to life.  However, keep in mind that I am using them to watch movies while running, so I can't speak to what the discriminating music lover would say.<br /> - It took a few minutes to get the static control adjusted, but once in place I haven't had to touch it since.<br /> - Battery life is adequate; but I only use them for an hour every day.<br /> - Absolutely no interference.<br />Cons:<br /> - They seem big.  I am a six-foot male and always thought that I had an average sized head, but I have to adjust them down to almost the smallest fit.  I am not sure what a smaller person would do.  However, this could be due to the fact that I am active while wearing them, so I need them to fit tightly.<br /> - It would be nice to have some type of indication that they were turned on.  I often forget to turn them off before putting them on the charger.  This hasn't affected me to date, but again I don't use them for long periods of time.<br /><br />However, overall I am extremely satisfied with them.  They are a definite boon to my exercise sessions and I would highly recommend them for this use."
R14MGSB6V0TSYS,5,my husband love this gift and I love it too finally I can sleep at night!
R3B631TTN4UJJZ,5,The headphone were better than expected. The BZK were somewhat disappointing; I thought I was ordering Betadine cleansing towlettes.
R2ADQYMI38JPTR,5,These are great headphones.
R1YK64QHQQ0ZP8,5,WOW !!! I am more then happy with this product.  Easy set up and great sound. I can walk from room to room still great sound. I can put the TV on mute while others sleep and still have great sound. Wonderful product and at a reasonable price. I highly recommend them. My review is short and to the point. Thank you and God bless you.
R264MGEBCZ5KY5,5,"Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones<br />These are extremely nice headphones, I have three sets . I have had one set for over five years . My hearing is not as keen as my wife's ,so when we watch TV I use these . We have a very high end surround sound retailing over $7,000.00 , and these sound better to me and I can set the volume to please me ."
R3UW5NJMFYYI5T,5,"Whenever my grandmother would come to visit she would BLAST the volume on the television. Now with these headphones, I can finally get some sleep! She even says it's easier for her to understand dialogue with the headphones than with the regular television speakers. Also, the wireless charging dock it perfect since she is not very good with anything electronic; all you have to do to recharge the headphones is place them on the stand. The rechargeable batteries are standard AAA - not proprietary - so swapping them out when they get old is easy, and I can always have backup batteries ready."
R3T96FUOMYHEFR,4,Works great
R1GCGZZ0BWTWXV,5,"Headphones work this time. Instructions in the box didn't exactly get the job done, had to go on website to finally be able to use them.  Sound quality is good."
R2KTFD6EU79ZE7,5,My husband can finally hear TV  loves it  great buy
R1EE94XP20KGQB,3,"I purchased this product to replace an AR ( acoustic research ) headset I have had for many years that finally quit. I mostly use ear buds with iPod<br />but wanted the full headset for watching tv at night and not disturb anyone in the household. I will say this headset is very clear and I don't have the hiss many others speak of and the range is pretty good although walking around outside the house does require constant adjusting.<br />I personally do not like the on ear instead of the over ear model that I had but this is just my preference. My first impression was that the ear pieces are really cheesy, a little bit of foam padding which is sure to flatten out quickly. Although the sound and separation was pretty good there is little base no matter how I adjust the main source. Aside from the cons I would say they are ok for the price but I should have checked out some of the other headsets out there personally before purchasing these."
R1QBLEJQ0K3Y7S,5,"Got these headphones for my husband for Christmas, he really likes them."
R3CS9WY0GPDIZH,3,The reception and sound quality on these headphones is good and as expected. The down side is that they are somewhat bulky and uncomfortable after wearing them for extended periods.
R1AHJJHP79MZ91,5,"Easy to set up, comfortable, sounds great."
RHEYLCTKRGM8J,4,Work well on husband that needs to turn up TV so loud it blasts me out of the house. With these sometimes I don't know he is even watching.
R1T3D9ZJKPQF9V,4,good
RL0Y6SYL6ODUP,5,To much gunfire and rock n roll have left me nearly deaf. I have a pair of these in two entertainment areas. These are not meant to satisfy the audiophile but they do what I wanted (great clarity) very well. For the money there is no comparison.
R3N3IW8RD7B0MB,4,"There is an occasional drift (happens at least once over the duration of the movie), you would need to tune it back for the audio to be clear, elsewhere product performance is good."
RGW47UKP5L28A,5,Great headphones.  They feel high quality and fit comfortably. I recommend it.
R32CG363MZ6O4W,4,For someone who has a hearing problem it offered an ideal solution for my wife and I.  I can now hear the TV with out her complaining it is to loud.
R3AFHD4PK7HD3E,5,It works great very clear no interference
R13EWHI72R7Y7D,3,"The sound quality is decent, fit and comfort are fine, and the wireless is conveniant. I'd give them a better rating but for one flaw: an very annoying, and fairly loud, static sound issues from the headphones if they lack a wireless signal for a while. This is really annoying to me as I'll often listen to music at work, then get involved in something, so forget to put on new music after what I'm listening too ends.. then suddenly, I'm jarred out of my revery by a white noise louder than the music I was originally listening too.."
R2OPOOJPR67EZZ,5,"Quick delivery, good quality sound. all good."
R3AZVJREPOL1TC,1,We could never get these to work.  Watched the video on mfg's websife to no avail.  Sent them back.  I have given up on T.V. headphones.
RD5KINHZIA4T1,5,"One of the best investments I've ever made.  Makes watching television with family so much more enjoyable.  When you have a family member who is hard of hearing and requires the volume on the television to be so loud it hurts your ears, these headphones are a godsend."
R2NK7B0V2R3C9O,4,little static had to adjust on my head.  once the static was gone had a great sound
R3I3YX76HDTDUP,5,Purchased for my in-law and it has been very helpful for hearing TV without keeping volume so high.
R11Y785DPRZMCE,5,work very good
R1WXQ6Q39S47F4,5,awesome gift for Dad who could not hear TV  worked great
R3ASZD1FQ2RDSZ,3,"They're ok. Sound isn't all that great, but they're passable. Don't even think about going on a treadmill with them on. They fall off your head if you move too much, but ok if you're just sitting or walking normally. I wouldn't buy them again if I needed to, but they're not bad enough to return."
R1XCEB297KFTVD,5,"This is the second one I bought from Amazon. I had to return the first one - it made lots of strange noises, some of which were ear-splitting. But the second one works very well, and is very comfortable. Only complaint is the size of the base station, which takes up more space than I'd like. Had to relocate the base station as a result - it's now in the bottom of the DVD cabinet below the TV, so it's unobtrusive.  It occurred to me that might be the reason this pair doesn't have the strange noise problem - the base station is further away from the TV than before."
R2R2JEP57V2HSZ,5,"Excellent Head set! Very comfortable. I don't lose reception until I'm about 800 feet up the driveway, and the sound is superb. I recommend these to everybody who is looking for a good dependable head set."
R3D24MJXWUH3KL,5,Bought this for my father who is hard of hearing and I was tired of him having to have a wired headset which can be dangerous for older people.  This unit works great and he love its.  He is able to walk all over his house and still listen to the television we have it hooked up too.  I definitely recommend this to anyone needing a wireless headset.
RTDT5QPZIYCO7,5,"I got this for my boyfriend as a gift last X-mas and he LOVED it! Said it works wonderfully, the sound is amazing and it works anywhere in the house even if he closes the door. He's very happy about it."
R151DCZC50VE7U,5,Another Sennheiser HomeRun
R2UK46U5LW4N12,5,"GREAT . hard of hearing makes it better for Me and my Wife ,T V doesn't have to be so loud that it blasts her out of the room and I can hear fine no matter how low it's turned down. Can even watch tv after she goes to bed as I turn the volume off on the tv. wish I had found these years ago."
R2VRO7ES6UZEX0,5,I love quiet reading in the evening. My husband likes action packed TV. These earphones are the perfect solution! My husband loves them and so do I !
RLKXA7R51THZQ,3,"It is ok for watching TV news or TV series, but not for movie. It doesn't give good sound quality. Always hear his sound. When you put volume high, the hiss will blend. Not that heavy."
R2I20YNXC0SGST,1,"After two weeks of use, one of the earphones stopped working.  I contacted Sennheiser USA and recieved a suggestion to try to find out if it was the TV or headphones.  It is the headphone that is inoperable and they never responded to me again.  This is the cheapest wireless set they make, so I guess that I got what I paid for with no customer service support!"
R35FGHISZHIFYF,3,"Took a while to get working.  Actually had to read the manual which I almost never do with a product.  Make sure the volume is turned high going into the unit otherwise it won't transmit.  If you are a small person (even adult), the headset might flop around--not enough adjustment in the head band.  Also will fall off your head if you bend down.  Since the transmitted audio signal is analog, not digital, there is background noise (hiss) similar to old am radios.  Once I had the unit setup properly, it worked fine."
R2972GJK6SP99P,4,Operating range could be improved.  They also don't hug ears enough to keep from falling off your head.
RI0DKLTZMQ9J5,1,Wasn't what I thought it would be. Returned after it was gifted for Christmas
R19N8KY74UAP4I,5,excellent
R29COPROHBB360,5,"Purchased this after my Koss headphones s*** the bed after less than a month. These headphones are AMAZING! Perfect sound, no hissing in the background. Walked all around the house and could still hear perfectly. The headphones are a little too big for me and slide off but I can definitely look past that because they work that good."
R1TQUEE21SP29M,1,Returned as did not help my  husbands hearing the TV too much feedback noises bought a theater system works better for his hearing loss
R2CD38ZYZ96N31,5,"This is our second set, they last about four years with constant use.<br />If your home has problems with who watches tv and who reads.this is your answer.<br />D in Dixie"
R2KU90C09E0M6D,4,Fits my need<br />100% thank- you.
R2C9BU2ISKRXOK,5,"These things are great.  I got them because my Dad has trouble hearing the TV.  Now, when he's over, I plug them into my receiver and he can hear great.  One thing to be aware of is that some TV's will mute the main speakers whenever the headphone jack is used.  In this case, the only person able to hear the program will be the person wearing the headphones.  I have a surround system that allows me to plug into the receiver and still have sound coming out of the TV speakers."
R20PR8TZTIRO4,5,What took us so long to get these?  We use them for TV and the CD/DVD player.  The TV Ears kept breaking and the parts were way too expensive.  These are great and comfortable.  I love the RF because if I leave the room I can still hear what is going on.  And the charging cradle works slick without having to play around to get the charging light to come on like we did with the TV Ears.  We hardly use our surround sound anymore.
R1VAZK8DDLTRQH,1,"didn't work, so sending it back"
R34IJ36FJMR5PF,5,"Just Awesome. Range is excellent. I can hear without quality loss between floors in my house. No interference from other Wi-Fi device, both in 2.4 and 5GHZ, microwave or Central Air AC. Wireless is great."
R38OWHH5LOJDSX,1,"If you like your music and audio to sound like a walkie talkie, this set is for you! I should have done more research - these are RF...I'm assuming now &#34;Radio Frequency&#34;. Seriously ancient technology. The transmitter/stand is essentially a radio you plug into your PC and the earphones are receivers. And you have to tune to your station with a dial on the headset. And by that I mean, every twenty minutes or so you'll have to ever so gently roll the dial as you find your signal fading and/or picking up static...and in an unfortunate case like mine, where a few other people at the office have the same headphones, picking up their stations instead. Despite 3 channels & re-positioning the transmitter, there was an ever present radio hiss/buzz, especially noticeable in quite moments (like between songs). And woe is the person that stops playing music or a video for a minute; your punishment is a harsh loud constant blast of radio static as the set loses reception. I honestly don't understand all of the positive reviews here. That said, these were absolutely the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn! And I say &#34;were&#34; because I happily sent them back for a refund."
R3VYJI7293BLW0,4,just got it but have not had achance to use it looks ok willsee.
RNMRRH10CDXOF,5,I love these!! i can wash dishes ..do other hobbies in another room and enjoy whatever i listening to or watching. iT ESPECIALLY WORKS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL ARE ALSLEEP!
RW7EXTMR3RIGQ,5,"Comfortable head set, sound is stereo.  You don't have to be facing the tv to hear it and you can mute the tv and still hear the sound in the  headphones.  My man loves them, so do I."
R20TNFELDSLQKR,5,Saved us from yelling to turn down/turn up the TV!
R37DB1USTFMIHI,4,Just what I expected
R3A2AFD284GU42,2,"The sound quality of the headphones themselves is decent, but there's quite a bit of noise even after very carefully tuning the radio. It would be nice if they used a digital signal, it would make a world of difference for the audio. Overall though, they're pretty good. Sennheiser usually does an amazing job with headphones while keeping the prices reasonable, but these don't quite cut it."
RCA6V6USRU9WB,5,My wife's Christmas present and she had enjoyed it immensely.  Works very well and easy to set up.
R1PLCSKRXM5HM2,5,Works very well. Very pleased with the performance.
R18WUZYDTLXWGK,5,"These headphones are wonderful, since my husband is hard of hearing, and....I'm not!"
R2DKPP7IU6M4UT,1,Not really happy with these headphones. The audio quality is not great and I'm constantly losing connection with the base station.  Pass on this item.
R2T0LG4G0M07TW,5,Great
R5CGX3KYPN9KS,5,"This headset is just what I needed to understand what was being said on TV,,, a 3 D of sound , fantastic......"
R28W7EMWPK08QY,5,"These things are awesome for the price. What more can I say. Bang for the buck. There is never any interference, unlike my POS turtle beach PC headphones. These are great for letting someone else sleep while you use the TV. Would buy again."
R3C0MVMFOC54V7,5,My husband is a little hard of hearing. He can wear these headphones and crank them as loud as he wants without blasting me away with the television. We both love them.
R3FH7X0H4GJ8MK,5,What a great headphone!!!<br />The good think about it you can use it internationally .<br />Charger works with all voltage and even you can use it with buying 2 AAAbatteries invade you don't want to carry charger unit with yourself.<br />I am happy to have it
R2TKHR3E4JGL6T,3,"Purchased for my elderly mother---who has hearing loss.  I thought this would help, and it did.  However, on her small head, the thing (headset) is massive---both is size and weight.  I don't know the comfort, but suspect it could be uncomfortable over hours to having on your head.  Unit --- buttons on headset are small and not designed for elderly.  You can't see the switches nor can you feel them (too small).  Recharge device is large too.  I think a redesign could make this entire package smaller, lighter weight and easier to use for older customers."
R2HC9JIIL69RSH,5,Good product for the price
RXYV9MC1W4OHA,5,"Wonderful, you can walk anywhere in the house or just outside with great sound."
R2ALOOIHWI0H85,5,"Got these for my husband, who stays up way later than I do.  Totally solved the issue of multiple &#34;could you turn that down, please&#34; requests each evening.  He says the sound quality is amazing.  Great buy."
R1YO19973BNK1R,5,As good as advertised. Shuts out extraneous noise and even works when TV is &#34;muted&#34;.
R26UM2RXXCX1QV,5,very good
R3LOU4ZY2N63QP,4,"There are 3 things to know before you rush to return this item if it seems to not work while setting up with a tv...<br />1. Don't worry about the green light going off/on sporadically.<br />2. Use the red/black 2 to 1 adapter (red cable to red prong, black cable to black prong, opposite side single prong into device).<br />3. Plug headphones with adapter into your laptop first, play a song, and get it tuned with the dial for a strong signal, then plug into the tv.<br /><br />My father in law tried for 2 days, on 2 different very new flat screen tvs, using all various configurations and all he got was static EVERY TIME.  He boxed it up and told me to send it back, it was defective.  I got online, read the reviews here on Amazon and discovered that either people had no problems whatsoever from the set up or major problems and returned it.  Some more reading, and I found various tricks to try.  The use of the adapter and tuning it with the computer worked for someone else, so I gave it a try (after my own unsuccessful tinkering with tvs only).  To my surprise, the laptop trick worked like a charm.  I immediately plugged into the tv, and lo and behold, a perfect set up with sound and everything, but I had to use the adapter.  Nada without it. Maybe the headphones are more compatible with computer technology, I don't know, but before you chuck your new headset against a wall, try the laptop trick."
RRLSBJ8I0M8NR,5,Great.  I can roam all over the house and outside some and still hear the show.  I can hear all the little details of a show that I used to miss.
R3M2MEC8QI5XYT,5,"Have used them daily for years without a hitch, would highly recommend."
R4GRXGVRMUHAH,5,Fully met my needs and expectations.  Sound is very good. I can pick up sounds not normally heard on regular speakers.
R17IPPQL6OVQTI,5,Best set of cordless headphones I have ever owned.  You will not be sorry for buying therm.  I have gone through serveral pair of headphones that just quit working just a short time after getting them out of the box.  I have been using this pair for awhiloe now and they are still working great.  Buy them you will not be sorry.
RM80FKWOWA12C,4,"Got it just after Christmas and so far we like it and it works great, just wish the head phones were not so big."
R1R43YNFZ8F7IY,4,Perfect in every way but needs to be recharged quite often.
RIDKOYH8FW2NZ,5,Great item
R2YP7PWT0P76VX,5,I love the quality of these headphones so much that I purchased this product a 2nd time for my father-in-law that is hard of hearing and uses a hearing aide but not while he is using this product. The absolute BEST wireless headphones ever and they work as described by the manufacturer.
RWH8OGBTHPE92,5,Excellent sound
R36PX9RB236HFX,5,Bought these for my 80 year old mother she loves them wears them to hear tv everyday
R39APEQYKKML02,1,Base will not turn on when plugged in. Embarrassing because it was a Christmas present for my wife. I nred to send it back.
ROZ7NU381HYI7,5,Use them all the time!
RXAKK683F0KGU,5,"Ever walk into your parents house and been assaulted by a blasting TV? Here's to a little peace in the household! Super easy setup, easy charging, comfortable over ear design. Parents love it much better than the other &#34;as seen on TV&#34; company's version which easily failed and was expensive for low quality.<br /><br />I know these have many other uses, but for my parent's needs this is EXCELLENT."
R1MQPTSF0972NI,5,"my mother uses these everyday. She loves them. They are very clear, no static at all and they are very comfortable. She wears them for a couple of hours at a time and never complains about making her ears or head hurt. In fact she will walk around the house with them on while listening to TV. They have made our lives much better. I don't have to turn the TV up loud for her and deafen me. Haha"
R18M3U2J7H6WY,5,"Works great, little static but otherwise does it's job"
R1T4ZTKOD6Z4L9,5,"initially had a hard time with the connection to the base, but got it in and works great."
RREOZ6HYRMIE9,5,Bought as a gift for my wife. She needs the TV to fall asleep. I can't fall asleep with it playing. Now we turn the sound down on the TV and she hears with these headphones. We have achieved harmony.
R16WVK8M6OOT5H,3,"These are fine. The more the line level is turned up and the lower the volume is on the headphones, the less background hiss that you'll hear. These are basically used for late night TV and are not audiophile quality by any means- but they are decent. I love the charging, I needed to supply the rechargeable batteries."
R1UT6LDEFTA00K,3,"Everything works fine, but the sound is base heavy and often irritating"
R2M37JOZVMBUPR,5,Bought one for my husband and recently ordered one for my stepfather. If you have someone in your household that has the television blaring and it is driving you crazy.....this is the gift for them and it will save your sanity.
R10VMGQ75LOY0Z,5,"Got these for my partner, who has hearing loss in both ears. He absolutely loves hearing sounds in his favorite movies that he's never heard before. The only issue we've had so far is that the batteries that are included don't last long, which was to be expected."
R29F86E7DQ2N3I,1,I have bought 2 of these headphones for my husband.  The first set lasted not quite a year and wouldn't charge anymore so I went ahead and bought a second set last July.  Unfortunately my husband dropped them and the very tiny on/off button broke off.  So even though the set is not quite 6 months old they told me it would be $45.95 to repair them because damage from dropping the headset isn't covered.  I believe that if the button is so fragile then it should be better protected on the headset. I won't be buying this brand again because I would like to have something that lasts at least a year before it quits working!
R1P3ENHFP1U85A,5,"Wonderful clarity, incredible sound!"
R14YR4FP52M73Y,5,"It works as advertised.  It is easy to set-up and use.  Battery life makes it a worthwhile, usable item."
R1QV7KCUBG1035,5,"Absolutely love them. They actually aren't for me but bought them for my hubby as he was getting sick of me asking him to turn down the tv since I go to bed before him. He loves them, say they are light and comfortable and can still hear the tv when he goes into the kitchen or bathroom."
R2RTTYJD9RDAVW,5,"FINALLY, our marriage is saved!!! Bought these headphones for my husband's Christmas gift and he LOVES THEM!!! The headphones can be muted while I am sleeping peacefully beside him or we can watch TV together and he can use them to just hear the TV better. It's wonderful!! I purchased these because of their customer reviews but, in particular, because they had batteries which can be purchased to replace these, if needed. I returned the Sony headphones because when their batteries die, you have to buy new headphones. These headphones are worth the price!"
R1QEBY8NEUXE9T,5,"I'll tell you all a secret that I have kept from my family.<br /><br />There is a TV in the living room that only my children use. I used to have to yell at them to turn it down all the time. It was always blaring incredibly annoying cartoons and other awful things my kids for some reason enjoy watching.<br /><br />One weekend when everybody was gone, I removed the back panel of the living room TV, and unplugged the wires that go to the built in speakers.<br /><br />My children came back home, and of course the TV immediately got turned on. Silence. After a few minutes of them messing around with the volume, and mute, they came to the conclusion that the speakers were broken. I pretended to show concern, and gave a good show of trying to &#34;fix&#34; it all the while evilly laughing to myself.<br /><br />I told them I would fix the sound by ordering some headphones. Now my children can watch their horrible shows and turn it up as loud as they want while I sit back, smile, and enjoy the silence."
R37779ILH5B509,2,"We had trouble with a lot of static.  Unfortunately, support is only available Mon-Fri 8:30 - 5.  I work and not at home during that time.  I had to email my questions and then wait for a response.  Very frustrating.  My husband wants to return the unit."
R3R0BA4CWFELLN,3,One side of the headphone quit working withing 3 months.  Loved it until then.
R2CHP6Q6SYEMFC,5,These are the best headphones for TV listening. I wear hearing aides and don't always understand the words. with this devise on I can hear perfectly and clearly. I highly recommend them. They are very comfortable and I can walk away from the TV and still hear every word.
R28V57JX5IK8OC,5,Works great so as not to disturb others.
RS9CNG9B80LZL,1,"Returned 1st set due to no sound from left speaker. Second set did not work either, same problem. product is junk.  Thank you Amazon for taking care of returns and refund."
R2GHAOPSDTR0SS,5,very happy great product
RTCQUCSZ6QN6S,2,"Not a fan of these, uncomfortable. Will be returning"
R2J5H7CN4DP6V,5,They work exactly like they said they would and do just what I wanted them for. One small problem tho. I don't have much hair and they don't fit my head very tight so if I move quickly they slip off. As I am old I don't move around that fast so I can live with that.
R2VW0T4U327KQ2,4,good sound quality minimal background static that can be reduced through tuning.
RQNZ6ZPO8HEQE,2,My husband is having a problem with it making a  loud static noise after just a little while using it and it will just quit working after a bit.<br />The two lights on the front one green one red the green will cut off  after a bit  and the headphones quit working.  You might get 20 minutes out of it.
RCGXPH88ALR1M,5,"If you have a hearing problem and your TV partner has normal hearing, consider these headphones. They have been reliable, low maintenance and provide clear sound. My only problem with them is that they fit loosely and easily fall off my head. If you eat while watching, don't let your head droop over your plate!"
RG8MBYYOX4GQX,5,Great because I can walk TV without disturbing anyone else.
R1C5RWU1CGYVAV,4,Nice for the price...sound a little &#34;tinny&#34;.
R2BU3YZX4FVTVQ,5,got them for my mother who wears hearing aids--with headphones she hears very well and now enjoys the TV. Also easy to operate
R3F39FEZ9QDGDW,5,Works as advertised.  Sound is great and I no longer disturb others.  Recommend them to others.
R1G8Q95XGK9GF8,5,I really like this device. Very comfortable and seems to always work.
R3P6DTPRHKXAU5,5,"This headset met MOST of my expectations, this is my second set. I only wish there was a way to adjust the head band so they wouldn't fall off when I bend over. There's no way to adjust the tension in order for the headset to be tighter on the head"
R1SYLXD4W6KH22,5,Found to very reliable sound is good wireless works well. Quality workmanship very easy to hook up and use. I would recomend these to a friend.
R1YTEUE8D50DIB,5,I bought these for my dad who kept turning his TV volume higher and higher.  He loves this headset. Excellent sound  He likes that he can leave the room and still has the TV sound with him.  Worth the money. Easy hook up.
RTR23KR2IX2TX,1,"The good: The ear muffs are easily removed.  Headphones are lightweight.<br /><br />The bad: Poor range, loud static when not perfectly tuned. Loud static if no signal from rcvr.  Did not keep tune over two days.  Uncomfortable.  Cheap feel.  So light, they feel like they will break in hand."
R7X80RPO3QXCO,4,Decent sound for the non-audiophile. Adequate bass for those who have not substituted loudness for quality. My only quibble is with the fit. Either my head is shrinking or the headset fit is loose for the average skull. The actual ear-pads are comfortable for my usage (about 4 hours per day).
R15QEQ3PE5QMUG,4,"Works great. Get very good sound. Ball games give more announcer sound and less of the crowd uproar. I like that. Get a little bleed of some other station I think, but is not bad. Ordered a second unit for my father-in-law."
R2BCOQXSBBRX3R,5,"i had one before, like that time i am truly in love, my ears feel in heaven"
R1YNMCMJEUAYHN,3,No connection for direct line from I-phone to headphones must use wireless receiver.
R3ETPR22N4XIHT,5,"An Awesome product. I bought TV ears for my parents and they complained about the pain in their ear due to its weight and how the head set is being worn. I set the headphone for them, NOW, no complains!!! It really made a difference."
R3F3H8OQ1A6WZZ,5,Very nice!
R19OPR246GGXJ9,5,"My sister and I got these for our 89 year old mother for Christmas.  My brother had to set them up for her since she is technically challenged, but she absolutely LOVES them!  She lives in a retirement complex where she has neighbors on either side, and she is losing her hearing.  Now her neighbors are happy, and Mom can hear every word clearly now.  She said it was one of the best gifts ever!"
R8W1QSGC69ZJK,5,"Great sound, easy to recharge/store.  Easy to hook up."
R2E8C49JU0OFBJ,1,"This claimed to be the best of the headphones.  However, no matter how it is adjusted the smallest movement of the head causes unbearable static.  I would NEVER recommend this to anyone."
R1K8SY22Y219WX,5,the only Brand I will ever buy for my hubby! He loves the sound quality and the fit!
R11LNG6ESY71JL,1,"It's too big, won't stay on my head.  Doesn't work very well anyway,  lots of static.. Go's in and out , can't keep it tuned in right.  Sorry I bought it."
R2BT43R58MPHMC,4,Works good
R157XKC69A4NNQ,1,Quit working after the first week
ROO7CHEVEWJ6F,4,Perfect for my .  Just what she needed.  Fragile though.  Son dropped from 3feet to carpeted floor.  They stopped working.  For replacement headset later.
RT92QOUAW2RMG,5,just as described and does a great job
R5X7X7G8L7KSK,5,Thank you.
R3HPW6QHW3BC4H,4,Works great.  Great price.
R1NXYF8PIOSJC0,1,"Blew up two batteries, practically burst my eardrum once! Something is wrong with this product. Buyer beware!"
R29BLUG6LTYKWJ,4,"Not much grip to the ears, kept slipping off whenever i bend"
RRLEW4NN5GXQH,5,Grandson apparently loves them! These were top item on his wish list and I haven't heard him say anything except &#34;thank you!!!!&#34;
R1AG571Z9X4H5V,5,This purchase was a replacement for the pair we used so much we wore the letters off.  With the headphones my 87 year old mother can listen to the TV at the volume she needs while I can mute the TV and continue working on my computer without interruption.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants a fabulous stereo sound or needs the convenience of separate volume control.  5 stars all the way.
R5SLZTPZPRH67,5,Bought these for my husband fir Christmas.  He loves them. Can hear every word said and doesn't even have to ask me what they said. Very good price. Great product.
RG20SD8NK0K2L,4,it works fine
RVWPVGVG8BSKX,3,the headphones resting on the charging dock is not sufficient to make a green light to indicate it's charging; it needs added weight to it
R16M12XHXVGMA,5,"Love my Sennheiser headphones.  We use two other sets of headphones at our church with our sound system and they have worked flawlessly for several years.  This set was purchased to work with the IMac for sound editing, and the clarity and usage is wonderful.  So glad that we got it."
RJ54VBNOAGJZ4,5,"perfect so far. sound is superior. Now I am able to watch TV, listen to music, and read a book in the comfort of my easy chair."
R2ULTS3B4C42U5,2,"The Good: It has pretty good range. The sound is good.<br />The bad : 1) When the audio input is stopped for a few minutes, a sudden loud static burst through your ears. Even though you can switch it off using the button in headset, it is very inconvenient when you are browsing through Netflix or Internet content in TV. I can n't believe people who designed this did not think of it or test it before rolling it out to customers.My old Sony headset did a pretty good job of automatically turning off without bursting my ears , if there is no sound input.<br />2) The headset is not very firmly attach to  your head.<br />3) Minor background noise sometimes, but it can be controlled by adjusting the volume in TV<br />4) The volume and Tuning buttons are in the same side of the head, you tend to accidently tune out while trying to reduce or increase volume.<br />I returned the product after a couple of weeks use.For me, (1) was the deal breaker. Will not buy Sennhieser again."
R1W9IWTRXQSS93,4,Good product for the price. No static from 25 feet away. Just wished the ear cuff were softer.
R3B65ZHSMRS9W,5,work's great 360 degree sound.
R26Y0CMLU1KCVB,5,works fine on tv
R2A5SN8Q972NGK,4,"Works better than I expected, would be 5 stars if the headset wasn&#34;t so large.<br />However it is very comfortable nevertheless. The sound is much better than anything<br />I have tried previously plus it is very easy to use."
R3799MJ3XJIQGU,5,"I gave these to my husband for Christmas, he wears them whenever he watches the tv."
RAMSQ50IQXNSO,5,Bought this for someone in my family who is getting hard of hearing. Plugged it into the TV set and it was a revelation. I've never received so much gratitude for a gift. A sensational idea for an aging friend or relative. Really nice to find a tech gift that can be so important to someone's true enjoyment.
R2CSEKPIK8F6GC,4,"Great sound quality. I returned them because they hurt my ears after a while. I did not realize they were ON the ear instead of OVER the ear. After about 20-30 minutes, my ears and head would start to hurt like a headache. BUT, they have good sound quality."
R1HLJD64D823M9,4,great for the price.
R28BUREHMGNWPM,5,Seller great! Product was just what I needed! Volume is clear and sounds amazing!
R2UZXU7OP4061C,4,Very good.  This is the second one I have.
R1O6QJ09SHFL0J,5,A great value and good sound.  I was surprised with the bass of this unit considering it is wireless.  I was tickled with my gaming experience.  Sennheiser continues to put out good products.
RQK1NBD7SE486,5,Easy to install. Instructions right on. Sound terrific. Perfect for me watching TV while my wife reads or sleeps.
R134ZM0BQUTJGN,3,I bought this for a gift. Unfortunately the person I bought this for didn't like the item.
R3HH7G9ZE4H4BI,5,very good.  However there is a slight echo with the TV volume.
RJFDY2XY5FLT8,4,"Unlike SET840 from the same supplier, does not come with a microphone adaptable to any TV set (it should).  The tuning knob on the headphones is quirky and easily disturbed as user attempts to modify volume on the same headset ear.  We have found its sound quality entirely adequate, as is its amplification, but inferior to SET840 which we have also purchased."
R4YZHMUPVWLU3,5,very good reception
R1HVGWPZPZPURO,4,"It was a gift for my husband and he does like it, but he says it has an echoing sound.  But he likes it better than having the tv up to loud that doesn't help in hearing or understanding."
R1URNDTYDCO033,4,comes with all wires needed for hook up so do not buy anything else. Fits and sounds great
R1MKHZVMNL64AG,5,Terrific.  My husband and I both use one when background noise is louder than dialogue.
R1PYJ6JZRSCZIO,5,Great product!!! Exceeded my expectaions.
R1IXB5Y1UPHML1,4,4 stars
RT5BOVH2WLV36,3,They work well. I can use them all through the house.  I gave only 3 stars because they do not stay on well.  It doesn't take much movement for them to slide off.
R13Y2DO301EVB3,5,"This was better than I expected.  After dealing with &#34;TV Ears&#34; which are overpriced and poor performance and quality, these headphones are unexpectedly good.  As an an added bonus, because they use a radio, I can hear the TV from anywhere in the house if I need to go do a quick chore. It also that it will be far more durable and long-lasting than the TV ears.  Well worth the price."
RYE81XOU6GHNC,3,Pretty mediocre product. The charging system works great and the docking system is very good idea. The headphones are very comfortable but do not stay on very well.  The RF seems to have a small amount of interference that creates a constant &#34;hiss&#34; sound. The sound quality is poor at higher volumes regardless of how well they are tuned in.
R2M63V1KOVL0FW,5,Bought this for my elderly mother who is hard of hearing...works great!  No more having to blast the volume on the TV so she can hear the programs...I would highly recommend this item.
R26Q5DI6DNX5NQ,1,"Returning as they only work intermittently! Nice design, other than they have a tendency to slide off smaller heads :-("
R37Y9MXMTUG1MQ,5,work good and sound great
R28FK1X8Y58O2L,5,"I love these headphones I use them everyday for my computer and they work great, I cant recommend these headphones enough im really happy with them."
R15DWKOY30WCFN,5,The headset is somewhat large but the quality of sound and the ease of use make this the best wireless I've used. I can move around the house and even outdoors and still get a clear signal. I originally got them so I could watch football without bothering g my wife.  I wear them even when watching with others so I can have the sound a little higher without others com
R3AOZZM5CHMEJR,4,I would give it 4 1/2 stars as it works very well for me.
R3KBJDB5UFK33D,5,LITTLE CONFUSING TO HOOK UP BUT AFTER THAT COULD NOT BE BETTER!
RZ3MTEM3WOYS3,5,Perfect for the hard of hearing and beats TV Ears hands down.
R2PKASEK8PB88Y,5,"Works great. I can go to the kitchen, next room, and keep listening while getting a snack, and my wife can keep watching the TV."
R1WYNZWO1POVV,4,I bought one a few years back.  It worked pretty good though I wished it had more upper volume range.  I could  walk quite a ways away from the transmitter before the quality of sound deteriorated.  I just bought one for my sister for Christmas.  She loves it.
R8HMCNUJYGJJN,4,Works well
R19ACIKE3I7C8S,4,will fall off your head if you bend over and t is a little sensitive to bass tones on some tv stations. But...works great at at long distances and music sounds good.  overall...good value.
RI9TAM5KCS6UV,5,"I ordered the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones as a gift to my husband who has some hearing loss and keeps the volume so high on the television the dog nearly jumps out of his skin. They work very well, even can get reception from another room. In fact they are so nice I ordered a second headset for myself as I also have trouble hearing the dialog on some TV shows."
R1RGK7D93HBBKL,5,Works great and sounds awesome
R19IAUOAON6PBU,1,Power cord would not fit into base. Design made it impossible to fit the cord properly. Would not power on. Returned
R37JM4AUK88N6K,4,They work well with the TV. We would like them to work with the DVD but can't.
RUDZV03LEOEDF,4,Works Great.  Would highly recommend for the price
R1DHEJXKKE1VL2,3,"Waiting on a converter we had to buy to work with our TV, something about headphones have analog connectors and TV only has digital audio output. Our TV uses Dolby Digital audio. So, we cannot listen to Netflix through our Roku but it works well with regular TV. It's another $100 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LGO1XY6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36<br />Will return if we cannot get it to work."
R2XGL8284ANU02,5,"Fast shipping, and easy to install!  Great buy!"
RXDIXGL643OXN,2,I bought this for my elderly mother as she is hard of hearing. I wanted her to be able to hear her tv. It has been a nightmare. It does not work properly. It can't be tuned effectivly and stay on the correct channel. It is too hard for an older person to manage. When put on the charging base it just messes everything up. I will be returning the device.
R23P58UYMIE9U2,3,"The good: Great sound, clear, deep bass, comfortable, charging unit is a nice design and looks good next to tv. The bad: There is no volume gradation. The sound you hear is either high or low. There are no other levels than that. When I attempt to lower the volume to what I would call a &#34;medium level,&#34; the sound begins to cut out. The good news is that the &#34;high level&#34; is not deafening (and I could even go higher), so it isn't too much of a big deal. I like the unit, but if I had to do it over again, I might choose another maker that produces more sound control."
R3LYBEQJX4J7YA,1,"This is JUNK!  I used these to plug into my guitar amp so as not to disturb the family.  Imagine if you will strumming along with some nice mellow chords, and then PSSPSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTT!!!! as you lose the frequency and it almost blows your eardrum out!<br />I am literally standing three feet from the transmitter and it still loses the signal OVER an OVER and OVER!!!!<br />JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!!  Garbage, CRAP, useless waste of money.<br />They are now in pieces in my trash can.<br /><br />Do NOT buy these!"
R1I20MG1VWUNYG,4,"Very nice wireless headphones!  The range is nice.  I've been able to walk all around a two-story home, even going outside to get the mail and such without noticing any serious changes in quality.<br /><br />Only disappointment is that the charging stand also has the audio cable attached to it, meaning you need to have the stand plugged into both a power outlet and your audio source.  Still, I'm very happy with them, one of the best sets of headphones I've ever owned."
R2NK9TWPOIA6W8,5,THE PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING THAT IT SAID IT WAS. RANGE IS GREAT AND RECEPTION IS CLEAR. WAS A GREAT GIFT FOR MY WIFE.
R3VHK3KWJZ60GP,3,I never had wireless headphones that were not blue tooth before and didn't realize I had to have the base station plug into what I wan'ted to use as a sound source - not a good fit for me. I did return and that was hassle free and I give them high marks for ease of return.
R2LDAJBAPOCQBR,5,"Great wireless headphones.  If you have more than one television, you will need to buy another charging base it two people are watching different programs.  The headset has 3 frequency settings so two people can use them at the same time if they are watching different programs on another television. They last quite a long time. 2-3 years. Then you just need to buy another headset. Range is very good as well."
R1WC89VYG6VM9Y,5,"I can hear tv again without turning the sound up.  Put the tv on mute, put the headphones on a can hear just fine.  Would recommend this for anyone."
R129IS5PA8ODWT,5,Very clear and comfortable
R3L9KGGHN09390,4,Yes
R1XTIORPWXX9TN,5,My husband loves it. He can watch TV while I can go to sleep!
R3TLDBMODDB2W0,4,Excellent for the price
R30PKHGQFSRFGK,5,Very pleased with this product.  Connected easily and the sound is great. Thank you.
R12XYMTCN09NUO,4,"it worked good, I found it better to hear and understand with my hear aids out.  But then with the hearing aid out I can't hear my wife when she talks to me, just hear the TV.  OH and that is not a bad thing."
RUGDAMME63N4U,5,"The headphones are awesome,  Great quality of sound and the range is excellent.  Very pleased with this purchase."
R26DO3BO94C2A2,5,My Mom can hear the TV at her Board and Care Home now.<br />There is a bit of static but I'm not disappointed.
R3PSLMW8AXMW5C,5,"based on my expectations, these headphones are great.  the ear pieces<br />are comfortable, and the sound and tuning are easy to use."
RMIX4GWM0HQKL,3,lots of static when walking around
R2A0UDQ032BUOQ,5,It's good. So far. Only had it for 2 weeks though.
R3C71Y0JO7WTV0,5,"Needed an adaptor cord, but now quite pleased."
RGB9PC42COQAO,4,"It is awesome!!!!!!!! I can go to the kitchen and still hear the tv, without any interference . I can lower the volume on the Tv & still hear it on headphones. It works GREAT!!!!! Best present I got  myself."
RLI1OOQN88YJN,5,My brother loved it! Sound is great and feel great!
R32WR42WMIPKDL,5,"Love this thing.  My second one, wore the first one out.  Far better than their competitor's RF headphones."
R1QOVWBWE93XQ4,2,We did not understand this was just for TV. We needed something that worked for an iPad and a phone.
R32KNJ85M21UNG,1,"It functions, but it is so bedeviled by static as to be useless. I wanted to have a wireless headset to reduce the clutter at my PC; but I could not adjust it to avoid excessive static. So I moved it upstairs to my HDII radio. That was noticeably better, but the settings are so sensitive that moving just a few feet one way or another raised the static. There may be a place where this thing works well, but I haven't found it yet."
R39ALG4E28T7FW,1,I ordered and received two headphones.  Opened and connected one set as per instructions.  Television sound seemed as though it was in the background due to buzzing sound. My neighbor tried them on his sound system and with the same result.....buzzz<br />Never bothered opening the box of the second headphone unit.<br />Returned headphones and promptly received a full refund from Amazon.  Amazon A+....Sennheiser D-
RKOJFWK9DQF5K,5,"This has been the best purchase we ever made at Amazon. My husband and I have my mother living here as well, but she is on a totally different schedule and the tv in the living room was keeping her up. I purchased these to use during those times and it has worked wonderfully.  Very durable and comfortable.  We use these every day and it also keeps me from having to hear my husbands loud shows that I don't necessarily want to watch. Very clear sounding, like being at the movies with surround sound.  Only once in a while will you hear static, and we can even walk to the other side of the house or outside and still hear it perfectly.  I don't know what we would do without them."
R1X8B2A5YD8O5G,2,didn't realize they were for the TV
R2314B0Y5KT5KW,4,"My first one, which was a gift from my daughter, slipped off my head on to soft carpeting as I  leaned forward to pick something up in sitting position (very fragile). It hasn't worked since, that is why I ordered another one. Other than that, I love it, wouldn't want to be without it."
R23BY2R100HMPN,5,"Now I understand why I had the TV turned up.  These headphones are wonderful. They provide a full spectrum of sound, they are comfortable to wear.  I had trouble get an audio signal from my TV,. but finally got one from the cable box."
R1WGE7W63IMU8D,5,"Bought this for my wife so she can watch tv while I sleep.  She says they work excellent!!  Also found I could plug them in to the back of of the cable box rca jacks without affecting my HDMI feed to the tv or the optical sound feed from cable box to the sound bar.  As much as she loves them, I like them even more as I can sleep in a quiet room."
R3OS8BTRW68DCH,3,"Bought to replace a Sony RF970R which finally gave up the ghost after many years of satisfactory service.  This low cost Sennheiser is ok for the money but nothing to write home about.  The sound is good - not great -rather thin on the bass, great with dialogue though.  I use it when watch TV or on the computer.  Wireless is the way to go when watching because you will need to move around.  They are powered by 2 internal AAA lithium batteries, rechargeable. Can last all day on a single charge.  First charge is overnight (typical).  Range is good, all over the house and out into the back yard.  I do prefer RF to Bluetooth any day.  These operate at 900 Mhz.  Trouble is that after an hour they hurt my ears and adjusting them doesn't help. I have an very average size head - wear a size 7 1/8 fedora.  Automatic frequency adjustment (that can be changed manually if you so choose).  It will pickup stray telephone calls or radio signals occasionally so that's handy.  All told, not a bad headset for the money IF they didn't hurt my ears.  That's just too bad."
R23CAIMED3AP7K,3,"Very good unit that performs well, good sound reproduction, good distance reception when out in the yard. The minus is that it is unstable on your head, keeps falling off when head is tipped forward or sideways."
R1MKJM8D2QAK5C,4,"I really like these.  I can watch TV late without waking the family  Nice sound quality, decent price.  4 stars because no digital connection, and unfortunately no RCA output from my TV.  Hooking to the headphone jack causes TV speakers to go out on my LG TV, with no option to change the TV's setting.  This is more a TV fault than the headphones, and the headphone jack is inconveniently located on the TV as well.  Hooking to the cable box causes a slight lag between the speaker's lips and the sound, which drives the spouse crazy but I can tolerate.  There is no setting to change the lag like on my sound bar.  And, if I want to watch a Blue Ray movie I have to change the connection to the Blue Ray player. But again, these are more faults with the TV than the headphones.  With the headphones, I can walk anywhere in my house and still hear the TV.  There is occasional static, but usually because I've bumped the tuner on the headphones."
R32UBR1FWL5LRU,5,bought this used about 3 years ago. Still going strong!
RO594REX4LKXU,5,"Work very well, this is my second set and they are for my wife.  I will not watch TV without them."
RF4YK0EUO3R9D,5,"This is a terrific product!<br />I have hearing issues which drive my wife nuts.  I turn the volume way up, and still frequently can't make out the speech in whatever I'm watching.  The problem worsens if characters have accents.<br />With these headphones, I can hear every single word quite clearly.  And with our house being a very open plan, being able to listen to one thing while my wife is watching something else upstairs means neither of us hears what the other one is listening to.<br />I haven't found the limits to the distance on these, but I can leave and go into adjacent rooms and still hear just as well as if I was sitting in front of the TV.  Very convenient when you want to grab a snack!<br />I'm going to have to discuss this with my audiologist, who told me the type of hearing problems I have wouldn't be helped with a hearing aid.  If these headphones can give me this type of sound clarity, I think it's obvious he's wrong!"
R2JQNC3UFVJ4L1,4,Beats the hell out of tv ears
R1R3XFSALINLAZ,2,"One of the worst purchases i've made in recent memory. These headphones are of course wireless and much cheaper than many competitors, but there is a reason.<br />To put it simply, they operate off a radio signal which not only can change based on your position (yes you have to change the tuner on the earpience) but also can pick up other people who have the same headphones in the office (they are popular, it can happen).<br /><br />Overall, wearing them is torture and the RF tuning makes the sound quality dubious. If you want wireless, spend your money and get a real pair."
R3VORUO0EG6NVW,5,Great listening for hubby and right volume for wife.
R3R0UXN436456Z,2,"I purchased this to play with my Bass off my stereo and Rocksmith 2014.  Unfortunately, the frequency must be similar to the bass itself and the frequency of the TV.  Seems like if I move in one direction or another during any moment, the volume goes out.  This would be much better if they provided a digital signal over the analog signal.<br /><br />I will have to keep trying."
R3TMX1EY2ORXNM,5,"My husband has only 1 problem with them , and that is he can't keep them from falling off his head when he bends over, He has added a strap to go around the back of his head to keep them on. The sound quality is excellent and he sure enjoys them as do I."
R22ITI98RO58WM,5,Great headphones for using on the treadmill.
R3E0CWJ1UVCHBA,4,"We almost sent them back, but now they now work fine.  The issue is the output from our TV was controlled by the TV Volume and Mute.  After researching the web site, I discovered that I could set the audio output to &#34;Fixed&#34;.  I give it only 4 stars because I shouldn't have needed to view a video to learn this, it could have been in the included doc...it may also fix the problems of the folks who have hissing issues and distance issues.<br /><br />Explanation:  The earphone controller turns on when it senses the TV sound is ON.  This is a good feature, but if the sound is weak the earphone controller shuts off.  When attached it to an output jack that is controlled by the TV volume, the device sometimes senses the signal and sometimes doesn't.  Cranking up the volume doesn't seem to help...although that is describe as a &#34;fix&#34;.  In my Sony TV (and I assume others) the &#34;HOME&#34; menu allows a setting of the audio output to &#34;fixed&#34; .  This provides a consistent signal and the controller doesn't shut off.  Once I set this to &#34;fixed&#34; the control unit turns on immediately when the TV comes on, the distance is much longer and there is no hiss.<br /><br />Bottom line, look for a setting in your TV setup that sets the audio output to &#34;fixed&#34; thus bypassing the TV's volume controls, you may find these headphones much more to you liking.<br /><br />. audio out (RCA jack on back of TV) can be driven through the TV amplifier or provide a  on newere TV's allows"
R2L0K6NSR62AYW,5,"Works great, comes with all the connections necessary to plug in to the TV and has good sound."
R2QULJWSSABNTG,5,"This is my second set for another TV. The new TVs lack speaker strength. You'll never miss dialogue again, especially British TV shows. The RS 120 headphones are very suitable for your daily TV watching. We could not be more pleased with ours. The price is right as well."
R2MDC0RM66CN11,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE THESE HEADPHONES!!!<br /><br />First off, lets address the actual headphones. They are so outdated and ugly, that you look like an alien while wearing them. They release ridiculous amount of noise on the outside. I was using them with my keyboard 30 feet away from my brother (on a medium volume) and he repeatedly complained about the noise.  Ear panels are the complete opposite of sturdy on these flimsy headphones.  Also, good luck getting the adjustment bars to stay in place, it takes them 20 minutes to slip off my head. Also, I heaved often used recording DJ grade headphones when rehearsing guitar and piano songs (which are quite large) and these headphones FAR outweigh them. And, let's not mention the width. They are a FOOT AND A HALF LONG. Try keeping them on your head.<br /><br />The Transmitter: The transmitter is a big, heavy, light grey quarter circle shape which is outrageously ugly and ruins the feel of any space that it is placed in. When you receive it there is one cord plugged in already AND you have to plug in another, which releases TWO AV cords which have to be plugged into an adapter which then must be plugged in to a separate extension if you want to plug it in to a headphone jack.<br /><br />Charging: Charging takes anywhere from 8-10 hours for a mere HOUR of use. Bottom of the line rechargeable batteries are included which I guess is the least they could do in spite of the of the haphazard packaging and tacky labeling.<br /><br />In conclusion DO. NOT. BUY. If there was a 0 star review these measly headphones would be receiving one."
RVCKL1350EST,5,"Bought these as a gift for my father who is slightly hard of hearing.  We've gone through a few sets in the past that worked OK, but wore out after a while, but being in a new house and once again killing everyone with the TV volume, we went looking for a new set.<br /><br />These have turned out to be fantastic.  Audio quality is great, range is fantastic, set up is simple and the recharging feature of the transmitter is very convenient.  The only downside is that my father reported that the headphones were a bit warm after a few hours of use.  In a typical evening, this likely wouldn't be an issue, but during the holidays and all-day football watching, the traditional non-vented cup design can become warm on the ears."
R13QLI8YGTEQQ7,4,"Really like them, only criticism would be the tuning dial is easily turned and requires adjustment."
RYAK7U3ZAWT3H,5,"Outstanding buy, highly recommend"
R2D9I38LLREJE3,5,Marriage savers!!!
R3FSGEKL1CH9T0,5,SUPER
R1DFLBLBLA1T49,4,"Good audio quality and range. The headset is comfortable.  The RF technology requires the user to initially optimize the set-up with a little tuning wheel to get the signal just right.  But once it's tuned in, it stays tuned in and works fine.  Overall good quality for the price."
R21P2M34QAIC5K,4,Would of gave them a five but the headset fits loose. Can't bend your head or they will fall off. So no rockin out.
R1E9JZ5SVIJZ8W,5,"My mom got these for my 60 something year old dad so he would stop asking her questions during a movie/tv show because he couldn't hear what they said. So far these are great. He is more or less technologically handicapped but he set these up all on his own and has watched a few movies with success.  UPDATE: These are still working great, in fact we bought another pair. We put the second base next to the tv in our finished basement so my dad could use them in his bedroom or the basement. You can tune them to whichever base you want so two people can use them in the same room if needed or can be used at the same time on different tv's, we were concerned about that but as I said you can tune them easily. They get great range as well, in case you need to run into the kitchen to grab more popcorn but don't want to pause the show. Now that we have two pairs in the house these get used by everyone. Highly recommend!"
R20BAS2OMJK19O,5,"I received this as a Christmas present and I love them. I owned 2 very cheap pairs previously and every time they accidentally  hit the floor that was it, they were broken. So I said I wanted a nice pair and spend the extra cash for them. Well it was well worth it. I love them."
R3SBO6BQ9WZF7S,5,Works great. i am able to hear it through out the entire house. Good reception. Much better than an older Sony that I was using.
RMKOG5S2J56W,5,Works as expected and has a good sound quality.
R2QLPAHL0VES4D,5,Simply great. I bought this as a gift for my friend and he loves it. I've tried them out myself and can't believe the clarity these headphones are capable of; absolutely no interference with correct adjustment of the tuner. Worth every penny. Oh and it's very simple to use and set up.
R1ID5YT6OR76OT,4,I bought a reconditioned one about 2 years ago and it works great. I just bought a second one for my daughter who is in college and asked for it as a Christmas gift.
R2LHLF4OEJHINM,4,The headphones work great. The hearing problem has been solved.
R27KE2WRTONNZ7,5,mother hard of hearing . she just loves them
R2QFHSJODIKESH,1,"Right side ear has no sound, right out the box.  Returning them back.  The plastic feel cheap and not exactly robust.  Ear pads is a thin foam cushioning, a little hard against the ears.  I'm surprised that Sennheiser put their name on these. Anyways sound quality is very good, at least on the left side, a bit of bass boost."
R1F0GVYFAMD434,5,Great headphones!  I receive clear audio inside or outside.  I would recommend these to a friend!
RFN3XPFY0AQZQ,1,"I did a bit of reading before I bought this as my concern with most wireless headsets are interference, in the end I really don't like it, as I get lots of static/noise interference.  Was a waste of money, I used it maybe 4 times now its gathering dust."
R2M498DABG70JD,5,These were practically a marriage saver. My husband turns up the TV up so loud it runs me out of the room.  They worked wonderfully for 2 years.  We recently changed cable carriers & we have not been able to get them to work properly since.  I don't blame this on the product.  I think we just need some technical help.
R360FQ5QFRPBM0,5,One side speaker was not working but they supplied another headset quickly. It is working well.
R2PT948WTH53AF,1,"As a witeless headset, this one fails badly.  The transmission is such a narrow width that ANY head movement results in loss of sound and input of high static."
R31AFA3O31NORK,1,"I plugged everything in as directed, and made sure the batteries were exactly where they needed to be. The lights did not come on, and the headset did not charge. The placement for the mains on the transmitter is awkward, and the adapter for the RCA plug is too large to fit next to the other outlets on my TV. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a similar product. The idea is awesome, but the execution leaves much to be desired."
R2JYGZJ556O3QA,5,Have it for a while. Works well
R2HTRRYQ4SNPLK,3,Works great but is hard to keep on my head. Needs the padding the others have. Uncomfortable because you have to be carful not to let it fall off.
R3PHBUZ1UGAEER,1,Bought these and returned them within a day. Two things that were deal breakers for me: couldn't get rid of static in my office workplace and also these headphones look horrendously stupid.
RH1U4DVP9VZKD,5,"Saved a marriage (only kidding). Great when someone is watching a loud program and the other person prefers a lower volume from the TV itself, or not to hear it at all. Recommended it to a friend, and it really resolved this issue for his family."
RPIVJ3YOG0JU2,5,"Great function, though they do hurt a little bit after wearing for a while"
R3NBIEDF6GOOCG,4,"Good quality, but can cut in and out"
R2D4GV3IP3Y77E,5,"Outstanding device. I now have three of these for different rooms and TV's.  My 1st set is over eight years old and is still working great.. I highly recommend these for anyone who struggles to hear their TV audio, especially speech.  It sure beats spending hundreds of dollars for a sound bar."
R2UXN3N8K3AFAY,4,Very happy with this purchase.  I plugged this into my cable box. I can listen to the TV only through the headphones or I can listen through the headphones and others can listen to the TV volume. In other words the volumes are separate. You have to use the tune button every once in awhile but it is crystal clear once you line up the tune button. I can walk to the next room and get a snack and still listen to the TV.
RE021FLY087DC,2,"My Husband said the headphones are nice, but he doesn't like tuning them or tuning to often. In that regard I am not fond of them, because they were his Christmas present and he doesn't use them much."
RVRUZV7OBV0HY,4,Purchased for my 94 year old father who has trouble hearing the TV Set.  Installed easily and did not interfere with others who were watching the TV.
R2DCI9UPUUA2DZ,4,"These Sennheiser wireless headphones are nice mid-range choice when considering headphones for everyday listening of TVs or computers. They do not have noise-canceling circuitry and the cups sit on rather than surrounding the ear. Some folks might find that uncomfortable after extended wearing. But once the headphones are set up and the best frequency has been found, these Sennheisers do exactly what they promise - transmit sound clearly to the listener."
R148BFTJYQP7A5,5,good
RTX4NMZIUVN8,5,Love it
R3ET1KL99UVIHK,4,Do you have ears? Great! These headphones will fit well on your head and the sound is great too!
R2QP5QTUE9Q3EB,5,These headphones are crystal clear. The only problem is that now my father-in-law has to wear them every time he comes over to watch football.
RZ1VOJ76WKGVN,5,My husbands favorite Christmas gift! These work sooooo much better than his old &#34;TV Ears&#34; ... no comparison actually. He can roam from room to room as well as go outside without missing a word!
RT15YC7B9ORBS,5,excellent product.
R1HJCRFM8XTOYK,5,"A dream come true, so light weight and super comfortable, and amazing sound quality."
RHDT8GZJXHU45,5,Delivers clear sound while allowing a hearing challenged person to listen to the television.
RAC07DRATHK1,4,"Could not be better.Easy setup right out of the box, Great price too."
R3K2MML1VD0OXF,3,I d id not like the way they felt on my ears. I ended up getting some that covered my ears. I'm sure they function as they should.
RIQSWBLAK34L6,5,"works great on tv, not on computer"
R2Y0HOB2JP4385,5,My husband loves them. They are lighter than the old one had for years.
R2GRSVZP3LC8MX,5,"If you have trouble hearing or understanding TV, these are the ones for you.  I have had two sets and these are the best.  A snap to install and the sound is as clear as a bell.  An absolute must if you are the least bit hearing impaired--or just an added convenience if your hearing is still o.k.  You'll really be pleased."
R19MXZ8YWJYSR4,5,My dad loves these!  Says they have awesome range around the house.
RALGRAKNPQZ4L,5,"Purchased 5 years ago this month and still performs flawlessly.  I got this for my wife who is a night owl that likes to watch tv.  Since I like to read, these headphones are a godsend.  She says the sound is perfect and the only complaint she has (which is a minor one) is sometimes they get a little heavy after extended periods of wearing them.  All-in-all one of the best investments I have ever made."
R2YFYLP5Z9ENMI,5,Bought these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them.
RE17VN0I9T0X1,4,"Earphones works great. I'd give it 5 stars, except they don't stay on head very well. Have to keep re-positioning them.<br />They hold charge , use for about 4 hours every evening and never have run out of battery."
R2MO7328YM2I7P,5,Fantastic sound. Every feature is &#34;as advertised&#34;. The cords are long enough for the most unusual connections.
R186WRH3CWHANL,1,"MUST READ FOR EVERYONE! Terrible product for the modern day. These headphones are not compatible with the majority of modern TVs. I live in the US and have 3 TVs in my house all less than 2-5 years old. Sony, Dynex, and Samsung. The cost of these TVs ranged from $400-1500. These headphones are not compatible with these TVS because they do not have a red and white &#34;audio out&#34; connection on the back of the TV. Since its 2015 I didnt think I still had to check into these type of things before a purchase.....but clearly that was my mistake. This was very frustrating. I could buy an additional $25 converter....but Im just returning this instead. I dont want additional cords hanging off my tv. Complete waste of my time. Also, they are very bulky and remind me of the headphones from the 90s. I would never give these to anyone as a gift since they are quite embarrassing .I really dont understand how these have such great reviews."
R2W4YO06A52TI3,4,Its a nice product. Very useful. Excellent range. Sound quality wasnt up to the company's standards.
R1C5YE01DLPIL6,5,"The quality of sound is amazing.  I have a severe hearing loss, the headphones make it possible for me to watch television and enjoy it without having the sound turned up. Everything is so clear.  They were very reasonably priced for the quality of the product. My wireless Senneiser RS120 wireless headphones were purchased through Amazon."
RSXCEGPR1P8M8,5,Worked great
ROLDWBL50TIG0,4,they work very well.  only negative is they don't stay perfectly on my head when i move around
R3P00CJZ8RYDHO,5,"I got these to replace a similar Sennheiser wireless that my 91 year old mother used. Her old ones gave out after 6 or 7 years. They were the over-the-ear design. This one is an &#34;on ear&#34; style and are much lighter. Like her other Sennheiser, this one transmits exceptionally clear with no static or interferrance. The sound is very clean with decent bass response. I would highly recommend these for anyone who would like to watch TV or listen to stereo while on the go. They also work very well for those who are hard of hearing. They come with a pair of NiMH AAA batteries. We usually got about 1.5 years use on the batteries before they needed replacement. Since they are AAA size, replacement was very inexpennsive."
R16D3W28IG4A8H,2,Too much static and is heavy on my ears. Can't wear it for a long time because I start getting a headache
R3EZFBUWF40ZBP,1,Horrible product - do NOT purchase. Tried this twice and couldn't get either one to work. The power adapter does not connect correctly. This is the first time I have ever rated anything poorly. I am typically too nice. How they charge so much for such a piece of garbage is beyond me.
R1EP4K3V7LS7KF,5,These headsets are great.  I can walk around and still hear the TV.  It's also great for those of us who go to bed early and our husbands stay up and watch TV.
R1EP4Z7W8GDVK1,5,"Use these only for tv listening from about 6 feet away. Used for that purpose, I rate these an 11 on a scale of 10. I tried TV Ears that cost about the same, there is no comparison. These are absolutely fantastic in every way. Sound quality is incredible. I just hope they last as good as they work. I fully endorse these for TV listening."
R1LOG9PHJV109L,5,Nice
R2GTR1BNBPHCET,5,"I bought these for my mother. She is vision and hearing impaired. Though she has hearing aids, she has difficulty understanding sounds. She was delighted with the headphones, and said she could hear the TV clearly! I listened with them also, the I thought the sound was so much better than her TV. She travels into other areas of her apt. wearing them as well, and doesn't miss anything.There is one slight problem. Occasionally there is static, and I couldn't tell you the cause. Overall, I'm extremely happy that since my mother can't see the TV, she can now hear it! I may have to order a set for myself."
RYHUVKRL07YU7,5,"Purchased for my son - he loves these headphones. Beautiful, clear sound even at the furthest point in our house from his transmitter, almost 60 feet and 4 rooms away."
R18E9B9EZ7DMOI,5,Another great value from Sennheiser.
R3QJ6JBFV6357H,5,does the job
R3AXBH44VXX2MM,1,"My child enjoyed using the headset so she could watch her shows without everyone else needing to listen as well. We did have to adjust the frequency according to whether or not she was watching Netflix or watching a DVD.  And having to re adjust the frequency every time she used it is disappointing.<br /><br />Within a couple of weeks the  headset stopped charging. The base was on, but the headset itself would not charge when I put it on the base.  When I checked today there wasn't even a power light to designate that the base was at least plugged in.  It just seems like it was a waste of money for a product that poorly performed and was completely non operational within a couple of weeks of receipt.  I really don't know what to do at this point except to throw it away.  The item was a gift so I can't just provide proof of purchase on the manufactures web site.  And I don't want to replace the product with another headset that will break again after a couple of weeks."
R11BH0KSAVF4Q3,5,"Got this for my dad because he is constantly asking &#34;what'd he say?&#34; In the middle of the movie. This is great, adjustable volume, but not completely sound canceling so he can still hear us if we need to get his attention."
R83PL2SVVVQSF,5,"It has been a &#34;wife saver&#34;. Being married to a man who loves to turn the TV volume up, &#34;not because he can't hear&#34; this is worth every penny. I can watch TV with him and we are both happy with the sounds. Was surprised that he likes it and uses it often. He is not one to accept new things but this works so well that I had no trouble getting him to use the headphones. The setup is easy and waiting until the headphones charge is the hardest part.<br />Very happy with the purchase"
R2FSI40DM1F42S,5,Excellent listening enhancement for not much money. Quite a bargain.
R3GW9B26F9X8NX,3,"Great Sound but headset to big for my head and slip off my head whenever I move.  I purchased tow pairs one set for each TV, I guess I'll need to get my Sony TV headsets back out (a lot of static been used for a couple of years).  I hate wearing hearing aids and TV Headsets are hard to find these days. Wish these would of worked for my head size because the sound was excellent."
R2PV000FNJ1W13,5,"Great wireless headphones, got second pair as gift!"
R2UB3XR2S8DWE,5,These headphones are exactly what I was hoping for.  It took me under 5 minutes to set them up to my TV and the sound is very clear.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
RFLIVX2HWZTV4,5,Best purchase ever for hubby! Recommended to all our family and friends. Marriage saver....
R1WDNX4Z68WVFG,5,I have two sets off these earphones and they work great.
RALPJW1HER2XR,3,"Bought it for my dad and he wasn't very fond of it. Quality sound was good but the comfort wasn't. After 30 minutes of using it, it was already becoming uncomfortable mainly because it doesn't go over your ear but lands right on top of them."
R113N0HMEBQE4O,2,"At first I was very happy with the [[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Dock]] but, after using them for 2 months, the transmitter unit died and I just found out that I can't return them because the return window only lasted for a month. As a  result, I will have to be very hard up for a particular item before I will consider buying anything else from Amazon."
R1NGU02PODCZFO,5,works well
R2XV4T90LG6HFL,5,I can sleep in peace and he can watch TV all night……perfect product!
R36GCCD8S8XXG4,5,works well Long range. Surround effect is nice
R2P924O6TEN3RG,3,"I've owned a set of this brand from several years ago. I don't recall if they were RS120's or higher. They were great. These are OK. I had to replace the first new set I ordered, as it was dead on delivery. The replacement Amazon sent did function OK though. The set up of these is a bit complicated. The quality of the construction is very light weight.<br />  Sometimes they function really well and the stereo sound at night is spooky-ily great (5 Stars). I turn to hear noises, that I think are coming from my home, only to find out it is coming from a movie, that I'm watching, on my TV.<br />  On the my old ones (of this brand, which grew legs and walked away, while working just fine for several years) I only had to set the channel pick up on them once and that was it. On the new lighter duty ones however,  I often have to reset the channel adjustments several time an evening, for receiving acceptable sound balance and volume. That's why I only gave it only 3 Stars.<br />  On a good night, on the same TV & in the same location, they are excellent, but on another night, they are just OK. I'll have to see how they work out in the long run. I would recommend buying a higher number then the 120 model, if I were to do over again though."
R2F2YUZH3SZP6I,5,"Every thing I expected them to be.<br />Works perfectly for TV, I can actually make out the words without closed captions now."
R15R5S1PW5R25T,5,"I bought these quite a while ago and never wrote a review. These headphones are fabulous and worth every penny. It may even save your marriage (ha-ha) because you can listen to a movie as loud as you want and it won't disturb anyone. I haven't had any problems at all. In fact, I had them on my head when I went to the bathroom (not to miss a second of what I was watching). We'll, the headphones dropped in the toilet (ewww). But to my surprise, after they dried off, they still kept working. Someone asked a question about batteries for the headphones. I cannot see any place to put a battery. The headphones charge on the unit that is plugged into the wall. It's like charging a cell phone. I have had these headphones for at least five years with no problems."
R1HI2APSIOJZZP,5,Works very well
R385PUYMZAEWDO,5,"I notice some of the buyers complain about that they have a tendency to fall off your head when you bend down, or move around. It happened to me the first 2 weeks, and I kind improve it now. It's adjustable and before you put it on your head, stretch it and make it comfortable, then  done! Of course if you keep head down and dancing, if will keep on falling! Good product"
RGD7C24YY3M2K,1,"The headsets arrived and the stand didn't work. I plugged it in but couldn't get any power. Tested multiple adapters and outlets, nada."
R1N1T3C0U68RI3,4,There is static sometimes.  otherwise they are great.
R38SWEGGES82PK,5,"Even after all this time the original batteries that come with it even still work. I did buy a couple more longer lasting ones, that way if you forget to re-charge them, they still last for days. VERY happy with the quality and sound !!"
R3Q8I8U3K710YC,5,Excellent product!
R3E0IZCFZPM12Z,1,"It was not compatible with my Sony TV.  I could not get the  audio to work.  It was all connected, but no sound"
R20DMA3GAP4XJ,1,"After getting these set up and tuned in as static-free as possible, I ran a side-by side with my $16 no-name gaming headset. The cheapo gaming headset had better bass, clearer audio, and less sound leakage.<br /><br />There are some serious technical limitations that I think are dating these headphones.  The most obvious is that the base requires a 3.5mm to RCA adaptor, which is included. IT NEEDS AN RCA ADAPTER? really? Does Sennheiser know what decade we're in? Also, there's A F#$king Tuning dial. I'm 34 years old, so I at least know what one of those is but the last time I needed one I wasn't yet old enough to rent a car. We have digital technology now, devices can find signals on their own now, and can do a better job. These headphones, in spite of costing $80, are way out of date. There's some serious sound leakage because the pads are made out of 90's era foam. It's the vintage stuff that breaks down really quickly and sucks in general. Even brandless headsets use better materials in this decade. If you plan on using these in a room with another person, that person will likely be stuck listening to whatever you've got playing. I didn't bother to take these apart, but I would suspect that the internal components are just as low end and dated.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not much of an audiophile, but I use a lot of headphones for work and gaming. These are some of the worst I've ever used. They're significantly inferior to $&lt;20 studio monitors and are so crappy that there's no point in even comparing them to anything decent.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />After examining the reviews more closely, it's pretty clear that these ARE dinosaur headphones. The most useful 3-star review is almost a decade old. Shame on Amazon... they should crop old reviews after a few years!"
R2OLO99B3JHCSK,4,"Good sound. Has all required adapters  for normal audio output. However many new TV's no longer have RCA jack output. External connection use HDMI connection for external amplifiers. Then this input to the headset must be connected to the satellite device or DVD player, meaning you have to reconnect each time."
RMI10BNM3OYCR,5,"Nice Comfortable head phones light weight and very clear sound , I use them in another room to get with the TV sound turn off"
RDT4O8EJKXHXV,5,"Perfect for watching tv and playing video games. While watching tv all you have to do is plug the headphones into your cable box and it will go through the speakers and headphones. When playing video games hook it to the av output to your tv, then to menu on your tv and then got to audio and switch from tv speakers to av receiver and then enjoy. I did notice a slight humming but this can be easily tuned out. Great price and great product."
RALX31970OEJA,5,Work and fit well. apid charge. Woul have liked to use for TV but no way to hook up.
R394BAN7101VQC,5,great soynd and very comfortable on your ears
R2U3BBIIBU7L24,3,Does not contact charging connections when mounted as shown. If you turn the base upside down the headphone charging contacts will contact the charging bars as they hang. Sound is good for wireless. Used mostly 10 ft or less from base.
R2XL0GHVRKFEO3,5,works perfectly great sound
RABRZSG5T6Q44,4,good price and fast delivery
R392MQCEIDYJWI,1,"Very disappointed, it was not what I ordered.  They only work with TV not with music."
R2UCRVGAK81YMY,5,My wife loves them (and she isn't the one using them!).<br />I can hear the dialogue and everything else that I could not hear with the poor quality sound that came with my Vizio TV!<br />Price was discounted too!
R1CDTRR55ZSXW7,4,Was a gift and she loved it.
R9KWYV6XF2D76,5,Perfect.
R1JIPNFKR96YS2,4,"These are excellent wireless headphones.. I use them for watching HDTV , sound separation etc. very good.. One major drawback .. The internal wiring has shorted out and thus sound is intermittent..and when you try to adjust the volume..when it comes back on It will blow you out of your pants.  treat them delicately!Vhanged to new batteries etc.. SORRY CHARLIE!"
RGPVEPG62N6KH,5,This headset is fantastic! It's still working perfectly a year after purchase. It's been a total lifesaver for me since I fall asleep earlier than my husband and he likes to watch TV in bed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
R2F4Z0VVU1XSH8,3,I bought two sets.  The volume goes loud and soft without warning - even after changing channels.  I'm not sure what to do.
R1Q5UHHJ9NZ6TS,5,Great product!
R2YC170FEXK82L,5,"This is the second set I bough since I had hearing problem from TV. The sound quality is clear and crisp as always, but they made an improvement on this one: They use rechargeable batteries (enclosed) to the machine so that you don't have to change batteries frequently. The two metal bars that hold the headset is literally a battery charger, a clever design."
R1C9HIXI7KI4ME,5,Work great and sound is awesome.
R2ROXVPRZH7YKF,1,"Unfortunately, I cannot return this item as I purchased it too long ago. It doesn't work. We tried every channel, tuning the headset, moving the base, nothing. All you hear is static. 4 of us have tried it--an electrical engineer and a computer programmer included. Not sure if we just got a dud or what, but I'm disappointed with the lack of customer support from the seller and the product itself. Look for other headphones."
R2L8U0F6H6IJDL,5,"My wife got me these because my Sony Headphones were worn and tattered.  This is a great set of headphones. the volume is sharp and the range is great.  I would highly recommend these for anyone that needs higher volume with a spouse that does not.  The only con to these headphones is they have a tendency to fall off your head if you are moving around. However, they are worth the inconvenience!!!"
R31FBSKIZCAZSI,5,"I had one of these for about 7 years and broke it due to rough handling, dropping and sleeping on it.  I went looking for a replacement and kept coming back to this one.  Since I had such a good experience with it, I just got another.  It has great range, even through walls and floors.  I used it mostly at night in bed as not to wake the wife.  I love the clarity of sound and stereo separation these provide. On the old ones, the battery stopped holding a charge after a few years, not a problem as these use standard sized AA rechargeable batteries:  I had some laying around and the switch was easy.  I have gone a couple days with out charging them, but only when I forget to put them back on the cradle.  These are great, in fact I bought a pair for my dad as a Xmas present."
R1HXWASP5U934S,5,Love the headphones and the fact I can walk out  of the room to get something and still hear the audio.
R2ECNQXHSX7IN6,5,These work great.  My husband uses them all of the time.
R1O9AX07TOMPK,5,Great headphones
R19T9IDMTYY8RA,3,"The headphone system works great.<br />The big problem is the recharging- the batteries are in one side of the headphones making their &#34;balance&#34; off- as a result they won't sit level on the recharging station, which causes a bad connection and failure to charge.<br />Tired of fiddling with them to get them to charge- great idea but very poor implementation."
R38URKJ8BQS5MX,3,"They seem to work well for the most part.  They can get a bit of static that has to be periodically adjusted, but they give good long range from the computer.  My major complaint is that they have a loud hiss when they haven't received a sound signal for a brief period of time, or when they are first turned on and no sound has yet started."
R3ASGPBGQ3GRGW,1,"This may be OK for people who are simply looking to listen to TV without disturbing their partner who don't expect 100% fidelity, however the constantly electronic hiss/pop of the sound coupled with the white background noise makes these headphones absolutely dreadful for people who are trying to appreciate their music.<br /><br />The reason for this is because it operates on a wireless spectrum similar to your wireless router (except at 900 MHz), it doesn't 'pair' with your headphone and as such, you are simply a receiver just like a radio. While this gives you massive range improvements over bluetooth, I wouldn't recommend moving with it (such as cleaning or walking around your house) because it is crazy noisy as the sound cuts in and out.<br /><br />Also the auto mute on/off switch was a horrible idea. If for whatever reason your audio cuts out and it goes silent, it will hit you with a blast of static comparable to a mosh pit after it auto deactivates the transmitter."
R3SNG8F5LQ6BIH,4,great headset but a little noise gets in around the edges
R1T9WEM8AFNH5G,5,"2014 Christmas gift for my wife that does a lot of crafts. She is always on YOUTUBE. This is just what she needed. She can watch the video, get up and refill coffee cup and not miss a beat. Found no issues with recharging as mentioned in other rvws. We did upgrade batteries to provide linger life cycle."
R3M6Z7DQGYUMXF,1,Head phones work great as long as you sit still they slide of real easy so I would only recommend them for watching while you are sitting. They sound great and are comfortable.<br /><br />Update These crapped out on me in less than a year don't waste your money
R1RUIRIGJJGJH0,5,Amazing sound.  Good quality.
RE1JBIJ5PZTND,5,Wow  Excellent
RJTKXQU80R3P0,4,Great product. Son- in -law wears them constantly
R2VNX19L0WKEO4,5,These headphones are incredible!!! I can now hear the TV and the wife is no longer ticked. Great bass response watching concert DVD's. Easy set up and a great price.
R13URLYIIPX1RJ,1,"I bought these so I could listen wirelessly while working or using a treadmill. I have attached the device to my Kindle,my iPod, and my Mac. It works great on all three...if I only want to listen through my right ear. The left ear phone does not function, not even the hiss reported by some reviewers. I am returning the unit and will buy a different brand from a local vendor. Very disappointed.     Updated Jan 19, 2015: When I saw Amazon's option to return and replace the defective item, I decided to give it a try. The return and replace process through Amazon worked well. However, the replacement item sent to me by Sennheiser was even worse than the original. Neither headphone functioned at all. In addition, it was obvious that the replacement was not a new item. One adapter plug was missing. Items were loose. Tie strings lay untwisted in the box. Batteries were already installed. Items had been removed from their plastic bags. Sennheiser is an embarrassment to Amazon and should be avoided. Beware."
RGETLOFPTY07W,5,Awesome product.  They are lightweight over your head and they have at least a 300 foot range from the headphone stand.  The stand serves as a recharger for batteries.  The headphone receives its signal from the stand.<br />I highly recommend them for anybody heavily into music.
R3D1JYUEFJVI4U,5,Sound quality is fantastic!
RXWK3OO2KJNI0,2,"I wanted these to work well so badly, but they were just very staticy and hard to tune.  They were not that easy to hook up either."
R1H139A0H7QSEJ,5,Great for when you don't want to bother your wife while watching a game. Great sound and reception.
R3M77PJ4WDMXOG,5,Quick delivery and product as described.<br />Really like the ability to alter the channel if there is any interference.<br />Also like the easy access to volume control and fine tuning.<br />This is the answer for anyone who wants a wireless headset and doesn't have bluetooth on their TV.
R1DWBJM0Z9FPTJ,5,I have to have this this week
R2MZ03MXYBXEVN,4,"AS an engineer of Electronics I am blown away by the performance of these headphones. In layman terms the hiss and static is gone and the  stereo separation is as good as it gets! No problem of reception anywhere in my house. No complaints about the performance and would give it a perfect 10 except the material (foam) used in the ear-pad. I would prefer a supple and better fitting leather pad which would be longer lasting and a more secure positing.. If money is not critical, look to them for upscale models having better ear pads."
R3PGQ46WXVU2P3,5,Great headphones.  Awesome being able to watch movies late at night without bothering anybody!
R19LC6JGR8T41M,5,These work very well for what I needed them for. I bought them to attach to the TV. I'm a little hard of hearing and if there are other noises going on it gets hard to hear the TV. These solved that problem very well and I don't have to sit there and keep asking &#34;what did they say&#34;.
R1AYG06SZJUJTD,2,"Headphones worked well for a few weeks, then all of the sudden the base turns off and super loud static ensues.  Mine turn off when there is sound transmitting from the video not like the other reviewers that complain of an auto shutoff.  I contacted Sennheiser and their fix was for me to purchase a hdmi sound cable.  They should replace the base, which is an action I will pursue.  The head set is comfortable for a while but doesn't fit great."
R2DN7N2HUMA49K,5,Bought these for my husband for Christmas because he had a less expensive pair that stopped working and he can't believe the crystal sound coming from them. He's very happy which makes me happy!!
R163IAYSUU9L1,1,"I tried to get these to work on 2 different TV's. Nothing but a loud hissing noise. I watched several YouTube videos on setting up these wireless head phones but still no luck. As to the quality of these phones I think they are well designed , unfortunately they are a product of china and made of very cheap materials and did not work for me. I bought these wireless headphones for my mother who is hard of hearing and needs something to help with hearing the TV. I will look for anther product and keep my fingers crossed."
RIDN4UD6112DX,3,"A bit static-y, a bit plastic-y, drops signal if source is paused or muted for more than a few minutes...overall a bit quirky."
R2QUG84ATPNAPY,5,Got the headphones for my elderly mother to help her hear the TV…She had broken several sets of TV Ears as that product is very fragile.  She is very happy with these.  Easy to charge and blocks out other noises.  Sturdy and well made.
R2KYOTFQSKL4DX,4,Easy to use; great sound quality; good range of distance from source.
R2QS93WZ4BHR2T,1,Tried it on 2 tvs. Tried all stations it would never tune enough to be clear. I even you tubed it with installations and all but would always end up where I can hear it but its so shuffled you couldnt make out words. The worst so far
R2ZP54JPG7UNH4,5,My 85 Year Old mother loves these and they work better than her hearing aids while watching TV.  She can hear the TV clearly and it eliminated the TV volume being on 55.
R110Z50RIJ0RQ4,5,I have been using these head set for several years an when I upgrade to a newer set the seem to get better.
R37XPY2DII7SHS,5,"I've only used this a day but it works wonderfully.  No static and it worked over 100 feet without any static and respectable well over 300 feet away.  Packaging was good and contrary to some reviews, the headset sits nice on the charger.  Hook up was simple and fast."
R20BYDN4L243BX,3,worked with my LG tv & a blue ray dvd player
R1LATIHOOE2DAC,3,"sound fair crackles some, headset flimsy, power port hard to access"
RL8G3SJU3PTLH,1,"The signal quality and the amount of feedback that I get with these is very disappointing, No matter how much I tune or which of the 3 channels I switch to, I still get a faint hissing noise. Next is the charging station, it times out after 3-5 minutes if nothing is playing and rather than just shutting off to conserve battery power I get blasted with loud static. The ear pads are thin and you can feel the plastic ridges on your ears. This makes them almost impossible for them to be worn for more than an hour at a time. The adapter for the 3.5mm plug is really wide and bulky which begs the question, why not a short cable? This is the 5th pair of Sennheiser's I have purchased and this is the first time I have been disappointed. The sound quality is one of it's few redeeming qualities but a timid quality at best. I know Sennheiser concentrates more on clarity and sound fidelity but these seem to lack any kind of bass from what I can tell. The high end and mids are pretty good but that should be a given for Sennheiser.    At $65 on a lightening deal these aren't even close to worth it and $129 retail they are a joke.    Update: The headphones now have a faint popping noise that doesn't go away no matter what channel it's on or how much I tune it. I hope this is my unit and not something that Sennheiser was willing to ship out. I am now returning them for a refund."
R2M587SI94P0NY,5,Marriage saver
RQ0YJXUVSAXB8,5,these work great.  Sure does help a lot when you are both watching TV.  Saves arguing
RR5HURAW7Q3UL,5,Makes speech from TV so much clearer.
R22NCAUOE2GX43,4,No hissing like others say they hear.  Nice and peaceful when I dont want to hear husbands TV  Nice to have the charging station right there.  Good sound and easy to locate adjustments.  I would buy again
R16FM2KJBI2VJN,5,"Excellent headphones. Clear sound. Very stylish design. To charge, just place the headsets on the cradle (as shown in pics), and it charges through those silver support where it sits  on it. I have taken these to upstairs and the sound was still clear. Sound (volume) can be controlled through a button on the right side of the headset, and the volume can be pretty loud if you want. I normally set it on the lower side. Shall buy one more headset from Sennheiser."
RKUGFD83N08RV,5,The Sennheiser Wireless Headphones work great.  I would highly recommend them.
R1UGA2XJCO9YIQ,5,My husband loved the sennheiser wireless headphones. He can go out on the patio and still listen his show or football.  He has had this set before but after a few years they died and so I ordered him another pair.  They are also very helpful if you want to go to bed he will be wearing these headset and I cannot hear the TV.  That is a plus.
R2VJJ6C91G9C6Y,4,"It works well.  I don't like the charging cradle or the need for frequent adjustments.  I had to adapt to it rather than the reverse.  Overall, it's a good headset."
R3V3Y5V0I1M916,4,"I'd say these are better suited to classical music than hip-hop. And that suits me just fine. Great clarity. If you want to blow out your eardrums, get a Dr Dre or something. One star subtracted for annoying hiss when input source stops, and another for having to carefully tune it, and for constant low background hiss. I guess I'm saying I wish they were bluetooth. Still, these are my main cans."
R3K3MADDZIRQS0,4,Excellent product and very good sound. Quite happy with the unit and would recommend anybody to have one for hearing problem<br />while watching tv
R1QF9YZA2HSW39,5,"This review will be based on if you use these earphones mostly when you are lying down. If you have a small head there gonna fit you loose. If you have medium head (thats my size) they fit ok, meaning not too tight not too loose. If you have a large head well they're gonna fit perfect, meaning a nice snug to get that full bass sound! So now, the bigger the head the better the sound. Since i have a medium size head the sound is still pretty damn good considering that they are not completely pressed against my ears. There is no way to adjust them from side to side but you can adjust them top to bottom. There is a tune dial on the earphones that i worried about when i first got them but really just find the right channel and the tune dial will adjust perfectly to that channel. The distance doesn't seem to be a problem from the receiver to the headphones so far and i have a 3 story house."
R1QXCARQRGU63R,1,Big disappointment - headphones did not work at all.
R1KR6216FKKJO5,4,"The sound quality is good and the setup is easy so far.  The only glitch with it that I can see so far is that it isn't tight on my head as much as I would like it to be.  Actually forgot it was on and bent over and the phones fell off and hit the floor.  The ear pieces are flat and don't fit around the ears like 'normal' headphones that I am used to wearing.  I see no way to secure them more tightly.    Update:  I've found if I wear a hat and put the phones over the hat that they don't fall off any more.  Individuals not as follicle challenged as myself may not have the issue of it falling off so easily.  I do wear them all over the house and in the garage, so the range is not too bad.  I have to adjust the frequency control a bit."
R2BJW9YSS5RPTH,5,Got these from my wife for Christmas hooked them up great sound easy hook up comfortable to wear
R1R3TFHQN1YOJV,2,"Sound is ok, Battery life is short. not worth the money."
R7MA79NXXJCHL,4,"I've had this product for about two years now and it's still getting pretty good use. The connection can be a little hard to get perfect sometimes (the actual wireless connection) but the quality when they are working right is dead on, I think it's a tad over priced but it's been sturdy and reliable for awesome sound."
RK3XHRNLY9MOM,1,"[[ASIN:B000EBPJCO Sennheiser HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System]]Not impressed at all. All I hear is hiss, the few times anything is heard.  Can not tune to hear anything from TV. The only way to get the charge to light up, is to apply slight pressure to headphones. The on /off light doesn't work most of the time.  Really?  Thanks Sinnheiser, for a great Christmas!  This is my first time purchasing a Sennheiser product, & it will be my last.  The only good thing about this experience, is the ease Amazon allows them to be returned.  5 stars to Amazon."
RZ5P9OEWPAOXV,5,they are wonderful
R3U9E350H65LB3,3,"I sent mine back. As others have said, the design and sound (if you have a clear signal) are not bad, but there is too much hiss to listen to music comfortably. I also found they pick up my neighbor's TV more clearly than my own stereo, so I had to keep switching channels on the transmitter base and adjust the tuning dial on the headphones. I was hoping for something I could enjoy without constant adjustment, but this was not it."
R2UX9YW48VPQ8G,5,"This is the third or fourth set of these I've had. They're great, and while I've tried other brands, there's nothing like these for quality, ease of re-charging or ruggedness.  Having had a lifelong hearing loss, these allow me to hear what other hear in watching TV. (...junk and all....)"
R2WYKTN3TD8AJ0,1,"The RF transmitter (base station) complete quit after about 1/2 an hour. No lights, nothing. I was NOT super impressed by them in the 1/2 hour that they did work but would have used them anyways. The sound level was fairly low even with the tv at full and 80% volume (the point where it didn't get any louder, just more distorted). The headphone cups are not parallel so don't seal around the ears well. The audio quality was about on par with an A.M. radio station played thru a 3&#34; speaker in a 1956 VW. Definitely not up to Sennheiser's wired headphone quality."
R3OIL8GIDZO1LC,5,great does not bother others works like hearing aids for me
R1XBV0O8UTX94C,4,"Works well.  Mutes my tv when plug them into the tv.  Probably a way to override this. I Even though the tv is mute, when the headphones are on low volume I get a slight white noise.  When I increase the tv volume the noise clears up.  At the price I paid for them $60 they are worth the money."
R2ARQB2B7DJTVB,1,It didn't work on 2different TVs with RCA jacks.
R9W0KFUMNENA8,4,These are great for privacy listening to TV.  They work very well and have excellent reception. I have two pair now for different TVs.  I am also hearing impaired and these allow me to not blast everyone out of the room with the volume switch on the TV/receiver remote!
R3T7TZRGYM2YZG,5,I've had these for years.  The foam is still holding up and I wear them about 70 hours a week.  They are 900 Mhz so they can cover my whole yard which is an acre.  I can't even walk into the next room without my bluetooth quitting.
R2Z25CLL5DESX0,1,Returned all static bought Sony
R3NMTPRHDY4BGY,5,"Absolutely the best item I've ever found on Amazon.  After years of being exposed to loud noise, my hearing is what you would kindly call &#34;less than optimum&#34;.  As a result, I usually have the Tv cranked up so loud my wife is ready to scream.  These headphones have completely changed my ability to enjoy TV.  My wife now turns the volume down on the set by 50% and I have complete control through the volume control on the headset.  As an added benefit, stereo separation is dramatically improved so not only can I stop trying to read lips, I'm hearing way more detail in almost everything.  It even makes listening to streaming music better - great fidelity as you would expect from a Sennheiser product - definitely in the &#34;audiophile&#34; class in terms of quality.  I had originally ordered the next model up but when this model cam on sale, I've saved over a hundred bucks and I can't believe that any improvement that might possibly be found on the next model up would make any difference at all, at least for me.  As always, YMMV.  Independent control of the sound from the TV and that through the headphones makes everyone happy but for me at least, it's a whole new viewing (well, listening to what I'm viewing) experience.  Highly recommended to anyone that's looking for either a solution to partial hearing loss or in general, looking for higher quality audio than you would get from the TV's built in speakers or, for that matter, much better than the aftermarket sound bar/subwoofer setup I had purchased previously.  The drop on charger/stand makes it that much better, I just drop these in the hanger and in a few hours they're all charged up.  They do ship with an extra set of batteries but I changed those out for rechargeable a with a much higher capacity which equates to more than a whole day of use without the batteries running down.  Buy these, you won't regret it."
R3V43WXO767RXB,1,"Totally unacceptable.  There is a low frequency hum that is always present no matter where I place the transformer, loud enough to be heard at any volume and so distracting that you cannot tune it out.  Add this to the cheesy plastic that will wear quickly and the minimal padding in the ear cups and this is a complete fail."
R2FFH9HBWI30G8,2,Sound wasn't good enough!
R1P5IJMWWSULOM,4,"I’ve used these for about 2 months in the office at my computer. I alternate between using them on my laptop and my Galaxy SII and have the same experience with both. The sound is pretty good, nothing spectacular. They are pretty comfortable, although somewhat heavy/ bulky compared to my Koss PortaPros (obviously). I love the wireless feature. Very easy to hang up at the end of the day for overnight charge. Never had them fail after 9 hrs of straight listening. UPDATE: This occurs only while plugged into my computer, not on my phone- They do have FREQUENT little sounds- pops, fizzes, some random faint white noises that you don’t notice all the time during regular pop songs, but I listen to a lot of quiet music (classical) and you hear it a lot during the quiet parts. It’s not a deal breaker, but it is noticeable. I’ve learned to tune it out. I would still buy and use them because I think the convenience of wireless is a greater benefit (moving around my work space without worrying about a cord). One other negative is that when you’re starting the music up, it can take the transmitter some time to detect and start the transmission, between 3 – 20 seconds, about 5 seconds on average. If your computer/ phone is playing too quiet, you need to turn it up a little to get the transmitter to detect it (a little green light will show “on,” which is very helpful). The Basics: plug into wall. Male RCA jacks come out of a ~3’ cord which plug into the (supplied) Y-adapter male that takes you to a single 1/8” (3.5mm) to plug into your phone or computer output/ headphone jack. Lift the headset off the charging stand, flip the button to “on,” hit play on your device, wait 5 seconds, the transmitter will light up “on,” and you’ll hear your music/ movie. You can adjust the volume right on the headset. The first time, you’ll need to try out the 3 settings on the front of the transmitter that take you to different frequencies to see what works best. Youtune in on each of the settings with a small dial on the headphones like tuning a radio. You don’t need to remove/ look at the headphones to turn them on/off or adjust the volume or tuner/ frequency, so it’s pretty easy to use. Once it’s set, you won’t need to ever mess with the frequency. Basic day to day operation is just lift them off charger, put on head, turn on, and press play. When done, turn off and hang up."
R3VHS9JEBYB8M5,4,"I would give these a 5 star except they are just a bit too loose. If you are going to be moving around at all when you wear these, you might want to look elsewhere. I use them in my master bedroom so I don't wake the wife and they are perfect for that. They sound amazing. I can hear subtle background noises that I can't hear if using the TV speakers. Very cool. It's like a 5.1 surround on your ears!"
R1JUUARMZINYXZ,4,easy to dial in the channel and away you go into deep clear full sound without wires. you will have to use the rca style connectors and have a receptacle for power to the base. the headphones will adjust to a wide range. the range in my house fades out around 125 to 150 feet depending on what is in between. I would like to try a less bulky version.
R2WW1JLJDTMR2Q,4,"So far I like them, they have a clear sound. When I did get some static I just had to move the tuner and it took care of it. I've only had them a week but I think they will be very nice. The one thing I'm disappointed in is there is no light to show that they are on by the switch on the ear piece. If you forget to turn them off you will run your batteries down really quick. I had a pair from Radio Shack for $50 that had that light. I also don't like how the batteries are so close to your ear. They are covered by the cloth piece but I don't think it's enough. They are worth buying though for the clear sound."
R30VU7V5DDN6HP,4,Found it to be good in listening quality and adjustability.
R3ADFX6BBR4IUP,4,They sound good but because the ear pieces are flat they tend to slide off or your ears. I purchased the RS 170 instead<br />because the ear pieces cup around your ears so they don't side off of your ears.
R30NCLNLW6F5SK,4,An early Christmas present.  Have Directv with sound system.  Couldnt plug into stereo headphone jack without muting entire system. Couldnt plug into Tv because of HDMI input.  Plugged into Dtv receiver...walaa.  Good sound. Con is its touchy getting correct contact on base for charge.
RQNZOSZMJSYV9,2,"You must go on line to see how to hook it up.  From what I can tell, this wireless headphone does not work on our current TV.  Instructions are vague.  I would not recommend this item because of vague instructions."
RJC18HM4VHFCD,4,It is worth the money!
R3I31P49QXYOC1,5,"These are fantastic!!  They have perfect fidelity, and have clearly helped our marriage, since we can now each have our own volume!"
R2UYNASQDR5Y4B,5,"Here's the perfect solution for times when one person wants to watch TV while the other wants to read. Got a weekend sports fan in the family? He can watch as long as he wants without disturbing the rest of the family. Late-night TV can be watched without keeping others awake.<br />The base unit has three selectable channels so that any interference for other electronics can be eliminated. There is a small tuning control on the headset so that clear reception can be adjusted. The range is long, I can walk to our kitchen without losing the signal. The RF wireless reception means that you do not need to stay line-of-sight in front of your TV.<br />Great unit, highly recommended."
R1NEPRCYI1FBFL,4,"Theses headphones are very comfortable to wear. I have tried several other brands of wireless headphones before and always found there to be a lot of background interference. I read other reviews which bragged about how these showed no interference even when worn around a lot of other electronic equipment. Well I must take issue with that because even in my home I occasionally will hear some &#34;spritzs&#34; of interference. I find them to be the best I have tried to date and will be acceptable but are not totally interference free as some stated. That said, I think they are worth the money and may be as good as it gets."
R33F0YWHOZD4XC,5,"Very good TV headphones for the money (got them on a Christmas deal). I had a junk pair from the Sharper Image before, but these are 10 times better. I actually enjoy watching TV more with these on than without, as I pick up a lot of sounds I wouldn't hear otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, these are not studio quality headphones, but compared to built in TV speakers or junk you might buy for $30, these are very good. Great sound reproduction, decent bass and great stereo separation (music sounds very good!). I bought two sets, so I have to transmitters and two headphones, and changing a headphone to the other transmitter is a piece of cake. Just move the tuning wheel on the headphones to dial in the other transmitter. And the fact that they charge while on the base is really nice, and they turn off and on automatically with the TV (it senses the audio). Excellent range as well (I can roam around my house with no issues), and no static. Lastly, perfect audio timing, as there is no visible delay in the sound in my ears and the lip movement on the TV. Perfectly in sync. Very nice product.     The only criticism I have is the fit. And it's a pro and a con. They are not super snug on the head (I think I have an average sized head). They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time while sitting on the couch. But if you move around too much or tilt your head to far forward or backward, I find they will slide around a bit and sometimes fall off if I'm not careful. I wonder how they would do taking a 6 foot drop to a wood floor from the top of my head if I was walking around. Let's not find out. But again, since they aren't super tight, they are nice to wear as they don't cause discomfort. They're snug, just not tight like the claw feel of some cheaper stuff out there."
RBWEWU6M2XSO4,5,best seal I have made in  long time
R1V0ZZFSI4V7KH,5,"I can leave my mancave, walk to the other end of the house (60-70' away), and still hear whatever's on the TV/bluray.  Very comfortable.  Great value.  Use to have infa-red set.  You had to be inline with the inf-red &#34;signal&#34; for them to work.  These are radio frequency, works through walls!<br />Good sound.  Not Bose, but Bose doesn't make wireless headphones.  So for now, this is IMHO, the best available and the price is right"
RE1QX7HLB16V3,4,"Nice wireless headset. The value is there if you get it at sale, but at usual prices it can be a bit pricy for what you get. What you get is very simple - docking station w power cable and RCA audio cable (2 jack cable for audio - red\black), plus wireless headset (w rechargeable batteries inside).<br />I use this to watch TV when kids are sleeping or if I don't want to interrupt others in the living room. Headset is quite comfortable, although a bit heavy. Sound quality is excellent as is the range. Occasionally I'll be in another room - doing dishes for example, and listen to news or a show that's on TV - 0 interference, clear sound.<br /><br />Reason I took off one star - most new technology uses digital audio output. So you will need RCA audio output to use these. In my case, TV has RCA audio out and I can listen to TV with these, or to audio from any devices connected to TV via RCA or component cable (wii, old DVD, old VCR). But when i got a new blue ray player and connected to TV via HDMI, digital sound is not sent to RCA audio out, and I can't use the headset to listen to blu-ray or streaming services. Requires to buy an audio digital to analog converter which can be pricy."
R3LI5XGMLPP9QN,5,I bought this to help hear old movies and particularly old movies with British actors.  It really helps.  I haven't had it that long but so far so good.  Just last week I did find one sort of aggravating issue.  I had just installed a new &#34;smart&#34; tv (LG 55LB6100) and had no place to hook up input cables.  The cable tech tried to install through HDDVR but nothing worked.  Sennheiser customer service was easy to reach and had the solution.  I was instructed to buy a &#34;decoder&#34; and optical cable.  This should be easy to hook up (haven't got the parts at this writing) but the solution cost is about $60.00.  Perhaps a non-LG tv or different LG model might have more flexibility than mine.  I am not a audio-visual guy but the problem is that my DVD is hooked up to all available outputs.  Hope I got that right!
R29EMDZJM5X65V,5,"I've had my current set of headphones for about 9 years, and the on/off switch has developed a short in the circuit.  My sweet wife decided  replacement headphones would be a great Christmas present, and they were.  They came early, professionally packaged, as is always the case with Amazon; perform beautifully, and if anyone is looking for &#34;private viewing/listening&#34; to their favorite TV show, without disturbing even the person sitting next to you, you want the Sennheiser headphones.  You will be very pleased."
R3768ZA3A64EJG,2,One channel went out so only have sound in one ear
RUY4UQQYP2N3G,1,"Not at all what I expected from Sennheiser. I had tried my friends Sennheiser headphones which he paid a lot more for which were excellent. The RS 120's which I now understand are discontinued  are their low end economy model and do not even come close to my old Sony MDR-RF970OR, or even older MDR-RF92R wireless headphones. Unlike the Sonys that have a choice of three different operating frequencies which are independently selected and lock in on the sending unit and headphones, The Sennheisers' have a 3 position switch on the sending unit but a tuneing wheel on the headphones which does not allow for precise frequency selection which results in annoying unacceptable hiss, distortion, and transmission interruption."
RH0KMH4MZNZF7,5,"Very nice. Great sound. They function beautifully anywhere in the house, and in the yard.<br />Just what we were looking for."
RNALLX2WHG2N0,4,Replaced the same model that had broken right in the middle.
R374EW0SPYI7IZ,5,Ideal so far. No problems...
R1G4OVBOQRTBHL,5,Gave these to my SO for a birthday gift. He really likes them. Setup was simple. The primary use is for his &#34;gaming&#34; TV. I like the they have an on/off switch and volume button right on the headset. I'm not thrilled with the load static when they time out but it certainly gets your attention when its been set off to the side lol.
R12RQVHPM810F2,3,Very good product. The only thing I don't like is when you use it for a while the head set turning warm and I get headache I don't know why may be head set too tight or head set turns hot
R2H55V4CZ1ER0F,3,"Best of the wireless I've tried, but still uncomfortable, too tight over ears. Getting some static. Don't like having to adjust volume on headphones, much easier to use wired headphones and adjust volume on receiver. The wire is a pain, but still better than the tradeoffs for wireless."
RMYCXM924GR05,5,"If you or someone else in your home watches noisy sports games like football while you'd like not to be distracted by the noises of the game if you're reading or talking, etc., buy this for the TV sports watcher. He or she can enjoy the game while you do on with YOUR life."
R2XWVNDY2BXY0E,5,"If you can't stand listening to sports at top volume, get these for the person who does. Excellent, excellent quality. And the sound is also great. My husband wears these all the time and I can read without losing my mind. Save your marriage/relationship, buy these headphones. Also good for in the bedroom when one person wants to sleep and the other wants to watch sports at top volume."
R144D0N5UXLPVG,4,Have been using these headphones for about 6 months and quite satisfied with the quality of sound.  Would have preferred a more comfortable over the ear headphone which blocked the sound from those around me.
R2L0DYDPOODJ0R,3,"The only thing I can say bad about this item is, if you bend forward just a little it will slip off your head. Other than that it is a great headphone, once the batteries are charged you can use it without recharging it for over 18 hours. I would recommend these if you are in the market for wireless headphones."
R13ZKXKO0TCK2P,3,"These worked good, but they are too big on my head."
R1KCNXNESZ3YJE,5,"Love these. Just remember to charge them, but sound great."
RX18ATMX6DY0Z,5,Buy an extra set of headphones and preserve your marriage.
R18WVDAYMDQZ0W,1,The headphones themselves were ok but I did not like the way the headphone felt on the ear.  Very uncomfortable.  My prior version(higher priced) of this brand were over the ear type and much better.  I would recommend their over the ear headphones over the on the ear type.  They are fabulous headphones for watching TV.  I must say the way Amazon handled the return was fabulous.  I was very impressed.
R24F2U9ZVIN3ZY,4,Good product would do business again.
R17J4EMB6MQH5O,5,Works well; turning head will result in a bit of static.
R2D2QHWC612BNP,5,These improved my quality of life.  I can hear the television perfectly when I am in the kitchen cooking without having to turn the volume way up.  I also use them on the couch and don't need to put closed captions on anymore because the sound with these is so sharp and clear.  I am very happy with them.  I did not experience any of the issues that are in some of the other reviews.
RM4CQX4AUHHH7,4,"I have had this since 2007/8 and it works very well.  The first set had some problems and Sennheiser replaced the entire unit without any problem.  Second set has worked very well.  Sound quality is very good without any hissing noise.  Sound (voices and music) is better (easier to distinguish) than that from the TV itself.  In fact, I set the volume on the headphones to a lower level than what I would on the TV if I was not using the headphones.  I use it daily for at least three hours, often six or more.  I've replaced batteries once.  For those who have problems getting the headphones to recharge, just make sure the red charging light on the charging station lights up when placing the headphones on it.  Some complain that the charging station LED won't light up.  This is probably due to the headphone not being placed correctly on the charger. It is easy to set the headphones on the charger in the correct location to start charging.  It is very  important to note that the charger/transmitter won't send a signal to the headphones if the incoming volume to the charger/transmitter from the TV, etc., is not high enough for the unit to recognize/accept it.  I had the same situation until I increased the volume on my TV so the yellowish/white LED light came on.  This is the bottom light on the charger that is labeled Surround Sound Input Level. Set the TV volume high enough for the LED light to stay lighted without it flickering.  Of course, I mute the TV volume and then adjust the volume on my head set to that desired.  In my case, if I didn't mute the TV volume it would be too loud for anyone else to enjoy.  The top light on the charger is the on/off LED light.  It shows a green light when you turn on the headphones.  Yes, if the TV goes silent for over a couple of minutes there will either be no sound or some static.  Static is not very loud if one has not been listening to a program with overly high volume on the headphones.  Remember, this is an RF ear phone unit.If radio frequency is lost, something must be done to reacquire it.  Wired headphones don't have this problem.  When the TV sound resumes, my headset beeps a couple of times and resumes good quality sound.  Read the instructions for what each set of beeps mean.  On very rare occasions (unknown what causes this), what I call a reset might be needed.  For instance, no sound at all - just unplug charger, remove batteries from headphones for several minutes (15 to 30) and then plug charger back in to power and replace batteries.  Sound returns.  This is some type of reset according to Sennheiser.  Also, if the signal is not coming in clear, one can press the button above the on-off button on the headset for several seconds to reset signal reception and the sound returns.  Yes, the head set can be somewhat loose.  If it was tighter, it would be unbearable to wear and hurt the ears, especially it you wear glasses as I do.  This set basically rests on the top of the head and not tight on the ears.  The ear pad foam has never deteriorated.  It is somewhat dirty but is still very useful.  I will replace the pads at some future time.  My ear pad does cover my ear and keeps out quite a bit of outside noise.  I can however, hear my wife talk to me as needed.  The set is not made to prevent all outside sounds from being heard.  As long as this set works well, I won't replace it."
R2OZO40W1MXM15,5,I've been using these headphones for several months now and they are really great.
R2ABLE4JTLYJ35,4,Works as advertised.  Easy to install.  Wish the quality was a bit better for the price.
R348LIH6VIY7WR,5,"Fantastic. My wife will claim these saved our marriage... I think thats a bit dramatic, but it keeps her from having to listen to the race all afternoon on Sundays. I can work in the kitchen, go upstairs, I can even take the dog for a short walk down behind the house, and not miss listening to whatever I'm watching on TV. The range is great. They are very comfortable too."
RJL96RIDIG5IS,5,"this has been a game changer for me in the past I have had to go into my small bedroom and watch my small tv  now I get to stay in living room and watch television on the larger screen and not disturb my sick husband whose b/r wall is on the other side .<br /><br />so needless to say this has made me considerably happier , also I plan on moving my small tv out of my b/r to the kitchen as I don't like a magnetic field in my bedroom and I will use the headphones in the am also<br />thank you  this has taken me out of the closet so to speak ! should have done this a long time ago love love tove this !"
R1CKNE909KFESX,5,Works great even when in another room.  The tv I bought does not have the necessary ports but I turned on another tv in another room and used it.  Only problem is when wife decides to change the station and I can here the voices from the other tv in the other room as I iam watching her surf the stations.lol
R2H9JJNYNL3CDP,5,used it for 1 week. Zero effort to setup and working as expected.  Great sound quality.
RIMV3TLJVIBF,1,"Dead on arrival. It had a very low volume sound first and after full charge of batteries it produced nothing but noise. Change of channels, location did not help. Sent it back. Waste of my time"
R1IBFOWIZ88K79,1,One day into use I started getting background static.  It then went to complete static without being able to get any sound despite trying to tune the earphone.  The ear pads are uncomfortable.  It is not up to the standards of my other sennheiser products of which I have a wired and a wireless model for my computers. This lower level earphone is not worth the money.  I now see why it was a featured discounted item for Christmas.  I cannot return the item since after trying to get to work for about an hour it ended up against the TV room wall.
R222HTA8ENF2C2,5,Works Great ... use for late night TV viewing ... easy set up ... sometimes at the initiation of a listening session it loses connection to the TV (in spite of being always plugged into TV and always charging) - just turn TV off & on and connection is reestablished and no problems ...
R3EJDYCGDQ5OMX,1,"I bought this after I junked the third set of TV Ears. They came highly recommended, you know that Sennheiser is quality I was told. For the 39 days that these things actually worked, I can certainly understand why it receives such rave reviews. They worked well. However, now that only the left side works and the right side is mostly static. I understand the negative reviews as well.  I sent email to technical support and received no response which tells me that once they have your money they simply don’t care about support. A Progresso soup can and string would work better. Don’t waste your money. Come the weekend I’m going to a real audio shop and get professional advice regardless of the time, and cost involved."
R3SPI81LE48JL7,5,"Love this, as it frees me to listen to TV or Music while everyone is sleep. Works and sounds great."
R2TU3O5J011GW9,5,"As described, works in computer as described"
R3SWN9XJTBLLXG,2,"I got these because I wanted wireless headphones but didn't want to rely on Bluetooth.  I was wary of the loss of audio quality with Bluetooth, and for my office audio setup I have multiple sources going into a receiver, which does not stream Bluetooth.  Even though I never sit more than a few feet away from the transmitter/charging station I always hear a noticeable hiss when I have the headphones on, and as I move around I'll get little bursts of louder hiss.  I suspect this is caused by some electronic interference from all the other electronics in my office, or perhaps from another radio frequency user located nearby.  Switching channels does not mitigate this issue.  Hiss not withstanding, the sound is pretty good and has a nice dynamic range.  The biggest issue, which is a deal-breaker for me, is that if you pause your audio source for more than three minutes or so the headphones will suddenly erupt in static noise, which can be quite startling.  In the user manual this seems to be described as a feature: &#34;If the headphone output volume is set too low, the transmitter automatically switches off&#34;.  This would be okay if it meant the headphones went silent.  I often need to pause my music playback momentarily, and I work with sparse audio sources on my computers, so this is a constant issue.  I have to remember to turn the headphones off before I let them go silent for too long.  I can't imagine how this design flaw made it through Sennheiser's quality control.  If these headphones had not been a gift, I would have returned them.  For now I'm looking into Bluetooth transmitters for my receiver, and hoping that someone will invent Apple Airplay-enabled headphones...<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Good build quality<br />Comfortable<br />Charging station is convenient and functional<br />Good sound compared to Bluetooth<br /><br />Con's:<br />Easily affected by radio interference, often resulting in noticeable hiss<br />Extremely loud static noise when audio source goes silent for too long."
R2CVO9H83WRG5C,5,You Bet
R1TXXR8DEDFKSK,5,"Worked right out of box !<br />Rechargeable batteries were appreciated. Also 2 different sizes of plugs.<br />Great, prompt service !"
RGUMZDKFHJT4G,3,Sent back to Sennheiser for adjustment. Fine now.
R36N0Y5HFXF8DR,4,I really like the quality of the sound for the money. The charger rack is a great design element. The only thing is they are not compatible with digital sound connections (most new TV's have) you have to purchase a separate digital to analog converter and cables at an additional cost.
R3FI4ZQ0CC89ZG,5,"This is my third pair of Sennheiser HPs, already having a pair of HD 280 and HD 598 phones for use as studio monitors and for music listening, respectively.    I play electric guitar, and often do blues improv along with backing tracks. I like to jam fairly loud sometimes, and when wailing away during the early AM quiet hours, I sometimes use headphones instead of a guitar amp, but I hate the additional cord. I decided that I needed a pair of wireless analog headphones, so when I saw these on a daily deal at Amazon for just 60 bucks, I jumped. I wanted open design HPs, so I could hear the phone and such annoyances.    Why analog? Because every wireless digital pair I've tried had a small (but noticeable) amount of latency between when I picked a string and when I heard it coming out of the headphones. That doesn't matter if you're listening to recorded music, but when you're playing the music yourself, it's extremely annoying, and if you play, you'll understand. Sure, you can just use wired phones, but I wanted one less cord if I could do it. These RS 120 phones cut the cord and also had as little latency as I could realistically expect.    Pros:    1. No latency! Awesome for playing guitar.  2. Headset uses a pair of AAA NiMH rechargeables, not some proprietary battery  3. Charges while hanging on the base, no charger cord connection needed  4. Light, cool, and comfortable    Cons:    1. A tiny amount of analog hiss at high volumes, but only audible during very quiet passages, irrelevant for my application, just FYI, and expected with analog wireless HPs  2. Has a permanently attached cord with RCA connectors, would prefer RCA jacks mounted on the base  3. Short power cord    All in all, and for the price, I have no complaints. I will say that my first unit was defective, and I couldn't get both channels to play cleanly, but the replacement was perfect, and Amazon got them to my door before they even got back my return!"
R18LVEOE2VD25O,5,Works great.  We are very much enjoying
R3CDA9JEZD86B6,3,"I have no problem with the sound quality of these, but they are not ideal for my intended use of them, which is to use on my computer, which I have hooked up to a big screen tv, and sit a distance away from. I had used some wired Sennheiser headphones before and was constantly tripping over the wire when I got up. These don't have that problem, but they do time out after a while to preserve the battery is guess, and then I hear static instead of nothing. Since I am not constantly listening to sound from the computer, this gets to be a constant problem, so I have to keep switching them on and off, so not only is this a hassle, but the switch will eventually get worn out."
RFRDF2TQIB37R,4,Not as satisfied as with the older nonchargeable one I owned. Get some fuzziness as I tilt my head sometimes.
R2H85OIHZ0CSZN,5,"I had 12 year old pair of Sennheiser  Wireless RS 45 headphones that worked great until about 6 months ago. They began to go snap-crackle-pop and I had to play with the volume on my home theater to the sound correct. On Saturday, they just stopped working. I ordered the RS 120 wireless headphones on Saturday and got them Monday---way to go Amazon!. I just installed them, which took all of about 5 minutes, and I cannot believe the sound! It is as though I have a new pair of ears! The bass is deep and rich, the highs crystal clear and I heard things on a movie I have watch a dozen times (Apollo 13 in Blu-Ray) that I never heard before!<br />I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs a wireless, NON-BLUETOOTH, set up for an older home theater, or any other set-up that does not have Bluetooth."
R1PHVMM9Y0SUCL,5,"I was originally very dissapointed, but when I replaced One of the rechargable batteries with a fresh one, it has worked very fine! Glad that I bought them. There is a lot of volume and a long last to the charge of the batteries."
R3JJ65C355E928,5,"These headphones are great. I bought some for my father. Easy set up, clear sound. Work perfectly."
R3RJV5DAOW5P5,4,"My sole purpose was to utilize this product with my TV and it did not disappoint, it worked immediately after being plugged in and I am very pleased with the quality and functionality.<br /><br />On the ideal product, I'd prefer a smaller transmitter that could be hidden from view, particularly when you have a TV that's mounted on a wall. Also, I'd prefer the charger to be built into the headset and not the transmitter.<br /><br />A few minor issues to note: 1) the charger light stays on even when the headset is fully charged. I'm told that most batteries lose life if they remain on the charger after they are fully charged, but that's not referenced on the manual anywhere. I'm hoping that the damage will be minimal in the long run 2) there's a hissing sound (similar to the sound of a static channel) after a brief gap when there's no actual sound on the TV or what was being played has finished or stopped."
R11B63EE6T2MLU,5,"Have had these for a couple of years now. Still use them. Never had any problems with them. While wearing them I can leave the room and still hear the tv. Pretty cool, I can go to the kitchen and not miss anything!"
RUTUXWTGAAAR,5,I used TV Ears for 6 month but the ear buds hurt as the headset was like a vice. I replaced them with Sennheiser rS120s and oh my....what a difference in sound and comfort!
R707AQCPS1TPU,5,"As an insomniac, this is the best thing I can recommend to preserve a relationship.  These puppies are lite, the quality of sound is superb, and the easiness to install is dummy proof!!!"
R3M0QHJR0HOW3A,5,these things are great! love um!
R13LJGAGJLSURW,4,"One of the best wireless headsets that I have owned in recent times. Its reception is very clear, simple installation and tuning, long range. The only cons is it feels bit flat and stiff when placed the year."
R28U315RLQRLMQ,5,"I just had to try out my Christmas present before Christmas.  And I'm glad I did.  These Sennheiser RS120s are great!  Holds the signal well, without the loss and recapture typically associated with 823-920MhZ phones.  Doesn't  interfere with my router and wifi!  Clear tones with great separation.  Super easy charging rack.  Comfortable ear pads.  Most background hiss between recordings is greatly diminished.  I'm listening to reel to reel I recorded over 50 years ago and CDs.  Both are sounding great!  Great signal strength too.  I can't imagine the performance from their $200 upscale units.  For the average audiophile, these are top notch.  Asked my wife to just wrap the empty box to put under the tree.  I want to listen to my old recordings."
RFH4Q312USR72,5,"I like these though others have issues I guess where the controls are. I find them to be quite easy. Once they are set they don't seem to be needed again. I use this for music and use the volume control on my amp rather than the headset and once set seems to work out fine. Also some complain of these shutting off when sounds are very low or non existent for a short period of time. Hasn't happened once to me. Again I only use it for music which I listen too, which there is no time of prolong silence or low volume. Perhaps with dialogue for movies or TV it could happen."
RVLJC4HES9S4F,5,Very pleased with the product!
R1NDBT4X4FMHL2,5,I love this!!!! Now my fiancé can play as much as he wants and I can listen to my music we both win!!!!
R2FVFPZZQQC8U8,5,This headphone is great I can go from my family room to my living room and still have great sound.
RN44IART35OSZ,4,We are still trying it out.  The sound isn't perfect
RUFELZF3Z3G29,3,Good sound but loose on my head with no way to size to stay on better. Had to use strap to stablize on my head.
RGTTKM01KEZ8Y,3,"I bought this based on the ratings, but was disappointed when I received it.  The headphones has a hiss that is somewhat distracting.  It is louder than the JVC pair that I have, that was being replaced by this purchase.  The hiss is noticeable enough to distract from what I was watching.  I was only about 5 feet from the base.  Also, the On-Ear would be comfortable for maybe an hour, but after that I think the Over-Ear would be needed for longer listening.  I unfortunately returned my pair.  I'll probably have to spend a bit more to get the quality I am looking for."
R3JHH6425CD1NS,3,"Loves the product when it works.  This is the 3 unit I bought in 3 years.  The headphone is comfortable and voice reproduction accurate.  However, the transmitter burns off every year.  It appears to be a common problem as I learned online.  No, common 900 Hz transmitter doe not work as this is 926... Frustrating but I like the headphones hence the 3rd purchase... (You can buy Sennheiser transmitter dirrect from factory - foor more than the whole unit on sale..."
R33CKG7DL3ZZJS,3,"Quality is good, but I have a smallish head and find that the headphones are very large for me."
RL1SRM4KN2BEU,5,My fussy husband loves these!!!!!
R7M4IDNA7MSX3,4,He wishes he'd ordered the one with the more padded earphones.
R2SCPCUKLLTNFR,1,Crappy product.  I dropped it on the couch about a week after I got it and it stopped working altogether.  I'm glad Amazon has a good return policy.
R3GZYN4QQVDTOS,1,"Sound was pretty good, but there was a low level rhythmic buzzing in the background.  Changing the channel did not help.  The buzz was the same level at 2 feet and 50 feet.  Tried turning on and off all the fluorescent lights and appliances in the house and could not eliminate the buzz.  Returned to Amazon.  Also, if the transmitter loses power or you get out of range, you get a loud blast of HISS!!!!"
RX03YXXYH4G6H,5,Once I figured out the correct plugs on the TV the headphones work great
RGXEQ6PWU5BBM,5,"I bought this to replace the TvEar I had and found that this Sennheiser is a much better product. Not only is it sturdier but it also has a excellent sound quality. Another good point of this product is that when you wearing it walk around in the room, or even to other rooms you still hear from the tv without losing any sound quality. I strongly recommend this product."
R3U6VERB1K2Y5Z,4,Works as advertised
R2LM4D234AGHIG,5,"Be able to hear everything while watching TV! The TV can be on mute so as not to disturb any one else and you are able to hear perfectly. This is my second Sennheiser RS120, and I've just purchased one for my 90 year old mother, who is now able to watch TV and HEAR ALL. You are able to hear everything, including someone hiding in the bushes and all the background sounds. My first Sennheiser was absolutely wonderful. The problem being, I received a very informative guide booklet to be able to adjust everything I needed to do if there was a problem., I could look up different issues and fix them myself very easily. I lost the guide book, and no one from the company answered my request, nor did they send me another guide book. With these TWO orders, neither one had a guide book enclosed. Only directions on how to attach it to the TV. The support was not available. I do not know what to do about it, but in the meantime I am enjoying, once again, watching TV and not having to have my TV on extra loud. It makes my husband very happy - me, too."
R1NG0SOO9D9LFJ,5,"Exceptional performance and versatile. My wife uses it more than I do. She really likes the product because she gets a better quality sound from it. Also, I really it a lot because when my wife watches TV I can enjoy reading in the same room with her w/o the loud annoying sound from the TV."
R2ECQHKFH5OG4Y,5,Works great!!!
R3N14HEW1K2LW0,1,"I got limited use from these headphones.  Received them mid-summer 2014.  Disconnected them October 2014 due to poor reception, and/or static, and/or just no sound.  Only one adult in household so they were not abused.  Also watch approximately 3 hours TV at night.  They were fine initially.  Very disappointed."
R2SCST9OBB90MG,5,Very good headphones. Exceeded expectations.
RHMVJ47U68CYA,5,"Just bought 2 new ones after having two which lasted years. They're virtually indestructible and have excellent range. Dropped mine off my roof, went down and got them and they were still tuned to my music."
R2ACBLGGYJOXO1,4,There is a hiss which you can hear on silent scenes but it does not bother me much.<br />Anyway sound from this headphones is much better then from my TV.<br /><br />I also bought this:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M4IWNQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_16<br />to be able to connect it to TV.
R19Q5U0LOHJ5VK,5,best wireless headsets around for the price! very comfortable on your head and sound is great I think. a great buy.
R1VKWRQVH9BY1J,2,"Good value. Ultimately returned for the open RS 180 (200% better) due to static noise and comfort issue.  For the price there is nothing better, however, I didn't like the ear pads one bit (not enough foam).  Tuning the RS 120 is something I really didn't like, it's outdated technology in times of Bluetooth and digital transmission...  Good: Base station turns on automatically and the charging cradle is a good solution as well.  Again for the price they are good, only there are much better solutions (RS 170/ RS 180 with 2.4GHz Kleer digital technology)  available. More money but worth it.   I would not recommend these, 10 years ago I probably would have.  Do yourself a favour and buy a set without the need for tuning."
RV64J6L2JQS62,5,Handy and user friendly...  no wires... good sound...  fair range... about 100 feet..
RYJ1O51N9ZS55,5,I have this as an accessory for one of my TV's and highly recommend it.  No swapping batteries in the middle of a ball game or any other malfeasance.  You can watch a whole Sunday on one charge (if your wife lets you).  Good value for the money.  Highly recommend.
R13UPDQQKPED7C,5,"So far, no problems, works as expected with no interfearance or drop out in 1400 sqft, room to room.  Good audio.  Drums are a bit intrusive to lay down on your side and are sloped with the rear or back of the ear area being thicker/higher. A breeze to setup/hook up and very good play/run time between charging.  Nothing fancy, easy to operate."
R14SF5MZX6NDZN,3,Will not stay on and considerable sound leakage.
R2WE9VV79LD2LR,4,"Very easy installation.  Works exactly as claimed, comfortable fit, decent sound.  No hum or buzz as others wrote"
R3MNIR6FIC89A6,5,Headphones are great! No problem setting them up and tuning. A great bargain :)
R2J73GJYHBTKYQ,3,I was disappointed when I started to sue the headphones at work.  While there are three channels there seems to be some interferance of and on on all of them.  Between songs there is always some type of static no matter the settings I try.<br /><br />The head phones also slide off my head on a regular basis when I don't have issues with other large pairs.<br /><br />Overall I am glad I got this on a huge sell otherwise I would never by them.
RCBGNR6ED2Y3C,3,"Not as good as radio shack brand. Not as clear, when you fine tune it is very sensitive with volume control on ears. Tight on ears for large me."
R7NAE8USDGPJZ,1,Can't get it to function instructions very vague
R2QFRAZPIIFY0T,5,"Love them, my husband wears at night while I hit the pillow and it is perfect.  He said quality of sound is excellent.  Both of us are happy :-)"
R3R2AUQR4K3MDZ,5,IMHO Sennheiser is the best headphones for listening to TV. These work great.
R245491ZC5FTBO,5,Still works wonderfully after almost 2 years. A must have for that price.
R32G3OS2XGD0DV,5,"Knew I was experiencing some hearing loss and when I noticed my wife turning down the TV when I left the room, decided it was time to do something.  The RS120 was an excellent choice. Great sound, easy to use.  Decided on this product, because I have used Sennheiser microphones, sound mixers and amps with excellent results.  Only negative is the poor instructions regarding  battery installation.  Will probably buy another unit."
R13GI75VHDXUBD,4,"So far, so good.  Sound is great and is easy to install."
REMALF9Z5SQKZ,5,My wife has 2 of these and just loves them and they work great.
R161FYI7KSS1SF,3,"Would not buy again. Persistent buzz during quiet moments. Also get static every so often out of no where and it's only 2 feet away from the cradle. Sounds good when it is working properly, but the persistent buzz gets pretty annoying. I've tried several suggested fixes. Put computer output sound to max while dialing down the headphone's volume. Tried all fine tuning to all 3 different channels. Just not a great wireless system. Definitely not worth such a hefty price, but I got it on holiday sale but still don't feel great about the purchase. May return."
R2TGJ1RG4LNNIC,2,A lot of static despite the good reviews people have posted. It's pretty sensitive and it's quite annoying. I'll be gaming or talking on Skype and out of no where it will randomly make sporadic loud static noises that make you want to throw it off.
R20OVGYNUFQAEB,5,"A great buy, sound and controls wonderful."
R23YBYOGP3OAO4,5,"Very smooth, large sound. These are my first RF wireless headphones - goes way beyond my expectations."
R384MUD6O6S9F3,3,I love My headphones. Can't tell you how much. Don't need my hearing aids to watch television and the clarity is wonderful.
R1X1QBFGSDSQDM,3,"This is a great headset but however the transmitter is a huge annoyance, i wanted this to connect to my phone which it can but i cant go very far without carrying this gigantic transmitter."
R3OBEUTVFFWT9C,5,"Excellent, exactly what I needed and wanted..."
R2NE0SMU1CIHFX,5,"GREAT PRODUCT, IT WORKS WITH GREAT SOUND."
R1EMI662NVWM1W,2,On -ears kept sliding off.  More sound in left ear than from right.  Almost impossible to adjust sound.
R2AUA8M5JKF2U6,5,great sounds and you can play it as loud as you want without listening to her.......................................
ROJHZVS1YEAHM,5,MIL thinks this is the best thing ever invented and we don't have to go deaf listening to the television anymore!
R1CXRL6I2PYFB6,3,quit working after 6 months
REP1W3E9SXWP4,5,"Set up these headphones yesterday.  Great quality sound, comfortable on the head and looks stylish.  Very happy with the product."
R1F7IEMJJ2O04C,1,"The Transmitter did not turn on!!! The on-off LED strangely did not turn on (charging LED Worked, so I know I connected the power adapter correctly). This is my first warehouse used product! The quality control obviously sucks, Amazon obviously will refund the price, but I almost feel like I need to be compensated for the 30-60 mins I spent troubleshooting!!!"
RSRWKV7J7JLCE,5,I purchased these a year ago for my nearly deaf parent. They have worked flawlessly and have made a world of difference and enabled him to enjoy TV!
R1VM5C8WA0775Q,5,I can sleep while my man watches tv now :)
R7YQIUMPAM168,3,"Three major flaws that make these difficult to use in say bed next to your partner:<br />1. Open construction means person next to you hears everything, very clearly unless the sound is turned way down.<br />2. The construction is astonishingly cheap for Sennheiser. These creak and groan with every adjustment as the plastic shifts around.<br />3. The ear pad material is very slippery, these tend to slide off if your head is at an angle..<br /><br />That being said, they sound good...I just don't think they are well designed for their intended use."
R1AA0EA7VS0O8B,5,They are good
RUDAMYFXEEN6W,5,"These headphones are great.  I plug them into the headphone jack on the back of my tv which still allows anyone else watching to hear the sound.  They have a stand that charges the headphones when not in use.  Very clear sound.  I normally need to have the TV volume set high in order to hear clearly.  With these headphones, we can keep the volume low and I can hear quite well."
R3AAWDWSH6Q1UL,3,"As I stated in my review below, I was having trouble with a scratchy volume control and hiss and reception dropouts.     I fixed the problems by doing two things.    1. I sprayed electronic contact cleaner into the volume control and worked the knob until the corrosion was gone: scratchy volume control problem solved.    2. I replaced the included AAA rechargeable 800mAh batteries with new 1000mAh rechargeable batteries: hiss and reception problems solved.     Original review:    \\""I have owned a set of these for years. I use them with the TV in the bedroom so I don't disturb my wife. And as much as I like my other Sennheiser cans, including the HD600, HD202, P250, and P100 models, these RS120s are just poor. I wanted to like them. I really did. So, here's the thing. Even within 10 ft of the receiver the reception is spotty at best with annoying hiss and dropouts any time I move my head. But that's not the worst of it. The volume pot has apparently rusted causing all sorts of static and imbalance whenever I adjust it. Once I get a clean setting dialed in, which takes awhile, I just pray I don't inadvertently knock the wheel. My advice? Take the money you would spend on these and buy a later model higher up the food chain line like the RS170s or RS180s.\\"""
R15Q9CNW3SEOFU,5,Best wireless headphones we have ever owned
R19KIR2IDPYPWL,5,The clarity is outstanding!!!  Very east to set up.  Comfortable on the ears.
RHSKKJCC7FU4O,4,"Bought this in 2008.  Outdated, but it still works, and I still use it."
R10YKC0SSS1WM9,5,Great product!!!
R3Q3HNG2VOLF3K,4,"I bought these headphones elsewhere, so I won't show up as a verified buyer from Amazon. However, I can absolutely attest to the durability and quality of these headphones. The KEY thing to recognize is that you will need charger source to headphones sight ability for them to work best. In other words, hang the charger up on the wall so that wherever you're sitting you'll see the charger. If it's in another room or out of sight, they won't work well. Otherwise, there are no real flaws in these headphones, and I have owned them for over four years. Great quality for a very good product--definitely worth buying at around $55 on sale as they are for the Gold Box Deal. You can probably find them cheaper elsewhere AFTER the Gold Box Deal has expired."
R10JJMG69A9NOW,4,Amazing works just as described. We have used others before and the price was perfect for these it is clear all over the home and the tuning function is a snap which has been a drag with other wireless headphones.
R1UEBUAL9YQF88,5,"Been using for over a week, I'm no audiophile but they're great for what I need, wireless ability to listen quietly to my TV. contrary to some reviewers the hiss is only present if you do not tune the headphones correctly, also these people don't understand how to properly tune.<br />First, connect headphones.<br />turn the headset volume all the way down and turn your source volume up to a medium loud volume, you don't want to magnify a weak source volume because this willresult  in distortion.<br />Now pause your source if possible, use a dvd if need be.<br />Next with the source paused there should be no sound right? slowly turn up your headset volume a bit at a time, the source should still be paused so you shouldn't hear anything. If you hear a hiss then keep tuning until it goes away. There you go.<br />Works like a champ if you know how to use it!"
REMPHM5H4SNJV,3,These headphones sound great when they aren't hissing at you.  The more I used them the more I get annoyed by the random hissing and static that comes through the RF.  If you use these headphones for loud movies or games it will probably be less noticeable.
RHCQQLQQDRFMQ,4,"I'm very pleased with the Sennheiser headphones. The quality is good, the sound is excellent and it was a breeze to hook up to my tv."
R3QMUUQ82IMT2N,5,Great product for the money and it works well for the hearing impaired......
R350AC5QAGJLBL,5,"We bought our first pair about 10 years ago when our kids were little. My husband has a moderate hearing loss and these have been perfect for him to fully enjoy watching tv without me having to repeat information or needing to turn up the volume. We have never had any problems and loved the one set so much that we bought an additional pair for me a few years later. They have also been great as the kids have grown and the adults like to enjoy movies or shows that we don't want them to overhear, due to violence or language (though our pause button is well worn!). That goes the other way too: we don't have to hear those annoying cartoons, either! They're also great when someone is using the tv in our loft, which has no walls to contain sound, so there is no competing for volume. We can use them with or without the tv sound on, depending on who's watching tv. Having said all that, notice that we purchased our first pair about 10 years ago. They still work. Same battery, countless falls to the floor. One of the best entertainment purchases we ever made."
R2DKFI0NQQ4GLZ,5,Excellent wireless headphone and very light. Getting it for my own usage.<br /><br />Will be getting the following better model for my brother's Christmas gift<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBPJCO?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B000EBPJCO&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=3T4FL2RG6NOXKW4I<br /><br />Cheers!
R3JRAFRSG35ZTX,5,"i have had these and an extra set of headphones for this transmitter, i used them with my two sony bravia tv's THEY ARE AWESOME ,if you don't like using rechargeable battery feature you can use two AAA alkaline batteries instead for head sets themselves but still have to plug base/transmitter to home power outlet"
RO857YR43C07A,5,"I purchased these for my 93-year-old father in a nursing home.  He is nearly deaf even with a hearing aid.  The only way he was able to watch TV in the nursing home is with the sound turned down and closed-captioning turned on.  But with these, he can finally hear the TV again.  We had to purchase a digital to analog converter so it would work with his TV which only had digital optical output.  The sound on the TV itself can be turned all the way down so as not to bother the other residents.  The only drawback is the rechargeable batteries.  Since he is bedridden, he has to remember to give the headphones to a nurse to put on the charging dock.  However, since the batteries are replaceable, I always remember to bring an extra set of charged batteries when I visit.  I was even thinking of getting a set for our home.  The sound quality on the headphones is very good; in fact, they are better than the speakers on our TV."
R34ZTZC0HMRXRA,2,"Headphones are comfortable, but we still get some static when listening to programs.  Not sure if it's the headphones or Samsung TV. If static goes away, we'd give them a 5."
RIFYPHB06RJSC,5,"Sennheiser makes the best headphones bar non. The sound quality is excellent. Sounds like sorround sound. Deminimus (less than minimal, almost to little to even mention) interference. Range is outstanding. My daughter uses them on her desktop and can walk around anywhere in the apartment and not loose sound. She has gone to the laundry room (1 floor down and about 50 feet away) and not lost sound quality. The charging is quick and easy. Just place them in the stand when not in use and you have hours of use time. If only Sennheiser make a wireless headset with microphone. They'ed rule the world."
R24V0HHLDSNDDZ,1,Disappointingly noisy.  Less than advertised range for good reception.  2 out of 3 of the FM bands are unusable.
R826YT1BC2PRE,5,I love thrm
R3PNYGOJIO6RWP,4,"Some what static even at 10 feet away, but still has good sound."
R28XZQ4SY06CMU,5,"I got these for my Grandpa, who is very hard of hearing, and he absolutely loves them!<br />He used to have a very hard time hearing the TV, but now that's no longer the case.<br />These are technically over-the-ear headphones, but they're quite comfy, despite their simple cushioning design. The cushion is basically just a thin layer of foam, with a soft, wool-like black cloth over them, which allows for continuous use for extended periods of time.<br />These are definitely not for audiophiles, especially as the reception, audio quality, and volume modulation can get a bit shoddy, depending on the unit you're attaching it to (in my grandpa's case, the TV), but for his modest use the quality is more than satisfactory.<br />Considering that my grandfather is not at all technically inclined, the controls and usage are simple, and he has absolutely no trouble with re-tuning, charging, or adjusting the volume."
R3NQDFC0JVIZQU,5,"EXCELLENT SOUND, IF YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING YOUR TV THESE HEADPHONES ARE THE ANSWER!  I bought these for my father who struggles hearing the TV.  EASY SET UP! Rechargeable batteries, just put them on the cradle and turn off the headphones.<br />He doesn't use them for music so I can't comment on that. Awesome sound and clarity!"
R3LRT1YQUCU9YC,3,"I just could not figure out how to make it work on my TV, DVD and cable box. The old headphone I had, I could move from one unit to the other and this one was to difficult. Guess there is another way of hooping it up but I'm to old to figure all this out."
R1LX7E9PO4OC63,5,These are really good headphones.  I can wear them as I make dinner and wander around the house doing things and the sound is clear and comfortable.  The charge lasts for ages and the ear pieces are very comfortable.  I highly recommend these  My disgruntled father even likes them despite insisting that the TV is not too loud
R328OSDVOSRJ2V,5,"I live in a condominium building and like watching the late shows on TV, so these headphones are great. I can watch TV all night and not disturb my neighbors. Or, listen to my CDs."
R1524P8DV5AUY,5,THis is the second set of these I have bought. I find them to be very good for movies. For a fair price you get a good set of headphones that can handle most ot the special effects.
R1B2QCWIRTK9OR,5,Sound Quality is awesome.
R165HFPW939MC6,2,"The tuner is very touchy.  Just placing it on the stand does not guarantee it will be recharged.  I bought it for my husband, who has alzheimers and he is constantly complaining he can't get it to work.  I used to purchase headphones that he could use but the rods to them broke so easily that I decided to try yours but am now wondering if I should have."
R2PU8FWXMK3ASW,5,"I bought this for my wife who watches a lot of TV late at night.  I get a nice sound sleep now, and she really loves these headphones.  Worth every penny."
RFK0VKQPD8BN5,3,"It took a lot of fiddling to set channel and volume level, but once set it did o.k."
R1LZB8918H0G3E,5,"My husband loves to watch movies on Netflix and likes TV louder than I...  I like a quiet house.  Since we are both retired, we are home a lot.  This wireless headphone has been so wonderful!  He uses it for hours  daily and places it on dock at night.  We have  used it for several months and  it performs perfectly.  Its easy to turn on and off and is lightweight .  5 Stars!!!!"

R3SSJHUS7VYI1Q,5,Bought these for my husband to use while watching TV.  He loves them but I love them more...no more loud TV.
R2KDBO2V323LE1,5,Excellent head phones.
R2UK4QIJR3F94H,4,works very well. can be heard all around the house. helped eliminate arguments with spouse over TV being too loud

R2ZOPZLD99APAN,5,They helped saved my marriage. LOL
R26WLNGAWB701B,5,cancels outside noise. great speaker quality. seems durable. Made my decision to purchse this headset based  on posted reviews and that paid off. Very Happy
RTJEEJ4X45LX1,4,"Pretty good phones.  Only drawback is if you lean over they fall off.  Good not amazing sound, fairly clear for wireless.  For the price reasonable."
R2M6H4P9MR8VFD,5,"I got these as a present for my husband who has wanted a pair for awhile. I did tons of research and it led me to this. The price is right, and my husband loves them! He can watch TV or play Wii without disturbing anyone, or waking up our son in the other room."
R2TEFGNRFA0VL,5,Stennheiser RE 120 wireless head phone work very well and they are very comfortable too.  I had TV ears before and they were poorly made and uncomfortable.  My wife now wants to get a second set.
R26VEPBCX7M2EV,5,Worked fine.
R1EX9T67I2V3PC,3,"Wemliked the Sennheiser ok, but it died with in a month or two."
R28EGINAZJV7XB,5,Awesome product. My husband can watch TV while I read my book in bed. Now all of my family members are buying them for their husbands
R35WY6NK05L24S,5,"Better than I expected.  Being somewhat hard of hearing, but being reluctant to turn up the TV sound, I have been forced to use close-captioning.  These headphones have allowed me to understand dialogue clearly and enjoy music at a reasonable volume and eliminate the distracting cc.  The dynamic range is impressive...comparable to wired headphones.  They would be more comfortable with over-the-ear pads instead of on-the-ear, but otherwise I'm very pleased with this purchase."
R109I252FDO79K,5,"this was a gift for my grandson. and I got one for me also. they work fine. there is some noise when I leave the room, but I have stucco walls, I'm sure that is what causes the noise."
R2Z7Z2GEL3TN92,1,lot of static.  suspect it was faulty as no one would use them otherwise.  My prime two day shipping took five days.
R3CQOCLTHLJI10,5,Works Great!
R6XAWZRI15KOE,1,"This is an update to an earlier review. The green on/off switch inexplicably  goes off when I'm using the earphones, creating ear-splitting static. It comes back and then recurs."
RR65DK5RBQP34,3,Lot of ambient noise.
R141S9I8BDV0I5,5,"Very good audio, but one thing that is a little annoying is keeping them on my head if I need to bend over. I love the fact I can walk around my house and still hear the audio portion of programming. Also I walk around the house listening to music from my music station.<br />One thing which impressed me was the background sounds that I was missing coming from my speaker.<br />My number one reason to buy the headphone is that I can not hear the TV if my wife and her friends are over and chatting away, the TV sounds and dialog becomes muddled with the background noise."
R26E3G0JJIPXR4,5,Work great and for a long distance. Sound is very good
R2F8B412A9BTBU,5,Excellent  great for listening to tv when you want a quiet room for others  great for those with hearing issues
R3LOMKMX8E0BD4,5,Helped alot and am going to get his stroke techniques
R6P43582NSBDZ,3,"First unit arrived without the power supply, returned to Amazon and they shipped out a new one. the power cord is a little short so consider where your going to connect it. for some reason the jack must be plugged in the the receiver for the main unit to power up, but then the light goes out. is it charged? i don't know. some people complain about adjusting the frequency range on the headphone with the volume, not a big deal. just feel your way around it and after a while you'll get used to it."
R3K2VIK920DJX7,3,"When I was looking for a wireless headphones for my house, it was between Sony and Sennheiser.  Due to the reviews, I ended up getting the Sennheiser RS120.<br /><br />Comfort: At first, the headphones seems a little bit on the heavy side.  But once you wear them for a minute or so, you forget they are even on.  Ear cushions are soft and cushion on top sit perfectly on the top of the head.<br /><br />Battery: Never had a problem.  Lasts hours of continual use.  Just remember to put back on charging station after use.<br /><br />Range: No problems within the same room.  Loss of sound quality once you leave the room.<br /><br />Sound:  Works great sometimes.  Other times, you hear a slight hissing in the background.  You have to mess around with the &#34;Tune&#34; to find a sweetspot.<br /><br />Overall: Not a bad option for wireless.  Somewhat dated now due to new technology such as bluetooth.  I would skip this and find better wireless earphones."
R1G2UMSSHDLE2Q,5,"Finally can turn the volume down/off, not disturb others, and hear every word on TV. Best thing I've purchased in years."
R134FBYLX7NJIA,4,Works great.  No problems. Simple to install batteries.
R24BSR3QMXIV5Z,5,"These are sensational! Excellent sound quality with great separation. Area coverage is over 200-ft in all directions, likely more but that's as far as I really wanted to be anyway. I like that it charges automatically while resting on the headset base so that I know they'll be ready to rock-n-roll when I am. Only caveat: their physical size runs on the large side so tends to slip off my head when moving around, unless wearing a Bennie or something. Def recommend!"
R1ECJEA0K3EH4B,5,Great set of ear phones
R2E7HMZ2LSWC39,5,"Wonderful sound quality, love them"
R3WIVPQE2YQGJ,5,Excellent product!  I use with hearing aids and experience great audio with no oscillation interference at all.
R1LBP9158T5ULE,2,I have only used this product since August of 2014 and one of the knobs is not working properly.  I feel that I spent my money in good faith for a decent product that would last at least a year.  I loved it when I first used it but now I am disappointed in the no warranty.
R3H1M8R46GQO0G,5,very good
R1J8CUWTP2BX81,3,"Work well but the cradle is very large for travel.  Do-able, but needs to downsize."
R1VM5QI111I87T,4,"I bought one pair, refurbished, for my ex wife. In that way she was distracted and not yelling or screaming at me. It was her pacifier, plus a lot of antidepressants. But at the end the best solution was to transfer her to an older guy."
R3407XRJ4698IL,5,Hand to get open
R1NFD9P9RXZ6OQ,1,"I hate purchasing items that simply don't work. I don't want to fool with returning getting refund etc. this product was, therefore, a distasteful for me"
R1OQUQUHP3JCYB,5,Great headphones. Will buy again.
R1Z7BNJDHHRYLM,2,Very weird to use. Not possible to use with our tv<br />Dissapointed
RBT5VQLABG9X3,5,top quality  recommend
R1D9TP8KSTL94Y,1,They worked for 1/2 hour than all I heard was static.
R2XTCSEMRRCOHT,5,"I am very pleased with these headphones!  Very clear sound and easy to tune.  Works well for TV, DVD player and stereo.  No batteries to install, just hang onto the self-charger and they are ready to use."
R5W02JHODR8M9,3,"The short:<br />An enjoyable pair of headphones, with good battery life, good audio, and a decent fit. Mine stopped working after roughly two years.<br /><br />Build:<br />Almost the entirety of the headphones are hard plastic, with the exception of the earpads, and the two pads along the top of the headset for comfort. There are two metal contacts next to the pads on the top as well. It feels solidly constructed, and after two years of wear, shows little to no signs of tear. The cables associated with the base transmitter show no sign of damage, fraying, stiffening, etc.<br /><br />Fit:<br />These headphones have no cups, and are just flat. That said, for an hour or two, the headphones feel just fine. After a good number of hours wearing them though, it's really a relief to take them off, as they press against your ears without cups. This is a double edged sword, as I've had cup headphones that aren't big enough, causing the same effect. The length of the side components are adjustable - not too resistant, and not too easily adjusted either. They slide onto the cradle nicely and easily, as only those two large contacts have to touch.<br /><br />Audio: Audiophiles would probably avoid these headphones, but the average joe would probably find these to produce satisfactory audio. The transmitter has three settings for frequency, in case there is interference on any given band (frequency). Along with this, the headphones have two potentiometers - 1 to tune to a set frequency (I assume the reason it is not a three way switch is so that minor variances in the transmitters frequencies do not create poor reception), and the other to control volume. I have occasionally mixed these up, but generally it has been on a non-issue. Overall, when the frequencies were well calibrated, I enjoyed noise free audio, with little to no interference, clipping, etc. Audio quality was similar to what I might enjoy from a pair of mid-tier earbuds.<br /><br />Transmission:<br />I am actuallysurprised by the range on these headphones. I was able to leave my apartment room, go to the shared laundry room, and change my laundry, with only a slight amount of interference. My building is made mostly of concrete, having roughly three walls between my headphone's cradle and the laundry machines. All and all, the total distance was probably 40-50 feet from the transmitter. I only had to worry about interference due to the chosen frequency channel on the cradle once or twice in my time owning them.<br /><br />Battery life:<br />I don't think I ever ran this thing dead. I could spend a long day gaming, with no fear of it dying, which could constitute up to 8 hours. I left it on the cradle when not in use, and never had an issue with the battery dying. Rechargeable batteries were definitely a beautiful invention.<br /><br />Death:<br />As my headphones were dying, static and almost a 'flickering' in sound was observed. This occurred for a few weeks, and finally one day, my headphones just stopped working. However, the headphones can still create static noise, which leads me to believe that one of the components in the transmitter failed. This was after about two years.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I give this product 3 stars. It seems to have good build quality in the headphones, although perhaps the materials could be superior. The audio was not super great, but I enjoyed many hours of good quality audio, in music, movies, TV shows, games, etc. I deduct two stars because of my failing product, and because of the uncomfortableness of wearing after a good number of hours (think upwards of three hours). I've heard great things about the Sennheiser company, and these appear to be some of their lower tier items, so I would not be surprised if my device's failure was an anomaly - but still a weighting factor on my opinion. Taking this failure out of the picture - I would recommend these headphones to any person who spends a few hours at a time utilizing their headphones ata desk, but who also wants to have a bit of mobility. Extended use is not a recommendation, due to the cupless design of the headphones. Those who are looking for superior audio quality would also probably be not interested in these headphones."
R1LU67KE8IN8C4,1,There is about 15 feet between me and the TV. There was way too much static.
R3KUYKR04T1KFD,5,Great so far! I had another brand previously - did not last 90 days so I am a sceptic. The Sennheiser is much better than my old was when it was new.
RYAF6OXMY4Q33,5,"These are great. Wish I could give them 10 stars. If you partner is in bed earlier than you and you want to be a good guy just follow their simple instructions and you'll have a comfortable pair is stereo headsets for TV shows, etc."
R26S44E4LRPCYB,5,Works like I wanted
R1FHWNRNRJC294,4,"tldr;<br />The sound quality is quite good when you figure out which audio output to use. To resolve the [quite annoying] hissing, connect the RCA plugs (red/black cable) directly to your cable box as opposed to the TV's &#34;audio out&#34; jack.<br /><br />I purchased the headphones just prior to Black Friday for $93. After charging the device for 18 hours, I connected this device to my parents' Samsung UN55C8000XFXZA (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN55C8000-55-Inch-1080p-Model/dp/B0036WT4KG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417276602&sr=8-1&keywords=un55c8000xfxza) television and first attempted to use the TV's Digital Audio Output jack, however, I received significant hissing on all 3 channels of the device. I attempted to tune the headphones on all 3 channels, but to no avail.<br /><br />I then played around with the different types of audio connections, and ultimately decided to use their cable box' RCA audio output. Using this connection, I was finally able to successfully remove the &#34;hiss&#34; that many people have reported.<br /><br />The device works as expected and when the television is on mute, the sound quality of the headphones is quite good and my parents now look forward to keeping the peace within the household."
ROCQKMPQSPJF0,2,"Had to return it because it was not functioning well. Very unlikely Sennheiser. When I called the company for repair inquiries, the woman was very customer unfriendly."
R1U0Z8AD8IXD2B,1,"Unfortunately the one that I've bought doesn't properly work. I mean in wooden and cardboard isolated houses it might run smooth and operate from distances it has indicated in the manual but in the apartments like mine, where there's concrete and brick walls It works horribly. I don't know maybe It's particularly the one that I've got that can't even handle even 3-3.5 feet away from the receiver without making terrible distortion noise... Anyways I personally wouldn't recommend this model, Sennheiser in general is known world wide for it's hi quality products bit this particular model doesn't seem to live even to the minimal expectations one might have. I'd definitely recommend either a different brand or Sennheiser with bigger range and with much stronger receiver that handles the signal transmission well"
R14O7N3MVUBYL0,5,Once you use these for TV watching you may never want to be without them.  I have a little hearing loss but even my husband finds that the voices are much more clear while using these.  I can go into the basement and out to the yard no problem.  The trick to not getting static or hiss is to turn the volume all the way up on the TV and use the dial on the headset for volume control.
R2DWUA3AFKCYHA,3,Stick to wired folks!
RXJH3UDVZ9Y23,5,"Bought these for my wife, she loves the sound quality, comfort, positive recharging. Her old set didn't charge if anything caused them to be less than perfectly cradled. Installation is easy, This unit has separate lights displaying power and charge."
R2JGCMTV8MF6WP,1,"Died in 35 days so am stuck with a useless piece of crap, Amazon has a 30 day exchange/return policy that starts from the order date not the in received/in service date. Bought this because of the Sennheiser name but was very disappointed. This was to replace a Radio Shack wireless headphone that I've had for over 20 years. It finally quit working hence the purchase."
RQ28ADX2CFHVT,4,"Love these!  They don't just amplify sound, they make it clearer.  I can still hear it in another room.  One drawback is the headset is too wide and the width is not adjustable so if I bend my head down they fall off"
R18MSROX4MBB28,1,"Don't waste your money on this crap. It has three channels: bad, worse, and worst. It may work somewhere in the country where there is no radio traffic.  Having experienced this, I don't  know how wireless telephones with four handsets can work properly.  I would send it back but lost the package."
R1UQH5GRHI01SC,1,"I bought these wireless headphones to watch tv without bothering my girlfriend. I use them to watch amazon prime, netlifx or play xbox. Whenever I'm using a video streaming service there is radio interference about every 5 mins. Sound quality is ok when just watching regular tv but there is still frequent radio interference so you end up missing bits of audio. Not bad for sports but if your watching a tv show it gets really annoying.<br /><br />I'm looking into buying another pair of higher quality headphones and will trash these as soon as I do. Regretting not going with something higher quality form the start."
R1JKJ3S74EULE5,5,"Very comfortable. My son's room is right behind my TV, so these are invaluable."
R2M11U3PJ13KQ3,5,The sound is excellent and the range is outstanding. Love the built-in charger.
R4YD3XIV5T47E,4,"I am almost deaf in one ear and the other is not so good,  so these are really great, able to adjust the volume right on the headset. The only thing I have a problem with is I were glasses and the tension on the headset presses fairly tight on the frames causing some discomfort."
R3RTSIBBUC1BP8,1,Didn't work with the tv for which it was purchased.
R27A8QS3MD21OD,5,Great headphones
RKCDE3SK4JQJO,5,Good Headphones for the price
R1VQ6L6KDBC2IN,5,"quality sound,easy to hook up."
R1EES8ZTE1I1OV,3,"The sound is iffy, it goes up and down if you move your head.  The stereo goes in and out."
R2BCGRJXTMORF8,2,I am not sure what genius had the idea of putting the fine tune control directly below the volume control but that makes this a DO NOT BUY product! It's very difficult to simply reach up and turn the volume up or down without hitting the fine tune also. The fine tune should have been on the side with the on/off switch but it isn't. I give it a two star because it does have a good range of 150' before it starts to cut out. I can work outside and still hear without the sound cutting in and out even with the mower running. It sits easily on the cradle for charging so theres no cords to plug in and unplug.
RKJ1Y0XT1TXZM,4,We got one of these  a few years ago and just ordered this one for the bedroom - it's a life/ear saver!
R2UD3S8QR67PW3,4,"Love the sound, the charger stand and the range, I would like a different material on the ear pieces"
R3K8RU68ZBK12Q,5,now I can watch tv on a normal volume. And my husband can turn his volume as loud as he wants.
RYQAWI8ZN3VB2,5,Great purchase. Awesome headphones.
R21EA44R54JXUV,5,I was spectacle because the prior set that I used daily for 12 yrs that my son purchased for me was so great. Well I must say I am very happy and pleased with this unit. I use it daily and the charging station is so cool and easy to use.  The range is remarkable and the sound is super clear. The headset is so soft and comfortable. I love it.
R2S3SG7F7MLDEN,2,Less than I expected.  Battery life is very poor.
R3B4IAGQTZ6Z6Y,5,LOve it and use it all the time
R34DRZ633X3Y9N,5,My husband loves them. He says it sounds like you are in the theater. We love them because the tv is not so loud.
RPVNCX2QURMWZ,5,Met all of our expectations at a very good price!  Thank you.
R15824Q46SP94Q,5,"The RS120Great. This is so much better then any of my previous units. You have a much wider volume range and it is so easy to charge<br />You just hang the head set on your base, no trying to match up the small connection from head set to base. A wonderful price<br />for the high quality. You can't go wrong with the RS120."
RSQ2FMF6Z7QU7,5,"Supreme, love it. Recommend highly."
R3OYDIDWMTSE5,1,"I was looking to buy headphones that would allow me to watch TV without bothering my husband. I followed the setup and charging instructions to the letter. When they worked, the sound was great, but the longest they worked for was 1 1/2 hours. I thought maybe the rechargeable batteries were bad so I replaced them but it didn't help. It is so incredibly frustrating to get 10 to 20 minutes into a movie or TV program only to have the sound quit while massive static fills your ears. I had high hopes for these headphones but they have been a huge disappointment. I definitely would not recommend them to anyone."
RKJBTUC52IH5G,5,Great sound!
R2FBRR91O32W2V,5,"I am very pleased with my purchase.  The earphones are clear, actually operate quite far from the base unit,  and are very comfortable."
R180AYS96FUE06,4,very helpful - sound comes in clearly although sometimes there is a bit of static - ear pads cause some irritation on the skin of my ears after long term usage
R3V46MOFWOVHGL,5,"The best television earphones I've ever had! And that is a fact! Thanks,..."
R26VZFA5Z3K967,5,"Loud and clear,,,,,,,I have trouble with clarity,,,,,this item is great love it……."
RYSWYOD9DOH4V,1,"Very Disappointing! These headphones require you to manually tune in a signal.  The last time I had to do that was when watching Howdy Doody on my Dumont black and white TV! This is the digital age, why the analog tuner? If that were the only problem, I probably would have kept the headphones but even when tuned in, there is an annoying hiss.  If you're listening to TV, this might be ok when the audio level is relatively constant. However, if you're listening to classical music with a long quiet passage, you'll hear the annoying hiss."
R9LJ3T2VM63K8,4,nice so I can listen to my Stern in the morning while my wife sleeps. also for treadmill in basement so I don't have to blast speakers to hear over hum of treadmill......
R11IC00IR3FV0S,4,Works great.
R2NMUMZY57611H,5,"I don't see why people slag on these. My wife is hard of hearing, and she is able to watch late night TV with no problems. I have checked them out, (I am up some nights now and then) and the sound quality is excellent. I am a musician, and these sound ALMOST as good as my TASCAM Studio Headphones. This checked ALL of our boxes and definitely last longer than some people have suggested. Just between us, I have &#34;drop-checked&#34; them more than once. I recommend them."
RGRI6OXI6FI3A,5,"I am truly impressed with the wireless headphones, giving me excellent sound definition, especially watching sports games, allowing you to hear the noise of the crowd, nearby voices in 3D, much better than my former experience with surround sound."
R2ZZP05HTW18F9,4,"The sound is great.  The range is great.  There is clarity.  My only problem is the fact that it doesn't power up until you turn the sound source on.  That's confusing as I kept thinking the power adapter was not connected (it's also a terrible location).  Once you realize that issue it's a great product.  I bought it used and Amazon certified. For the discount, i'd recommend going that route."
R12NFM2AAPDIT9,5,This is a great set of headphones. I have a couple of sets now so I can use them on different audio sources in the house. The range is amazing and I can even go out to the street and still hear my program. I often wear them for hours and don't get soar ears from the pressure.
R1GM7MRTC6F47C,2,"These started out OK. But very quickly, tuning in the sound source at a good volume, became more and more difficult. After a year, the need to fiddle around with the RF tuning became harder. Then about 5 months ago the shell became loose, adding another dimension to the challenge of tuning. Finally this past month I've just given up on them, after buying a new set of covers for the ear pieces. I'm not sure that if going to another TV ear headset system might not be cheaper than the $80 to replace these funky, flimsy headphones."
R3F03J4QG1PI3S,5,"excellent headphones, great brand"
R4CMQTXNYK8FS,5,"I have 2 of these,they are very good, I love them."
R2KTATSI7RG6HE,5,This is the greatest gift to myself that I could get.  No one  in my apartment complex knows when I am watching TV.
R2MBFGY73DBZ8Z,5,"Great sound, very comfortable, and most of all does not disturb spouse while trying to watch sports..."
R2K2NMOCNDEZ4M,5,Very satisfied
R3DFVV14A5RIZ1,5,"Easy to hook up to the TV, great sound and stylish. The used set came in an orignal box and so far no issues."
R3KDKZZ38MR2U8,3,"Work great, sound good, but nowhere near as comfortable as other pairs I've had unfortunately."
R105YONP86X3AK,5,"We love these, this is a second pair.  Would definitely recommend these for anyone who is hard of hearing or just wants to knock out background noise when trying to watch TV"
R3RRS8HAMBEA6V,5,"I have tried several sets of 'wireless headphones' and will state without reservation as these are my second set - &#34;These are the greatest headphones for the slightly hard of hearing'.  They set up easily, are very comfortable to wear, even over long periods of time and block out the extraneous noise when properly placed over the ears.  I hardly know how to thank the design engineers for these as they help to alleviate excess volume and allow my wife to listen to any program we are watching at a normal level without my chasing her from the room because I can't hear the dialogue.  In addition, thank you Amazon for delivery that was on time and without any problems what so ever."
R332QH1EU1TKBD,5,They work all right for the price
R2RVNG4F97RKZO,5,only one word  Excellent
R1G4F2XNYY1D7G,5,"I needed a way to watch Tv while the wife sleeps in bed. We are on different work schedules and this headset is the answer to our problem. The headset is comfortable and if you keep the volume at a reasonable level, my wife a few feet away can't hear anything. We have not had any issues with static or transmission issues. I can even walk downstairs wearing the headset without hearing any static."
RMIFAP6VOFJ6T,5,"Best Christmas present I've ever bought - my husband gets to watch football without any wires, and I don't have to listen to ESPN all weekend;)"
R3RBQJP1NQKADK,1,I bought this wireless headphone with an extra headset for TV watching at night. They performed well until a couple of months ago. There was some little hiss as mentioned by other reviewers. But I can live with it by slightly adjust the position/angle of my head.<br /><br />The biggest issue is both headphones became silent on left ear. For one of them I can adjust the volume button to make it work randomly. The other one is dead for good.<br /><br />I used other headphones from Sennheiser as well. Never been so disappointed.
R1WB94WI7KNBM2,5,"Great Item, Thanks!"
R1BCSMUO4RDOF7,5,The sound is great. In fact you can hear the sound with better detail than when listening through the tv speakers.
R35FIFOWKGKLGL,4,no problems or issues.  delivered in good condition as promised.  i will buy from this seller again.
R2EZANPYKPRGDD,5,My &#34;hearing impaired&#34; (HA) husband of 42+ years loves this particular brand!!  :)
R3O0WOR4P5QQ5C,5,"Bought these for my hard of hearing husband. He loves them, has even said he loves them several times. He likes that he can walk around the house, go outside to smoke, go to the bathroom and not miss hearing a thing. He also said they're comfortable and do not put pressure on his ears. I like that he can lay in bed watching NASCAR while I'm in bed reading and I don't hear a thing! Great item, highly recommend!"
R2VG339ZK55DBI,4,"I really enjoy them.  Good Sound.  Hard to lay supine in bed thought, they want to slide off.  Perfect for the sitting position."
R2BPKBB1IERY3U,5,"For the reasonable price these are super!  Easy, with fine sound quality"
RH5WBJCZAMUX5,5,Best headphones for private listening to TV.....best I have found yet.......Very well made....
R2JR8X3CWRK6BD,5,I really like these headphones They work great. I've never used wireless before so having them work easily was an important test. They even pick up radio stations when I unplug my iPhone.    The only thing that I don't like is that they are super uncomfortable to carry... wish they came with a bag.
R28JZA0KS37UTH,5,"These are my 1st set of wireless headsets, I charged the battery's for 24 hours & turned them on and they are Awesome!! Make sure you have Dolby turned on your TV I can walk around into different rooms without static the sound is nice and clear I recommend these to anyone who wants to hear their TV in peace, they are a simple set up and the charging cradle is convenient."
R1Z8XB13KFX0VY,5,Best wireless headphones on the market.  I can wear these outside while cutting the lawn with no breakup or static.  Once you get them adjusted they are excellent.  Good range.  Good sound.  Very comfortable on the ear.  Highly recommend.
R3F1DN6JJ2YZKR,5,I have 4 of these and they are perfect sound quality and work exyremely well.
RE0SD4SN0YWUQ,5,This set is pretty awesome. They are really comfortable  (unless I wear them with my glasses for a length of time) and the sound is great. Worth it!
R3U8AHYDVISHMT,1,"Didn't work. Sent it back, which is easy to do with Amazon."
R15Q969M0E6RA9,5,"These are great headphones. Lightweight, excellent range and good sound with strong bass."
R19MFM3TGE039I,5,"Flawless. I am hard of hearing due to playing in a rock band, Stood right in front of an amp on stage,<br /><br />My wife and I have been fighting about how I have to turn the volume up and that drives her nuts. So it was time to make a change.<br />Having had the experience of working with Sennheiser headphones and microphones in the studio a swore about them regarding quality and definition. And that what I get from my stereo system. The run for about 20 hours per charge. And now my wife and I get along much better. Works for me."
R3AYRD0LS46K4Y,5,"I purchased this used from Amazon, though the product in the box looked as if it hadn't been opened.<br />It was easy to connect and works well. I use it for watching TV after my spouse is asleep. It's perfect for that, though with my 40&#34; Sony TV, the sound from the TV speakers shuts off when the 3.5mm headphone jack has something plugged into it. This means you need to plug the base connector in when these are in use, and unplug when you want sound from the TV speakers. To get around this I purchased a Fiio D3 (D03K) Digital to Analog Converter (comes with optical cable) here on Amazon and connected the headphone base unit with an optical cable from the optical audio out port on my TV. Now I only need to mute the TV speakers using the mute button on the TV remote and listen to the headphones adjusting their volume with the volume control on the headset.<br />The reception on the headphones work best when the volume level on your TV is turned up a bit so the bass unit can recognize the signal.<br /><br />For music? Well, if you're an audiophile you might be bothered by occasional static pops from the wireless function, but for TV watching these are perfect. The wireless function means there's no cord stretched across the room for someone to trip over. The used price was what I think of as a great bargain. Thank You Amazon-"
R1Z368GOD9IUYV,4,This is my 2nd one and they both work as expected ( GREAT ).
R5MNAVZHX3ZNW,3,"As of today 3,147 reviewers indicate that these are as good as any head set made (5 stars).  I do not see (hear) how this is possible.  Certainly, for the money, this is a decent set but there clearly are some problems.  As stated by others there is often some hiss.  The tuning control is a bit course, it is often difficult to hit the 'sweet' spot for the best sound.  These are not as comfortable  as many others.  That being said this is a fairly good 'first set' of wireless phones.  The sound is adequate for the price and the range is fairly good.  Of course if you really want to listen to music a cheaper set of wired phones will give better sound and be more comfortable.  Stopped working after 18 months - boooo."
RJQMDH85WHJ5K,4,"This is my third set. While they work great, they are huge. I have a big head, and they are still huge.<br />If you are an audiophile looking for great sound, I cannot say good or bad.<br />If you are an old guy going deaf and your wife complains the TV is too loud and you don't mind the huge ears, these are great.<br />Why? Independent volume control. She has the remote, you have the volume control on the headset. Also, they are radio, not infrared. This means you can get up and get your wife a beverage without loosing the sound. WinWin.<br />The later models have much better rechargeable batteries. Keep them stored on the charging stand and you will be good for 4 or 5 hours of TV that you can hear. (They don't interpret, so you still might be confused.)<br />Don't pay full price. $50 max. A lot of people buy these and then look in the mirror and return them. So you can get them cheaper. And don't look in the mirror."
R2DVCZFTE0I8S3,5,This product did exactly as I expected. Very clear and comfortable.
R15WVSDYX7DS5S,4,"I like these headphones, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd get a USB Bluetooth adapter and a set of Bluetooth earbuds. It just didn't occur to me at the time. Unlike Bluetooth, these wireless headphones require that they be tuned to their receiver.  It's not a big deal, but it's an extra step Bluetooth doesn't require.  That aside, they're good headphones, although the more I think about it, the more likely they are to end up on eBay."
R3CMM7QEUIU4GI,3,"This works well with my lap top. It has allot of noise with my I Jam. I fool with the dial to try to dial the noise out, which it seems is impossible to get rid of. I have tried all three channels. Same problem. It must not be compatible, with the I jam. Which is a shame, since that is what I bought them for,<br /> to use with the I jam"
R18CTEPVE7V6SQ,5,it works good
R29NCA3845UINP,5,"I am so glad I finally decided to purchase these headphones! I  may have just saved my marriage! My husband goes to sleep before 9pm and I am a night person, and I watch tv in bed until the early morning hours. My husband always ends up waking up and going to sleep on the couch every night! And he never seems pleased about it. So I ordered these headphones, which come with a convenient charging cradle, and problem solved! I have to mention that i could not hook it up to my tv directly, but it connected to my DVR very easily. And the sound is great for watching tv. I use the headphones whenever I am alone watching tv because the sound is so much better! I have a sound bar but the speakers sound better. I can walk to the basement and everywhere else in my house and it sounds great."
R2B2ZJIH0O1D2N,2,Sound Quality is poor. RF interference and static noise. I don't recommend.
RRWAA4A4OOT8E,5,"we like these headphones so much that we bought a second pair for another room. Range of the wireless is great, I can leave the room to get a snack without losing reception. I have never had headphones run out of battery charge and have used them for several hours at a time.  Before purchasing the headphones it was often difficult to make out what actors were saying or to distinguish words from background noise, but with the headphones it's easy to understand everything. These are very clear and we have not had any problems with static or interference"
R29XK2ROXFJ7I0,5,My husband loves these things because he can hear so much more of the details in movies. I normally make him keep the volume low to keep from waking the kid.
R1JAKGWUF1CYZC,5,Works great
R2925OZRLP1EDL,5,"Good product, quick delivery."
R1SHP0D4JON2V5,3,Item is well made and works as described. They were a bit tight fitting over glasses frames and after a while were painful to my right ear. I can't recommend these if you were glasses.<br /><br />There was a small amount of hiss but that's common with all analog wireless headphones. The deal breaker to me was an audible click every second from which I cannot locate the source. I have a lot of electronics here and couldn't pinpoint what was causing it.<br /><br />The stand worked well and is a good design for charging.
R3IMAA5BYOSJLG,5,I think the headphones are remarkable.  I can really hear everything very clearly.
R1L10U7MJ9AAXM,4,Excellent
RYITP6342Q4Q0,5,These headphones work quite well. They block out noise so I can hear my TV very clearly.
R1AJUDSYNIZJNG,5,Maintains connectivity over a nice range. I can actually walk to the kitchen and never lose sound.
RDXREVWTVCGRU,5,"I was looking for headphones to use when watching TV at night, when my wife and daughter were sleeping. My daughter bought these for me last Christmas and they are awesome. I waited until now to give a review after using them for 11 months to show just how good these headphones are. Very comfortable to wear with very good sound. The battery life is great as well as the range that you can move away from the transmitter. I can walk throughout my house with clear reception. The sound is crystal clear. All in all I am very happy with these headphones and I highly recommend them."
R1TTXMYA7HQGH,5,"I bought this for my sister, she has some hearing loss and can't hear much of the words on the TV - it worked perfectly, and now she can hear all the words. I listened to it and it was very good sound quality. I will be buying one for myself! I really appreciate the RCA to 1/4 and 1/8 jacks. makes the unit very versatile"
R3NEO1B60PK8L,4,"works great,all sounds nice and clear"
R2KB4NV21AZXEH,5,My old RS130 was not working so I ordered the RS120.  Apparently the problem was with the transmitter in the base because I now<br />have a set for my wife and one for myself.
RY6ICTODRFWFV,5,Great headphones and fast delivery! Sennheiser is a quality product with great sound!!!
R1AKG2X4TKHO3T,4,"I purchased these a few years ago, I love them. They work great. I can leave the room with the headphones on and still hear very clearly."
R10BU9T2F46QO8,5,Peace in the TV room AGAIN!
R3QEUEW23JXI4W,5,I like it a lot.  Works well.
RYFMEYY42VPFK,5,Bought these for my husband he loves them extremely comfortable highly recommend
R18G28WVOAXF9N,3,"Sometimes they work, and sometime it does not produce sound.  Needs to be charged every day."
R12GUVHS8K0ROY,5,Fills the need
R2DM73EV3NUIYD,5,"The sound is HD quality and much better then produced by our TV. Headphones are comfy (I am very picky for anything covering my ears), wireless capability allows me to do things around without disturbing sleepy house and still follow my favorite evening show. It took me a while to figure out how to connect it to my TV, but it is not headphones, rather TV and mine problems.<br /><br />The only annoying feature is the loud white noise I start to hear if no sound stream is detected by headphones for a couple of minutes. This is a &#34;turn down&#34; feature of the unit, which disconnects wireless channel to save the batteries, but it is often happens while I am still choosing that to watch next (everybody with Netflix or Amazon Prime know you search longer than you actually watch...No offense, simply too many choices). It will be great if such functionality would have on/off switch somewhere on the cradle.<br /><br />Overall, one of my favorite purchases of the year."
R2SQXGNWYNAPOJ,5,We have used TV ears for years. Husband wears hearing aids. Watched tv now without disturbing me.  We have used other brand with ear buds but these soft overear are better for long term use.
R1GKCTFN295I4K,5,This sweet little device allows me to work (I'm a writer) at night when my husband is watching a war movie. He's hard of hearing and normally turns the volume up TOO high.  I LOVE IT!
R3HZ5740PJ1AED,2,"Works okay for FM headphones, with a single exception:  the unit doesn't transmit unless it detects audio, and the headphones will blast static at full volume if the unit isn't transmitting.  I'm sure they'd be great for watching TV in an apartment or other continuous use, but I planned to use them as wireless headphones for my computer.  When I'm watching or listening to something, they work fine.  When the movie, tv show, or song ends, however, I get treated to a blast of static in my ears unless I immediately start playing something else.<br /><br />These headphones are meant to be plugged into a line-level source (not a headphone jack unless you turn the volume on the source up to full).  There's a very low-level hiss that the FM transmission adds to the audio, and using low level audio as a source makes it much more pronounced.  Source volume should be as loud as possible without clipping, and then turned back down on the headset to avoid the hissing."
R1A2ALMR8I0QZL,1,"Guys, it's 21 century here, how could anyone like those?<br /><br />Those are not comfortable, sound quality is on par with 1$ headsets. Don't buy those! For this price there is a lot of newer headphones out there."
R2J01TZMXU9315,3,"I have limited experience at this time, however if it continues to function as stated I will be pleased. The headset appears to be set without adjustment for a head with less width, therefore a bit tight and warm."
R3NKVBR3SNWESH,5,Helps me to hear the tv over the loud crazy house
R2CBRVED30UOIS,1,Got this confused with the sennheiser's above.  Lousy sound for television watching. Mostly static though it does cut out the background noise in the house very well.
R2J9GJJL8AXZUI,5,My wife loves these things. Now I can listen comfortably at a reasonable TV volume.
RCXFLYPPDH8VY,1,nothing but static even after buying a converter from digital
R3NWFJG6RYVZLM,5,"Comfortable. Easy to place on recharging cradle. Excellent surround sound. I use the headphones for watching TV. Can mute the sound from the TV and turn it up in the headphones as loud as I want without disturbing anyone else. It is difficult to hear anything else going on in the room while wearing these. Range is good, can leave the TV room and go into the kitchen, 40 ft away and still hear just as well. My hearing is failing so these are PERFECT!"
R3RH874GG03WVT,2,"It's not adjustable and after wearing it a while it starts to hurt the head, plus I was hoping to wear them and get chores done but they fall off when you bend over.  They do have good sound though."
R3DEKYR5AS1TUR,3,Not very good quality. It sounds fine. But I suppose it was better...
RJEDX41Z2NI7V,4,Sound quality is about entry-level HI-FI. The wireless is definitely cool.
R3PRX0NC726PJ7,5,very good set for listening to a TV on the other side of the wall without disturbing other people
R3EOE1PBNLJ7T6,5,Item as described. Thanks!
RQZJ4AEYJ5P6J,5,"Great product!<br /><br />Wish they had a way to plug in a set of ear buds to them, let the headset be the wireless part.....oh well."
R3K7FKNECM92MM,4,"For the money it's pretty good. Good sound, but it could be made a little better. I'm worried about it lasting a long time."
R2JQFACSXOBQ91,3,"These have great sound and are perfect for when I want to go to sleep before my husband or vise versa.  The sound is crisp and clear and easily adjustable.  They only lasted about 9 months though, but the price isn't too bad so I'm ordering another set."
R1IJQG8Z96IQXM,5,"EXTREMELY high quality, and the range is amazing. I literally walked from my home to the grocery store and still got signal (although the store is admittedly about a 10th of a mile lol)"
R134AQULAJQLEE,5,Great sounding headphones for the price. Good range can listen through out the house. They are comfortable and like the fact it has rechargeable batteries.
R1RFCWKCJAZPN3,5,I bought these for my father do he can hear his tv better. now he walks thru the house during commercials wearing them so he doesn't miss any of his show.he's very happy with them.
RT82FHNKEOTW7,5,"Very satisfied and enjoyable . A pleasure to use for 6 weeks when suddenly no verbal sound, only static."
R39B1QQRYN2M2C,5,"Good item, good quality, good value.  My husband and I picked these after looking at several items in the same price range and this one beat out the others in terms of reviews... he's had them for several months now and I haven't heard any concerns or complaints.  We're not using them for intense music-listening or anything like that, mainly television."
RXLB3WENYL4ZZ,3,Works great but I had to repair the power cord at the plug in side as the wires were broken.  Wife listen to tv while I sleep.
R2X3NABZSSDAHV,5,"This is my second one of this model . I also have two other headsets by this company .I had to call the company to get some technical information ,I was very pleased to get a guy who had all the answers ,although he had an Australian accent I could understand him.It's great to buy headphones from Sennheiser at an affordable price and great quality ,but to get a tech support guy that immediately solves your problem.Kudos to Sennheiser."
R1KEUGVABZH81S,4,"Ehhhh...I should have done a little more research on these. I now realize what I expected were bluetooth headphones. Sure enough, the headphone itself is wireless but that bulky box/charger/transmitter has to remain tethered to the device (my laptop) and it's too much crap sitting on my bed. Also, the headset is very LARGE. I feel like I am wearing a helmet. All that aside, and no fault of the device itself -- only my own ignorance is to blame...the sound on these is FANTASTIC! I took a star because there is a hiss sometimes but if you can finagle the tuner and the volume, you can usually get around that. I will put these by the television for family use. I am sure the kids will put them to work. I'm off in search of a more dainty bluetooth set. As of 10/31/14, the Sennheiser set was about $88. I definitely declare them worthy of that price based on the sound quality alone. They sound every bit as good as my Bose OE2i that easily cost twice as much."
RMXZHMLRK51NK,5,These were purchased to replace an old set of Sony earphones that were heavy and only worked line-of-sight.  I can wear these throughout the house and still hear the TV.  The sound quality is outstanding and they fit my head perfectly.  The charging station is convenient and effective.
R1EDDR3YTUARAN,5,Thanks!
R3IQR260ERZU97,5,These headphones have good quality sound and at 69 I have a little problem with hearing so now I don't have to strain to hear what's being said on TV.
R159ZVKRQXHYGF,4,"The headphones work well, although they go into static mode when the TV is on mute or before the movie starts emitting sound.  That's annoying.  The fit is not as snug as I would have liked either."
R16HRDVV2QHJVS,5,"I love them! Now I  can hear all the words clearly.Wonderful,"
R2TN87EMSDSP03,5,"Don't get a divorce, buy these instead. It's cheaper! This is my 2nd set. It's amazing how much more audio you hear in TV and movies. Even a bit scary.. i.e. &#34;what the heck was that? I've never heard that before&#34;. You also don't have to subject others to shows that they are not a fan of.. (none of my of course). The built in charging is a plus. My last set had replaceable batt's. Wireless distance is amazing.. Seems to go through lots of walls with ease. You'll find yourself not missing your show if you have to leave the room to the other side of the house, or even outside, in my experiences. Will buy again."
RAZNK4YYRJUWT,5,The best!
R26M9GA6PLT93L,4,For a wireless headphone for under $99.00 I was more than satisfied.with its range and sound.
R12IV9R9W73SVI,5,comfortable. easy to use. works great. no problems.
R26YTDT71UIYXU,3,"DISAPPOINTED IN THESE HEADPHONES. I HAD AN &#34;EL  CHEAPO&#34; BRAND FOR YEARS, AND THEY WORKED BETTER! I WON'T SPEND THE MONEY ON THESE, OR SIMILAR, AGAIN."
R2F2EP5DHJ5YYT,4,This works well for me when I need to watch shows while the family sleeps.
R2AF19S47DYMTD,5,"Once we connected it correctly, my husband loves it."
R26RF7B8RKO328,5,Wow!  These work great!
R20X516ZF9B8RI,5,"Just got these and set them up yesterday so I can watch late night TV in bed while my wife sleeps soundly.  They were a SNAP to set up, and the sound is amazing.  The bass is so much better than just using the TV speakers!!"
R27MC08NLR0CSB,5,"These are wonderful! My husband has hearing problems, and we usually have to have the TV volume up pretty high. It drove me crazy when he would watch TV at night after I'd gone to bed. While watching TV before, he would constantly ask &#34;What did they say?&#34; He suggested I buy these for him as a gift. I am so glad I did! He uses them most of the time, and I'm not deafened by the loud TV! My daughter even uses them on Saturday mornings if she gets up early."
R7UYROB534QSE,1,"The fabric padding on these headphones is slippery and at the slightest movement of the head they fall off. My head is not small so that isn't the problem. Also there is a considerable hiss due to interference with other electronics in the house. Everybody has lots of electronics next to TV these days so there is a chance you'll have the same problem. Also, when TV is muted, the headphones are picking up a radio station, faintly but you can still hear it. The sound is so-so. No deep bass at all.<br />Anyway, I would really not recommend these to anybody."
R2IS3MZYQ9XAWV,4,"Has a weird issue where it won't always work with PS3. Games won't work. sometimes movies and Netflix work. however I have pulled the PS3 off the system so it's no longer an issue. But I just thought I would post that if you are looking for a something for quiet gaming in the house, look elsewhere. Great for TV and DVD playback on dedicated DVD players."
R2B7607YANFKLH,4,Worked well for a year then built up static in headphones. Company replaced with new pair which sounded great but is now (about 1 year) starting to build some static.
R2BEZWOGHROH2I,5,I watch TV in bed at night while Wife sleeps. Makes for happy marriage.
R1RNBVJ1CCJLCJ,5,"I received this as a birthday gift from my wife. I was worried that headphones like these would be either uncomfortable, or not very well built. I have been using them for six weeks and so far they have worked great. They are very comfortable and enable me or anyone in the family to watch TV without disturbing anyone else. We like to congregate in the family room to talk, play games, do homework and watch TV. But it can be so annoying for the people who are not interested in whatever is on the tube. So these headphones allow us to watch our shows at full volume without interfering with everyone else. They also allow me to watch a late night movie at full volume while the rest of the family sleeps.<br />I like how the stand doubles as a charging station so I don't have to worry about them going dead. Setting them up was simple. Using them is as simple as flipping a switch on the headphones to turn them on and then turning down the volume on the TV. On occasion I do get a little static and so there is an adjustment dial to help with that. There are also several &#34;channels&#34; for transmitting from the base to the headphones in case one of them isn't working particularly well. I have only had to adjust that one time.<br />I cannot speak much to their durability as I have only had them a short time, but they appear to be well built. If that changes I will revise my review.<br />The sound quality is very good; not magnificent, but very good. All in all I really like these headphones and am satisfied with them."
R3PGDCDT0YNG1O,4,These phones work very good. The only thing I can say negative is that they are very heavy.
R2X62S5AZZ4K69,3,They sound very good. But they are uncomfortable on my ears. They<br />make my ears hurt.
R1JLNQ9JL50UZ0,5,These are great and I'm enjoying TV again.
RW2MBUOZXM8B6,1,Did not do the job.  Returned it!
RVQ53WXHBPVYM,2,"Pitiful performance.  Lots of static.  I have suffered with these while watching TV for two years.  Finally bit the bullet and got a new pair from Audio Unlimited through Amazon.  The difference is night and day.  While the Sennheiser were barely tolerable, the new ones are a joy to use.  Would not recommend the Sennheiser."
R26VJMWJTVR8EU,4,"Fairly comfortable, good sound and volume.  Lacks control for bass/treble, but not required.  Easy to charge.  I use for TV<br />watching, and these fit the bill for replacing my broken TV Ears."
R1KX1DCB1UTKL6,5,Work great!  I use them all the time while watching TV and listening to music.
R24D4CE192XDGF,4,good
R1PQ1YTOUYVO5U,1,Tried 2 sets of these headphones because of Sennheiser name.  Returned both 1st set for replacement 2nd set for refund.  Neither sets transmitter functioned.  Was looking forward to having the freedom of wireless headset but was disappointed.  Eventually hardwired standard headset with cable around baseboard of room.
R2C6JJWMFVQ317,5,Work great - my wife uses these while watching TV in be at night and they have worked flawlessly.
RRD5EH517RQEO,5,"After several Rocket Fish systems failure, I have found a set of headphones that transmit everywhere I go throughout the house. Excellent piece of workmanship!"
R1FNAY2ZQW2NG3,5,This is by far the best headphone set I have used in the past ten years!
R8B9IQ663BURO,5,"Love these headphones.  The sound is crystal clear and the British accent is suddenly understandable on the Sherlock TV show, as well as Masterpiece Mysteries."
R3NNUH779JA6L4,2,"I have found these headphones are not always consistent from day to day use. Also difficult to adjust tone and volume. Also they do not allow much movement as in being in the kitchen or bending over, they slide off."
RCYR02B1F04D2,4,works fine  glad I bought it
RERTLF0G5EWQ8,2,"I'm 10 feet from it in a straight line with no obstructions and constantly hear little annoying pops and static.<br /><br />The ear pieces feel sort of cheap too.  And it doesn't hold on your head very well, so when you bend over it can swing off your head.  Instead of having a horseshoe shape, it's more of a &#34;U&#34; shape.<br /><br />It works fine and I still use it to watch TV at night and not disturb anyone but it seems overpriced at ~$100."
R3RXNYQQ2LSSEI,1,"The overall quality of these phones seemed ok however, the cover to the battery compartment opened way to easily.  I was purchasing this for elderly use which made this very inconvenient."
R32DZFRGNQK69D,2,"It's a low quality prduct! The first problem is its switcher, it make a lot noise when you turned it and have to waite a while to clear. the wireless  also not good, every timeyour have to optimize. The batteries are horrible, bad connection and have to recharge often. So I have to return it."
R8A97PKQIYV2E,5,"I use these every morning as I am a very early riser (4am) and don't want to disturb the rest of the household by watching the news on tv at this hour.  They are comfortable and I can walk anywhere in our house and not lose the signal.  I have no idea how long the battery lasts, I use it for 3-4 hours every morning and place back on the charging stand and have never run out of battery."
R3F3CK6PMFEKTX,3,"Unfortunately this one didn't live up the other one we had which was a slightly higher model which was great. In terms of personal use it was gifted to the older folks and they complained it wasn't functioning correctly unfortunately and had to be returned. I imagine it was due to fine tuning required or damaged, I can't say as I personally wasn't the one in operation of it. Sennheiser has some great products but I would avoid this one and spend the extra for the Hassel free models they produce if your not extremely tech savvy to some things."
RHA9110HICZZV,5,These headphones are spot on! I can only say they are Ace! They work with my smart TV and Netflix. My partner sleeps soundly while I watch TV. I would highly recommend them.
R213LSFOSG5W9T,5,Works great.  I highly recommend.
R47GJ78X3ZXZU,5,One of the best electronic devices I've ever purchased. It works in any room in the house and even most of the back yard. The only problem is that it works with only one TV at a time. Excellent buy and highly recommended.
R1AY3G3UC1E0R0,5,"Very good for the price. Easy to set up. good sound. I have not taken them more that 20 feet from the sound source, but up to that distance they work fine. I would have preferred that the sound cables not be hard wired directly into the base. Most RCA cables that people have around the house are male-to-male. To extend, in this case you will need a male-to-female extension."
R21HDY50TDQHEP,1,"Sad day. Bought the charging stand and two headsets. Charging stand was inoperable out of the box, had to return. Never got to experience the wonders of this product. Sad day."
R1AB51NTDR1RPH,5,"Exactly what I needed to enhance my listening pleasure without blowing out my husband's eardrums!  Also, the low cost made it a no brainer allowing us both to peacefully enjoy programs together.  Find it extremely helpful when he's napping and I'm watching a program."
R3CLRVL5Q5389C,5,These have been a god sent! I ordered these to connect to my TV so I wouldn't keep my husband up at night watching TV in bed. The sound is spectacular! I've never had the battery run low. Just throw them on the charging stand when done and leave them there until your next use.
R12HUDH1DU0W3R,5,LOVE THE HEADPHONES. SURPERIOR SOUND WITH NO NOISE
R2IWNMD3BVFIDW,5,"There are so many reviews here that I will limit my comments. I just want to add to the others how superb these headphones sound. I've been unhappy with wireless headphones I've had in the past with the amount of inner detail they proved as well as their ability to hold a charge. These do an excellent job on both counts.<br /><br />I've had over my lifetime a love-hate relationship with Sennheiser. I bought my first set of Sennheisers in 1975, just after the company first opened for business. Probably my all time favorite headphones. More recent headphones have better sound, but those were my principle headphones for 30 years. In the past 15 years I've tended to use earphones more than headphones, and Sennheisier makes horrible earphones in the price range I can afford. I've also been disappointed with some of Sennnheiser's budget headphones (bought to serve as backups). But I've also had some outstanding headphones. These fall into that category. They definitely have helped rebuild some of the trust that was lost using some inferior products."
R3HGZ9JIBIG1WQ,4,Excellent quality but a little heavy and tends to slide off the head when head is tilted.
R1G24ID7W859L3,5,Gift for dad..moms finally able to sleep
R1OFF62LM79YXI,5,"My husband uses this everyday, he is 80 and the hearing is fading.  I can enjoy controlling the sound with my remote and he controls his .  It's great."
RKVEHUNJXCS43,5,"This is an excellent product at a great price.  I've owned these before, though a different brand.  These headphones are comfortable to wear, easy to set up, and it's easy to tune in.  Wow!  I didn't have to retune the channel just because I left the room.The sound is clear, and the headphones are easy on the ears.  I would buy this again in a flash...and think Amazon customers would be happy with this product."
R29IREY3WKXYNG,5,"I love these headphones. I use them all the time. One of the best purchases  I have ever made. They are great. Sound and convenience. I just read on here that if you forget to recharge that you can put in a couple AAA batteries instead. Haven't tried it yet but I'm very happy to hear that.  After about 4 years of daily/hard use my battery pack is starting to fade a little. Not lasting as long. Which is fair considering how much I use them . I just ordered some new rechargeable batteries. If i have a problem with them I will report back. If not,  then all is well. YeS, I would recommend to a friend. Very happy with them! Great sound and after 4 years still in great shape. :)"
R2BZVPT1ZOLMG7,5,Wonderful sound comfortable to wear! I'm actually watching TV again.i should say I'm hearing the television and understanding every word.
R1X5K7EVZOM33Y,5,Comfortable.  Easy to change batteries
R1SU62L2QY77HC,5,prompt delivery. product as advertised. I recommend. happy with product.
R1N2BONKW521PA,3,They are working fine so far.
R5OFHP129I4C2,2,were only so-so.  sold item
R3DX36KQHTYUAY,5,I was tired of missing dialog on tv programs but these cured that problem
R163KWE6JWD8D,2,you can..not keep these on your head
R3NOY8Y3YJ1XK6,2,loses signal often. Not worth the effort to use
R17JTK4V403VYP,4,"I would give this a 5 star if the RCA plugs worked on my TV - but they don't.<br /><br />I also noticed that for those who also have a Samsung TV, my problem isn't unique.<br /><br />I bought this for my kitchen TV so that I could listen/watch programs that would normally annoy my wife, while making dinner. During dinner, I would then take the head phones off and switch to programming that we both would watch.<br /><br />My intention was to plug the Red & White RCA plugs directly into the L/R audio out on the back of my TV (Samsung) so that all I would have to do is mute the set and still have output sound feeding the transmitter... but after that didn't work, I used the supplied RCA-Audio plug and it fired up. The only downside is that when I want to listen to the audio from the TV, I need to unplug the adapter.<br /><br />The upside is that the sound quality is surprisingly very good and the range is also very good. The unintended benefit is that I can still hear my program while going outside to grill, etc. So this is a keeper... My wife is also happier because she doesn't need to hear the TV while she's reading in the other room... WIN!"
R2CF1FSOFFJ5CE,5,"My husband has a hard time hearing the TV when there is a lot of noise, grand kids, he really enjoys using these Headphones.  Comfortable and easy to use."
RV7WM3JVUNRQK,4,"Sound is excellent and range is very good. I am able to roam around the house without any degradation in reception. I enjoy just listening to television with the headphones. They are very comfortable. I have even fallen asleep while listening with the head phones.<br /><br />My one negative is in one of my installations, as I brought two, I am picking up a routine cracle. I know that it is something in the environment, as I have a similar routine cracle on my cordless phone. I only detect it at low volume, so its not a major problem."
R190UT5DR1MY8B,5,"Great product. Works so well that we have two of these, one for my wife and one for me."
RZ4EVH3A3VZVF,5,Looks nice. Just got new TV for it so I cant tell how it acts. If its like previous Previous Sennheiser products it ought to be great. I have an older version of these and they charge great. These? Well they are a totally different process with c batteries so I will have to wait and see.
R31NXLCFEZ9V6R,5,This is my 3rd Sennheiser sound system and I still love them. I'm hard of hearing and need to turn the sound loud to understand the dialog on TV. I've had the RS110 that I eventually replaced with a TS180 that has been in service for 4 years. I use the 180 system in place of a sound bar on my 60&#34; TV. as no one else in my family really cares to listen to a loud TV.  I purchased this RS120 for my bedroom TV so the sound doesn't disturb my wife.  My only criticism is that this model is &#34;on the ear&#34; and not &#34;over the ear&#34; design.
RP8BXDKP8Z0ND,3,Good if your going to remain in the same room or an adjoining one.
R2E8YNBK35F61B,1,"These were very easy to set up, and they work well. Great sound.<br />But the speakers do not have cushions that envelope the entire ear. Instead, the ear pads sit directly on the ears. There is too much tension in the headband, thus causing aches to my ears after approximately one hour. These are extremely uncomfortable, therefore the low rating."
RGJ5R9VATW2M0,5,"Comfortable, speech easily understood, even foreign accents.  Strong clear signal all around the house.<br />Easy-to-reach volume control.  Replaceable batteries.  Expect it will last forever."
R33WROJJL86VIE,5,easy to hook up to TV sounds  great .
R39E1L8W3LLOOV,5,Saving my marriage
R3LB29MS5VJAWT,5,These headphones were the solution to an ongoing problem between my husband and the rest of the family.  He has reduced hearing in his right ear and compensates by turning up the volume on the TV.  This was fine for him but was very disturbing for the rest of us.  These headphones allow him to turn up  the volume to a level necessary for him to hear without turning up the volume on the TV.  Now we can all enjoy watching TV without anyone complaining.  An added plus is that they are wireless so he can move around easily while still listening to a show.
RIN9R557VUWIT,2,Work for five minutes then all you here is stactic.<br />Not a happy camper!!
R38TG1Y9KFO7I,5,Very very good
R4WN5137J2R9G,5,As good as it get!
R1MV370IC646BI,5,this is one of the best wireless headphone I ever owned. I have it over two years and do not have any problem. i work electronic retail store and recommended to anyone who ever ask about head phone.
RHFLNOAKJFT9K,5,good
RCP43TS80BQON,4,Great product
R25T0V4DJWGLVH,5,These work great and are comfortable to wear.
R1ZGPMXY9PPEX3,5,"Works great, would buy again"
RKVT8NQ9ZOWX5,5,"This is a true quality product. The delivered sound has a crisp treble and base for any HD or regular TV viewing. There are three settings for frequency change on the base and 99% of the time, There is Absolutely no interference. Have been using this product for over two years.<br /><br />One important to notate, be sure that the volume level setting for the TV is loud. Then you can control the volume on your headset. Otherwise, it will loose the connection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED To have for those late night TV viewing with consideration of others early riser."
R39XC72DJQ17C8,5,A must around our house. We have two sets. One for the living room and one for the bedroom. Great quality sound
R2HCKPFSBWHUNZ,5,Love this product! We use it every night and bought a second pair of headphones
R1YUMC2XEU0LTI,1,Way to big for my head.  Couldn't even move without them slipping off.  Ended up spending more money but got a pair that works great.
R37BX3MIX1PVIM,5,Keeps me from hearing the loud talk on ESPN
R3MHHTV143N7PT,5,First was a dud but your rapid replacement works fine
R111DHH2K9KJFO,4,very good
R2CLFFHO4DBGES,5,All products with great quality and has been very well used by me.
R23AESD7311GGO,5,I could not be more satisfied with these headphones.  Not only does it prevent my TV viewing from bothering the rest of the household but it also blocks the rest of the household out so they don't bother me.  They are very comfortable and if you forget to charge them you can use two AAA batteries which last for quite a while.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I am able to hear things through these that I've never heard through my television speakers before.  The entire experience is improved immensely.
R1NQOTIITEMXAP,5,"after trying a different headset brand first, I can really appreciate this sennheiser headset!  as a matter of fact, these were recommended to me!  and they really do have great sound ... and the fit is great, too.  the other brand (rca) I bought kept trying to fall off my head, plus it sounded as though there was an electrical short that I couldn't get rid of no matter what channel adjustment I made.  with the sennheiser set, the only time I get any interference is when I go too far into the kitchen (the base is in the bedroom) or try to do anything at the kitchen sink with the water running ... pipes or water?  fridge interference?  at any rate, all I have to do is adjust these a little or even just turn my head slightly.  sometimes I turn my TV's to a good concert and put the sennheisers on, and I can go anywhere in my home and hear great sound.  none of the other electronics I have seem to interfere with the sennheiser's reception (except for the kitchen sink, that is).  so, thank you amazon and amazon tech department for recommending these to me!"
R9SWJNYTCTOKZ,5,these are wonderful  have two pair that are used constantly. Liven in condo where quietness is necessary and just not having to b concerned about the TV being too lo iis a great worry off my mind.
R2NJPKFCL2A6JQ,5,"Excellent product!  Works exactly as described.  As someone who has trouble hearing conversations on TV/DVDs when there is moderate to high background noise, these headphones have proven to be my solution to this hearing impediment."
R2CKX371NPQPCQ,3,"These work fine except for the static I get when there's no noise for a couple of minutes.  I use these on my computer, in the morning, when my family is asleep.  The only problem I've had is the static they play when there's no sound for a couple of minutes.  This can be quite often if I'm just surfing the web.  I've taken to playing music to avoid this, but it kind of sucks to be forced to do that.  I would give these 5 stars if it wasn't for the issue with static playing when no noise."
R3TOHXCQIJRQXR,5,"Just as described, arrived on time, great product"
RK6NCCT4RJZMT,5,Excellent.
R3JPLQUIAD6L9R,5,"Comfortable fit, exellent sound, transmit without any problem."
R38OQ0TQKDL49,5,Product works great. Thank you. I
R2I4AN8YDR7JRW,3,"So far so good. We've had these for a month or so. They have performed well. Mom is hard of hearing and I'm not, we can watch the same shows at our own volume levels. Very nice. The sound quality is excellent.  Worked well enough for a year, but now having tuning problems with one pair and the other has a rattle indicating something loose inside. Since we already have the base and they worked well for a year, I'm going to replace with the same things. I am disappointed with the length of service though so I'm downgrading my review from 4 to 3 stars."
RW1WMDLNFILQ8,5,Got this for my wife to replace a Sony unit.  She enjoys that you can walk around with out losing the sound. Her one concern is the unit can feel heavy after a few hours of use.
RXWLBVCOIX0UT,5,Great sound and works well all around the house.... it doesn't have to be within line of sight of the transmitter!
R1J64GVIHUEJCH,5,Works great. Install was easy. Very good product!
R2OOZETNY98N35,5,"Great headset, great range, sounds good. Only issues I have is it fits loose on the head. Will falloff when looking down at floor. I have had Sony before and this headset is much better."
R1F0C1TEA2BJPY,5,Clear sound.  Can walk around with it and continue to hear the TV show in another room.
R19MJI7P3KEXCU,5,Nothing else to add.
R2GSY0K42YOVU8,5,Fantastic headphones.  Both my husband and I each have these headphones so I can listen to the TV while working in the kitchen and he and the TV are in another room. I had a pair from Sony that were unsatisfactory in every way and were replaced with Sennheiser's.<br />My newest Sennheiser's were purchased as a refurbished set and are excellent. The itemized &#34;Features&#34; are correct although the range of transmission is far greater than 100 meters. A minor weakness I've experienced is that I've had to add a band to them that goes around the back of my head so they don't fall off when I lean over or move about too fast.
RGHJD3Q231MJH,5,"Excellent headphones. I'm able to watch TV and/or dvd's without disturbing anyone in or near the room. Very good sound too,"
R3QSGEDO170FFD,4,"This is a better set up than TV ears , here is why. Uses AAA batteries , lighter ,  doesn't hang around your neck like a cow bell, and is adjustable. Sound is very good . Wife and I run the volume up to 55 to 60 , with these we can turn them on low and hear fine . Only reason not given a five is the ear piece cover comes off too easy , have to be careful . On my set you can hook up and still run TV volume if you want."
R1MXUVV3RS1BI3,5,What a great gift to give to friends and family love it
R2HWXPF9VW7NYH,4,"This unit really works. Some things to be aware of. The green power light only comes on when the audio source is active, but stays on a while after that source is turned off. It's a bit confusing but perfectly normal. I bought this for my hard of hearing 93 year old mother who refuses to get a hearing aide so she could hear her TV better. The other issue with the phones is the &#34;tuning&#34; knob which is located next to the volume control knob. She couldn't distinguish the difference so I applied black electrical tape over it and solved the problem."
R3DR1DHDYJC9P2,5,"These are the best things to happen to TV (that's where we use ours) since digital and HD TVs replaced the old kind! I am  hard of hearing, and my headphones make it possible for me to hear and understand dialog because the sound is so clear. Whereas before I was getting maybe 1 out of 5 words, now I get about 9 out of 10. HUGE difference."
RYO0HVQELP3WW,5,"Great headphones! We purchased the headphones for our mother who has experienced sudden hearing loss and was struggling to hear the television. They work wonderfully for her. She is able to hear programs without turning the volume up and doesn't miss any of the dialogue. They connect easily and have wonderful sound quality with no interference. They work so well that we purchased a second unit for her upstairs television. I tried them and liked them so much I plan to purchase a set for myself. As I mentioned previously, the sound is great and if one is working in the kitchen or even cleaning around the house these headphones are convenient while moving about while staying connected with music, news programs or whatever."
R1JAFA95KADXBP,5,I bought this as a gift and my dad loves it.
R38V2UGXD4G2C7,5,"These are amazing! I've had them for about a month. I use them when my husband goes to bed and I'm still watching TV. They have a nice bass sound to them. You can hear things like footsteps, leaves blowing...little sounds that you can't hear listening to regular TV speakers. I have never run out of a charge...so they last pretty long while you're using them. The headphones have their own volume control, so you can use them along with the tv volume turned up or with the TV volume all the way down. You can even mute the TV and control the headphone volume independently. They were very easy to set up..plug and play! I am very happy with these!"
R3TUPL6V18ZR0H,3,"the headphones are very uncomfortabe,"
R3Q41WG51QXR16,5,Great product!!  I can now understand the dialogue on TV without raising the volume to a level that annoys my wife.  Every husband should have this device.
R26DHC7E8XBOQE,5,I bought this for my 87 year old neighbor.  He has fis TV almost maxed out trying to hear the TV.  Now he can watch TV and his wife doesn't have to leave the room because the volume is so high on the TV.  It's a winner for both of them.
R3TCLE9DILFFO1,4,Work well but are big.
RZITJROEAHJSS,5,the sound is unbelievably good for the money
RSSMELD0ID2FP,5,Plug n play.  I use them to watch TV in my bedroom while wife is asleep.   I mute sound on TV so it doesn't bother wife. Work great need I say more.
RTSYYZFX5DHF2,5,worked just fine and lasted a long time.  Well worth the money.
R812CHITU8S8H,4,ok
RWZNQA0TQZQPW,5,Works well so I don't disturb the family at night.  Like that it has replaceable batteries.
R22OG5BA48404A,5,"Every now and again you find a product that makes you wonder how you lived without it. This is definitely one of those. I live in a condo with walls made of cardboard. I can hear my neighbor sneezing downstairs! I enjoy watching/listening to rock concerts on DVD but I've always had to keep the sound and bass down.... especially on a summer night when I like to keep the doors and windows open. I don't have to worry about that anymore. Now, I am by no means an audiophile. I would probably be happy listening to music in a tin can so I am not touting this as the finest apparatus if you are used to listening to music on a $10,000 state of the art stereo system. This is for listening to sounds you would normally hear on a TV without bothering the neighbors. But I can hear instruments and voices on the headphones more clearly than I have been able to with the volume on the TV turned down. I guess I am getting to be a little hard of hearing and often watch TV shows with subtitles so I can catch every word. With the earphones I'm also able to hear the soundtrack on TV shows more clearly than without them and I don't need the subtitles as much. I wander all over the house, upstairs and downstairs with no problems. Oh, and they are incredibly comfortable... I don't even know I am wearing them which is highly unusual for me. I give these headphones six stars!"
R2IFK13315TH4X,2,"COULDN'T GET THEM TO WORK, HAD TO SEND THEM BACK."
RXKKJF1QKA0LV,5,headphones are great I can hear the TV in my bedroom without disturbing my wife.
R2LYSHVY4TAMGW,5,I PURCHASED THIS HEADSET FOR MYSELF  BECAUSE I  AM HARD OF HEARING. HAD TO TURN UP VOLUME ON TV WHEN AIR CONDITIONING CAME ON. WELL BUILT UNIT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO PERSON HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING THERE TV.. ALSO YOU CAN HEAR SOMEBODY TALKING TO YOU WHILE YOUR WATCHING TV. GREAT BUY!!!
R4HM1MIPN5BOI,5,"Wish I knew about this headset before going through two others in less than a year.  Very comfortable.  Does not fall off my head like others have complained, but if your head is small, well.....  Holds a charge really well and no static at 20 feet.  Does not lose signal, even with the base hiding behind a wall"
R38TY2BZLL045H,3,"Nice device.  No longer have a cord trailing across my living room.<br /><br />Range is not great.  I sit 10-15ft away from the receiver and I get static if my head is turned the wrong way.  Not terrible, but enough to notice and feel the need to cock my head at a weird angle.<br /><br />In defense of the item my speakers are relatively nearby and might be causing interference."
R23JPEWWU6TSMK,5,They took awhile to get used to but for the price and how they sound this is an excellent buy
R3JYKX2NVM19SC,4,"Works well right out of the box, have not had any issues with it whatsoever."
R2BS7Y3Q615SXA,5,This works great on our TV for late night viewing making the house quiet for the other people sleeping. It took me a few minutes to figure out the adjustments to eliminate the static.  I can walk around the house and still hear the TV and the headset if pretty comfortable.
R12WQ14MT8Z6SI,5,"Great headphones,price and quick shipment with good communications,thank you"
R2GSMUW8RL8NXY,3,good but every now and then looses what your tuned to when this happens loud static scares the heck out of me
R1UQMGCEWK9AF7,5,"woks great, easy to set up & ability to mute my Vizio TV"
R2P36X74V2R853,5,"It's comfortable to wear. It's got great sound quality. It transmits long distances even through walls. For the money, you really can't beat this headset for listening to television wirelessly."
RW7AJPJPR43WC,1,"I returned this item because I could not get it to work, regardless of how very closely I followed the directions.  Also, the headset just does not stay on your head!"
R37EF0NA30DU4L,1,"Very dissatisfied with this product. Installed batteries and connected to tv, was never able to tune headphones for clear clean sound at any distance. The second day headphones failed completely. Definitely not Sennheisr quality, which is what thought I had purchased based on previous Sennheisr products. Avoid this item."
RUPGHI19ZAT0E,5,These are awesome.... these exceeded my expectations.  I use em with my home theater system so I can watch a movie late at night and not keep anyone else awake
R2MPWKX3JZC0IV,3,"Good Sound--but echo's if source is also playing--if source volume is turned off then no echo.  Does poor job in cancelling surrounding sound.  Overall, nice charging stand and comfortable to wear."
RLQB3X17A0AUX,5,They are awesome -thanks
RSB9TQ4N7987P,5,"A great device if you're living in an RV and your spouse doesn't like listening to the news when you do--or she like &#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; and you don/t.  Sound clarity is excellent, as is the range--if you like listening to the bad news when you're in the basement workshop and the TV is upstairs."
R3TTOCBUKAR2DH,5,"best quality of sound, long range, easy to install and arrive on time."
R3LB0SS8QA9SI8,3,"After extensive research,i decided to try these out in my home studio for music recording and mixing.  I had already tried the comparable Sony with no success. I tried all the settings and some of them are ok, but there was no way to eliminate all the background hiss, bleeps and blips. Reverting back to wired headphones for my recording needs."
R32J0XUILEN15S,2,"We got way too much static on the headphones. We tried getting closer to the base, and moved around the room, but couldn't get a clear signal. We returned them."
R364NPHEE4DFYG,5,I have two of these. Love them.
R3K25YI1PJLTVN,5,"Awesome deal on used ones from Amazon they where like new with all accessories for less than half the price. Got two for my parents since they don't hear that good anymore, and they love it, they don't need audiophile quality, just something that works and sounds OK. Not recommended for long periods of use after more that 5hr your ears will hurt says my mom but she loves them lol."
RHGNUYI193QHF,5,Excellent quality.  Very well made and comfortable.  Easy to set up as well.
R1N5CXLXR7PN6D,5,Easy setup comfortable and clear
R26VMJI0IGJV21,4,Item was a gift to someone else. Feedback was positive.
R1XFFLB6BO0ZSL,5,"It took me a few tries to get it to work, but the online comments really helped. Right now I am listening to a morning news show upstairs in my house, while the t.v. is downstairs. I can walk all over the house, and outside to the yard or garage, with clear audio. The only thing that bothers me is that the headphone makes my head hurt where it presses the earpiece of my glasses into my head. It is nice to be able to have the t.v. turned down low and still hear. I can also still hear things going on around me (my dog barking, or a knock on the door), which is good."
RKBJY0DW0563Z,5,"Bought a third pair as a gift for my father-in-law. First one was for my mom. Even though I don't have hearing problem I still bought one for myself. Works great when there is too much noise (dishwasher, laundry, kids running, lawn mower, etc.) around and you want to pay attention to conversations in the movie."
R1XE9JNY2PP6D2,2,"I have been using these headphones for over a year now and I don't think they are that wonderful. They are very wide and so easily slip from my head when I want to recline and relax to watch something. I've had to put the head band on my forehead of I want to lie down... Quite annoying really. And now to the charging system... I thought it was brilliant when I never really turned my computer off. You see, you'd think that the &#34;charging stand&#34; is all the headphones need to charge up. Wrong. The charging stand needs to be connected not just to the power plug, but to a device that is on, to charge the headphones properly. Woe be me that now I want to watch my bills and be more frugal with electricity use... Since experimenting with actually turning my computer off more diligently, the headphones don't charge properly. You know it hasn't charged properly when the sound starts to break up with a lot of high pitch static. What a disappointment. Why do wireless headphones need to be so complicated? I have to say, when they are working, the sound is great, but it's dodgy charging system, and the lack of product hold on one's head (I can just see someone trying to do their dishes with these, look downwards and these bad boys slip straight into the dish water... Bad times), makes it a no no for a recommendation. P.s. I don't have a small head, in fact, mine is wider than average."
R1RAE7OSQH5O6E,5,Sound is great and nice to be able to hear it through walls when I walk away and not to hVe to change the batteries because of the charging cradle. Excellent!
R2HZ14CSIOO7CE,4,"I like this product ok.  There are a couple of things that should have been considered in the design perhaps.  I 'installed' it on our Samsung 55&#34; HD TV.  The only problem is that I had to disconnect my Bose Cinnemate from the back of the TV in order to use these headphones.  This is not the fault of the Sennheiser but one of TV.  There should be two audio input areas on the TV but there aren't.  I purchased these at the strong recommendation of a friend who said it will be a life-saver and especially for those women whose husbands just have to have the TV sound as loud as possible in order to hear and enjoy the program they happen to be watching.  She was correct, it has been a life and sanity saver as now the house is nice and quiet while certain programming is being viewed that I do not wish to sit and watch.  The main issue I have with these headphones is the lack of a longer audio cord/cable that connects from the TV to the charging cradle along with the power cord too.  In my opinion, these two cords need to be considerably longer to reach outlets, etc.  The instructions say not to place the charging cradle too close to metal objects.  That creates the challenge.  As far as the sound of these headphones, my husband is happy as he claims he can now hear TV audio much clearer than before when he was just listening thru the TV's speakers.  For me, the sound is not all that rich but maybe I am just a little spoiled as I like to listen thru/using the Bose Cinnemate system.  I will have to have an audio person come to the house to see if they can find a place of harmony so that both sound products can co-exist with our particular TV.  Other than that, we are happy with this purchase and hope they last a very long time.  We waited quite a while until they came down in price and feel the value is decent for the product we purchased.  As for the manufacturers, they need to consider making the two cables longer so the charging cradle/cradles can be place in more convenient places (at least in our case).venient places (at least in our case)."
R20YAU5DE6X9VT,3,"It's ok, but it has some noise or static. It's not crystal clear sound. I recommend it for people who wanna stay under $100 budget."
R30RS9PA2N8PLE,4,It would get 5 stars but the volume can be heard even with medium setting and it wakes my 1 year old. They should design it with a more compressed headset so the sound doesn't leak out
R36CT0RO2Q4WQ3,4,Good sound and would buy again!
RRJJS5I4E1NJ,5,"Only thing is that when there is a power outage you must unplug the ac and then reconnect to regain audio.  Good range, low distortion, almost comfortable.  Good buy"
R2V0338VZSRU6N,4,"As a new owner I have had only a few hours enjoying these headphones. First I will give you my pro list followed by my con list and finish with my overall opinion.<br />Pros: The range of these is great I have walked all over my house and yard without going out of range, only a couple of times did I get any hiss or static.<br />I have not ran out of battery power yet and I am not using the charger other then to fully charge them once. So far I have used them over 5 hrs no sign of running out of power at all.<br />Sound is good not great but decent.<br />I would recommend to a friend without any reservations<br /><br />Cons: These fall off your head very easily, if you use these in your yard and bend down they will fall off.<br />The charger does't allow you to turn off the charging mode so you have to put them down unless you wish to create a memory problem with the rechargeable batteries.<br />Sound doesn't have the bass that I have read often in the reviews. An average ear bud has a lot more bass then these. My old AKG's have better sound overall and they are over 25 yrs old.<br />Charge light does not go off or change to let you know they are charged<br />I really would love it if they put a switch on the cradle so you don't always charge when you don't wan't to.<br /><br />Overall: Good product for the money as I have had a wireless headphones before which seemed very good but had so much noise that I couldn't stand them. T<br />These have no problems with the transmitter at all. The range is great and the overall sound is good enough for most people.<br />Don't get me wrong about the bass it's there, just not as prominent as I expected. I love deep bass so for me it's slightly low.<br /><br />One more item is Amazon has this exact pair of headphones for two different prices with over a hundred dollar difference so beware."
R2D2ZE2HO7LMFK,5,I have a couple of those and they are very reliable. I will always replace them with this brand if they ever broke. This is quality stuff.
R2GI0H1PI7NGD8,5,Great set of phones. I already bought an extra one for the other tv!
R22ODUX7N7Z8NY,5,My mom had a hearing problem. My dad liked to sleep early. I mounted a big TV in their bedroom. This model worked the best. I tried a cheaper one a regretted it.  This had good sound quality and simple to use.
R7I99UE49YCCO,5,Great option and clarity! I work from my home office and this allows the wife to enjoy her shows without interruption. We have wood throughout the house and sound quickly travels.  I am loyal to this brand because of the value with corresponding quality.
R1TTI24XMLVQ3W,5,"Great item.  Does as advertised.  My wife loves it because the tv does not need to be blasting.  She can put the television volume  where she likes (usually mute), and I can have the headphone volume where I can hear it."
R3EYV0SWI9H1DL,5,"Just love this gift I purchased for my husband-But it's really for me! I can enjoy the peace and quiet while he recovers from a surgery -my husband loves the headphones - they are light, the sound is crystal clear- Bonus, is I hear no background noise!"
R2U3IXCDDJ3YG,5,My husband uses these so we do not have to keep the TV so loud.
R1AZW1D2Y7LJRL,4,It isgreattohear the words clearly. It is heavy on the top of my head so I have to remove it occasionally but I am very happy I got it
RIEWGPRYK89AP,3,"Im unable to know how to use it with TV. I need guidance plz. Its working with my laptop but not tv, also it only works when the tarnsmitter charger is plugged to power .. Otherwise it will produce a nuisance sound. then whats the benefit of buying a wireless when transmitter has to b with power all time??<br />Also whats the use of adapter node given in the box??<br />& how long it takes for charging?? WHats the sign to know that niMH batteries r fully charged?? What does on/off green light & red charge light mean??<br />& when do we have to buy new rechargeable batteries?How long are these existing ones gonna work.??<br />PLease any user, guide me im ao anxious to start using them. THANKS !!"
R23XMKKRE9WSLN,5,excelente
RTUEQY3C17AEO,3,"If you can not endure the noise caused by wireless transmission, you'd better give up as me."
R3AZST0QC62Z5E,5,Headphones are durable and not at all flimsy.  The are easily charged on the cradle without having to be precise in the placement of the headphones.  Hearing quality has been very good. My hearing is terrible but I can now listen to tv without blowing everyone else out of the room. My spouse loves it!!!!
R3EJZSDLUPNWAR,4,Great sound!
R2LL7PBNENXIRQ,2,Complicated tuning dial.
RRGDL25ZTDXFS,4,This set up works just fine after I figured out how to hook it up properly. RCN a/k/a Sparkplug
R3C44TVAB44PQM,3,"For the price, it is a good buy. The only issue I had with it is the fact that sometimes the audio just turns to pure static and you pretty much have to rip them off your head as not to go deaf. The static is very loud, as well.<br /><br />They are comfortable, and I use them regularly. I use them as a monitor while recording music, and they seem to be great for that."
R1ALPIX87DPLWH,4,slow delivery but good product!
R36ODXMY273JNM,3,"The sound is great and the adjustments for tuning are good, the one fault that I have is the adjustment of the earphones, they do not fit tight enough the ears and tend to move when the head leans forward."
RXWNMJLI7SES4,4,"The phones are very good quality and perform quite well.  Note that the cradle/charger must be located close to the TV, not by the bed side as I expected, but they are great."
R167E0PND98VFJ,5,"After a couple years it still works extremely well for me.  I use them for listening to TV in bed without disturbing the wife, so I can't judge the fidelity for music.  I am able to walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and still hear but much farther than that 30-ish feet and I lose reception.  They don't hold tight to my head so if I bend over they will slip off - no biggie.<br /><br />What I really want is a low profile pair that easily allows me to sleep on my side and still listen in bed, but I can't hold that against them."
R3T3C2S78PU1RQ,5,Great!
R2PDM1L535VIRC,1,"Unfortunately, I had to return these headphones. They're very easy to set up for TV viewing, yet, these did not work...I may have received a lemon. Never had a problem with the Sony wireless headphones, so will likely purchase those again."
R2B76WE5CZIGG5,4,"Product is wonderful.  Now, if we can only get the recipient to WEAR the headphones.  ugh!"
R1BTZA37KWQAJM,5,Love this!  Gave them to my husband for a birthday gift as he is a night owl and loves to play the TV loudly during the night. He can even walk around the house and still hear what is happening on the TV.
R3KD0TNYV7UCLA,2,You know when your next to someone and they're headphones are at full volume because you can hear it clearly as well?  Thats what you have with these.
RMPR1WAGWYZSK,3,"The charging method is great - the wire cradle that holds the headphones is the charging system.<br /><br />The headphones are comfortable to wear.  They are not the sound proof style - they do not have the ear indention that engulfs the ear.  Instead, the soft foam is flat and rests against my ears which allows air flow.<br /><br />They work best if I are not moving my head a lot.  They fall off very easily if I quickly look down and from other head movements.<br /><br />The sound quality is certainly adequate for my use.  I am listening to digital music from a computer.<br /><br />The controls are the weak point of this product.  The on/off switch does not work very well.  I sometimes have to jostle the headphones after I turn them on to get them to play.  Sometimes while I am listening to music, the sound stops and if I take off the headphones and give the on/off switch a swift dope slap, the music comes back on.<br /><br />The volume knob and the frequency tuning knob are located together on the left earphone and are identical in shape and size.  It takes a while to memorize which is which.  The volume knob is obviously very useful.  The frequency tuning knob is needed a few times in the lifespan of the product.  If no sound is coming from the earphones, an incorrect choice of those knobs only complicates the situation.<br /><br />For the money, I believe this is a good product.  With only minor modifications to the controls, this could easily be an exceptionally good product."
R2SLQUKPGQTHXS,5,"Six years later, still work great but with left side audio gone. But grandsons over those years may have tampered/dropped it too often. Will be buying a new set, or two."
R3A2UNJ9067B11,5,"The audio quality is crisp and clean. I would recommend Sennheiser RF Headphones to anyone.<br /><br />When you're doing the original setup, if you can't get them to work with your television, try using the L/R audio jacks on the back of your DVR. Then it should work for you."
R3MRR05SAFSKYR,5,Have 2 of these.  Quality with long lasting battery system.  Only negative is the headset seems to be a bit wide for normal sized heads.
RYNPM469VE60Q,3,"They are easy to use, but I get a lot of interference from other things. Also, when plugged into my TV they have an automatic shut off if they don't think they hear any sound after 10-15 minutes then you have to turn them off and back on again. The workaround is to plug them into your TV and then crank the volume to max, this works sometimes. Just don't forget to turn it back down when you unplug them...."
R3R86AN24O7ERQ,5,"Best buy I ever made..........comfortable, sound is in stereo and now I enjoy watching TV"
R1O7ABG0BPCK6L,5,I have no complaints about these headphones. I bought an extra headset and was surprised to find out you can listen with one while the second set charges. All other sets that I've owned the sender shuts off when charging
RV2FRU4DUK3RJ,3,"Everything is great except the ability to stay on my head.<br />The foam covers are comfortable but have no pressure and the headsets fall of, if do not stand up straight.<br />I see no way to adjust them. I do not have a small head."
RBV713XT84ZXW,1,sent it back..made to hook to a stereo system with instructions that are so difficult you have to be a sound engineer
R69QSCNEY7BIR,1,They barely lasted 3months before they failed...$100. wasted
RP1LC5ESJFQ1,3,"A manual was not included, which is making it difficult to connect"
R1RFMRU5XNM74C,4,"very good. easy to connect. very little static is coming. Many people posted about fit. I am an average Asian, so my head size is just normal. It does fit very nicely. The only issue I have is: it connected nicely with my smart TV (samsung), but did not connect to the non-smart Vizio TV, which I have connected using a Samsung box (part of a Samsung home theater system with wifi). I am unable to connect it to that."
R3NWDS8VH4D17Z,5,Bought for my husband  so I didn't have to have TV loud.  It is wonderful. Now people 3 doors down don't hear our TV
RH1D13WKUBNG5,5,"I can listen to whatever I select on my HD receiver (TV, Radio, Music, etc.) perfectly throughout the house. I even wore them mowing the lawn and they worked with very little static (lawn mower too loud, but they worked 200 feet from house!) Rotate a pair of good rechargeable AAA batteries in the headset (like eneloop.) The ONLY mild complaint is they sometimes slide off my head when I'm climbing latters, bending over, etc. I need to get some sort of retainer band as they work so well I wear them all the time while working around the house."
R3AKF6WPCKKS7O,3,"Still trying to figure out how to make them work with my television. I have two new televisions with perfect out ports but it doesn't work on either, I have tried everything and have spent a lot of time online trying to figure out WHY! But they work perfectly when I plug them in to my cell phone...but unfortunately that's not why I bought them. I will try calling the company but if they can't help I will have to send them back."
R1ZWPFZKIXR0W6,4,"Worked fine for a couple of years, but now the volume is a little messed up.  If not adjusted just right, there's a buzzing sound."
R2UDF7VAJRWM92,2,They fall off your head way to easy when cruising the house. Over the ear would be best.
R2DJPZ1PS2YJYH,5,Good quality and sound. Nice controls and comfortable fit. No static and has good reception through-out house and out into the yard.
R3PY69Z3KUKMEU,5,"I lost a lot of my hearing in the Viet Nam War(2 times-had so much fun I went back for seconds!)  Hand Grenade thrown by Viet Cong, so I need TV volume louder than my spouse and this unit fills the bill.  I can have my sound louder and it does not disturb my wife.  Liked the unit so much I purchased a second unit for use in my room when I watch TV late at night while my wife is asleep.  (I require only 5 hours of sleep as oppossed to my wife's 8.  :)"
R1JZQES6D1BYJP,3,"These headphones are terrific.  They just have two major problems.  First, they fall off of your head.  If your tilt your head forward or backward, they fall off.  Second, the ear piece covers constantly fall off.  Sound quality is great.  Recharging is great.  Volume control is fine.  Range is fine.  Everything about these headphones is fine if you can keep them on your head."
R1VDBDIW35263L,4,"I did a lot of research before buying these and found these to be the best for the money. For great sound quality I had to go with RF not Bluetooth and I am glad I did. Night and day, seriously. The frequency adjust knob is great in a house full of other devices in this frequency range and I can always find a crisp and clear channel while watching up to 15 ft away. Very comfortable for watching hours long movies or playing video games late night without disturbing the wife/kids. I have had these for over a year, trouble free. This brand is also world class.<br /><br />My only issue is the form factor: I needed a firmer pillow so when laying down they would stay on my head better. A definite first world problem and only worth one star."
R10F56O5BO6BOC,5,Very Good
R1YI3CU3PJN55R,4,"Great sound for the price,but it does tend to fall off when you bend over.  Also you can't hear what others in the room are saying."
RC162JWVIU392,5,Why didn't I buy this sooner?  Love it.
R3J2ML81HXCPAR,4,I brought refurbished product. I didn't received the original box but the headphones and charging cradle are look new.  set up is very easy and it working great till now.
R1E4FPWEZUWQG8,5,"These headphones are amazing, I was kind of disappointed that my TV, my expensive high definition plasma TV did not have a input port for them, but I was able to use them on my other TV instead. The sounds great,even when I remove room to room. These headphones are great because I don't have to be in a line of sight for them to work. Best money I've ever spent."
R2O2FPFMT2Y2WZ,5,"very nice, light weighted over your head and sound quality is too good."
R2OT6NEGXNGNOC,4,After a few years they stopped holding a charge.
R3QZ56NBUHB1SA,5,"This is the most awesome purchase yet!!! These ear phones allow me to hear things while watching my TV that I never ever thought possible; car motors, PA systems on my cop shows and many many more. I love the rechargeable batteries and how simple it is to charge the ear phones. Also, the range is unbelievable. I can leave my apartment and go to the laundry room and still hear just fine. This unit is ideal for apartments and for those who want to listen to their TV is absolute stereo without disturbing the neighbors. It's great because you can actually turn the sound off on the set completely."
R8DF6LK5UMR2U,5,"I really like these. Comfortable, adjustments on one ear are easy to access.  Good range.  I actually own 2 sets.<br />2 points to make here- you will have to replace the initial rechargable batteries that come with it.  no big deal, pick up a couple a most any store.<br />AS I said I own 2 units.  I sometimes find I cant leave them both plugged in to power without picking up the signal from one unit on the other one.  If you need 2 units, I recommend either being ready to unplug one when not in use, or find one on a different frequency.<br />I'm still giving them 5 stars, but it would be nice if there was a way to adjust the frequency of their output."
R1V5651R3HLNEA,4,"Easy setup, easy to use, accurate tuning, great sound. I just wish the headset and the charging base were a little more compact. Great value though."
RBZT6DE66TKHK,3,I have never been able to get both ears to work in balance. Only the left ear works well
RWUHDNMW1HG4Y,5,works.
R1NQ0EEQFZ5W0W,3,When it works it is a terrific unit. It is extremely inconsistent however. Sound will cut in and out as will interference. You have to keep adjusting and sometimes that doesn't even work. Customer service seems pretty good however so I am hoping they take care of the problem. This was my first experience with wireless headphones so I really don't know what to expect.
R1OZI29PY9SNQF,5,Work great!
RI6EZK5MHGL70,4,Works great!  I like having the ability to walk around the house and still be able to listen to the show I'm watching on TV!
R1NWA68VL83AZD,4,A
RJ0M5UE1W07AG,5,Best I have owned. I have had 3 others. They are very comfortable with great sound. I really like the simplicity of changing the batteries. They are simply behind the sound cushions.
RMD6SOFACTR4Y,5,Great product and this refurbished one is a good deal 1/2 the price.
R3AQTTYSU6U2DX,5,Very nice. Wife loves I have these.
RXJCL6SD256CV,4,Nice and clear;  the charger works well.  Thank you a well made head set!
R15GHC5X91BVM2,3,"Sitting 5ft from the transmitter, there are still little crackles that are easy to hear.<br /><br />Additionally, the charging feature is super convenient and works as claimed.<br /><br />Acceptable ascetics.<br /><br />Comfort wise not bad, just super."
R27DQ2ASSD58X9,5,Great job
R22B6LKQWNF9JO,2,weak
R2YQYI96JT2YZ4,4,"Ordered these because my 94 year old Aunt had good luck using them.<br />First let me say, some new flat panel tv's do not have RCA or headphone audio out jacks. So, you may need to order an optical digital to RCA jack converter/adapter for this to work on those TV's.<br />When we realized these wouldn't work on that TV, we tried it on a different brand TV that did have a headphone audio out pin jack utilizing the included two into one adapter.<br />The instructions are a bit vague about how high the TV volume needs to be for them to work.<br />I couldn't get any thing but static until I turned the TV volume up over half way.<br />Voila!<br />I think they will do.<br />Perhaps Sennheiser should include the optical audio adapter with?  They are only about $5.00 on EBay. Would have made my life easier."
R2HGJATMHCMSGY,5,"I bought this for my husband as a birthday present. He loves his sound system, but at night the bass tends to reverberate throughout the house.  I'd read reviews for many wireless headsets, and this one seemed the best for the money.  I wanted quality, but on a budget (don't we all)!  He loves the range of movement he gets without compromising reception.  The sound quality is excellent.  I'm not sure what to do when the battery dies, but in the meantime, this was a great purchase."
ROCMJIJ3ZPJCC,4,Great value
RL8M9TQIP9AH4,5,Perfect!  Perfect!  Perfect!<br />Wow! we're blown away by the softness of this headset.  It's charging capability is easy as well as it's simplicity of plugging it in for use.<br />It's nice looking too. Price matches quality.  We highly recommend.
R117R0LF2IVDXI,5,"Love, love these!! Awesome sound. Easy to hook up. Honestly, it's just like being in the movies! I'm extremely pleased!!"
R5V0TOH52GDAK,1,"Cannot use this product.  It cannot maintain a constant frequency and pops as it adjusts.  You must be extremely carful as it can lose signal completely and then I believe it could damage your ears with the resulting very loud white noise.  Also, when it is connected, there is a very loud hissing behind the audio which is very annoying.<br /><br />No one can use this product.  If you see a higher rating, they are lying.  Just don't waste your money on it."
R2UW288CKKLGSY,5,Volume control and tuning allow for clean clear sound. No hum or hiss. Charges on stand without a problem. Only thing you have to get used to is wearing them!
R1C6ZY5RMSI9KF,5,This headphone is fantastic.  i can leave them on and walk to the kitchen without missing anything.  This was a great buy and i have found nothing that makes me unhappy...................<br /><br />  Bryan
RB91QICMAZHCB,5,"We have owned this wireless headset system for nearly five years.  I am not an audiophile but the sound they produce is really nice.  Even with a TV that is plenty loud, I still use these headphones because you can pick up many sounds that you don't hear from your TV speakers, like footsteps or a creaking wooden staircase in a movie scene.  They are comfortable with easy to adjust volume and tuning controls.  The cradle looks stylish and acts as a charging station when the headphones are not in use (and also acts as the transmitter when they are in use).  The headphones work even through walls, but not that far.  Maybe 30 feet before you start to notice a degradation of sound quality.  It is good enough to be cooking in the kitchen, bbq on the patio or work in the garage without much interference.  The batteries are your typical rechargeable AA batteries that can be found in most big box or electronics stores and are easily accessible when it is time to change them.  In nearly five years, we are still using the original rechargeables.  We liked this system so much we bought another early on, so we have two sets of the headphones and two transmitters/charging stations.  Each transmitter allows you to choose one of three frequencies.  This allows both my wife and I to watch two different programs (on two different TVs) or if we want to watch the same thing, we can tune the headphones to pick up the other frequency, which allows a great deal of flexibility for TV watching.  If I could change one thing about them, I would change the auto-shutoff feature.  This feature automatically shuts down the transmitter after a few minutes of inactivity.  This is normally a good idea, but I sometimes fall asleep watching Netflix, so when the show ends and the transmitter shuts off, I am left with static in the headphones which always wakes me up.  Aside from that little oddity, this system is great.  I couldn't imagine our entertainment system without these headphones!"
R2K8GMDPN3Z6IJ,5,"Great quality and battery life, so far I have never run out of juice after using it for more than 5 hours. I was able to use it even when i was more than 70 feet away from the transmitter/charger."
R3UCUTAEL15Z5V,5,My husband needs headphones because he is audio challenged when watching TV.  I had bought him a pair several years ago and they finally gave out.  I was so pleased to find another pair almost like his old headphones.  THese save my hearing too as I am able to keep the sound down fro my ears.
R23OMD8RHBLUMP,5,My second set and they are great.  Thanks for the fast delivery.
R1O85WTCF3QTY4,5,"Does everything I hoped it would.  Provides clear, crisp sound so I can not only hear but understand the dialog of my favorite programs.  Like not having to mess with tangled wires.  Only wished my Sony Home Theater was capable of directing sound through the earphones while still sending sound through it's speakers.  Only have to have the sound loud now when playing DVD's."
R3ODQEU9DV2WJN,5,I did some research before making the purchase.  Most of the other products reviewed had negative comments about the sound not being in sync with the picture.  So I decided to spend a bit more money and purchase the Sennheiser RS120.  I am extremely happy with the purchase.  There is no delay in the sound and now I can enjoy late night TV without disturbing others in the house.
R3PSHX9XS3RYSD,5,Plug and play.  The headphones let me hear things I could not hear before.  I am hard of hearing.
R2MOQ9T9BH02U6,5,"They work well, I'm thinking on buying one more for the wife."
R2LN5OJGVSNQGD,1,"These headphones did not work well for me. I need headphones for my job as a transcriptionist. I work from home with my 2 young children that I need to keep in sight so I work in the same room as they watch TV and play. I need to be able to dull all the other noises to make the dictators the most prominent sound. With that being said, these headphones did not cover my entire ear. The design is not the cushioned style that covers the whole ear. They're just large foam pads. There was also A LOT of fuzzy feedback and I picked up a lot more noise than I do with corded, ear-covering headphones. It was very distracting and I returned them the same day I got them.<br /><br />I've read the reviews and these may be a good fit for the needs/wants of other users but for me...NOPE. I'm going back to corded, ear-covering headphones with the wonderful noise-cancelling feature and they are cheaper too!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for the hassle-free return (even though I did have to pay shipping to return them)  but still..."
R21JQWMJMXPX4X,5,This has helped me hear the tv much better.  I can even go upstairs and hear what is being said on the tv . Love them!
R3B019WL2K68S0,4,"Fantastic to use for those hard to hear movies! Warning: do not use regular batteries, rechargeable only. Not a problem though. The headphones recharge your rechargeable batteries when not in use!"
R27ZSX2HBL3CEP,5,"great, as advertised"
R18Z0JSSXVH8SE,5,This is the second set of these headphones I've bought.  Other reviewers talk about the quality of sound but I bought these so my<br />husband could watch tv without the whole neighborhood hearing it. (his hearing loss). I actually did buy them for the quality too. He uses them constantly and they have held up to plenty of wear and tear.  I've recommended them to friends with the same problem and they love them too.  He even takes them when we go away for the winter!
R20P4F1QQZFTB4,4,Comfortable muffs & like the wireless concept but have had trouble figuring out how & where to plug the base in since we have surround sound system. Tried plugging into TV & sound system but so far have not gotten sound out of them.
R3KRI1U5A1W1J0,3,Did not work.  Amazon was so nice helping me to return it.  They are always helpful and polite. I love shopping on line and Amazon is the best
R2BUQVT98LUQZC,5,always use it
R2K36IP2PLYMCL,4,Very light weight with good sound
R1ACXL3GJSD1WK,5,"Works like a charm.  Excellent sound quality, comfortable to wear and recharges quickly!"
R16BC75MYDV39T,4,"I also own a much more expensive pair of Sennheisers, the controls on these r easier to use while in darker places, (watching tv in bed)."
R13VGZGL7E9CGS,5,"These are great, can't watch TV or a movie without them. Amazing how the sounds come so alive."
R24CB0AJBTHWJ4,5,"I use headphones on occasion to listen to TV without disturbing my sleeping mate. This purchase was a replacement for a cheaper set that was chewed by my dog in a fit of destructive creativity .  Have to thank the dog!  The old set had me in agony after 45 minutes of use.  The big question always came down to whether to finish listening to the show, or relieve the pain in my head caused by the headphones pressing on the temples of my eyeglasses.<br /><br />The Sennheisers are extremely comfortable.  Even for a two hour movie, there is no pain. The sound quality is excellent. You don't have to worry about turning your head slightly the wrong way and getting static since they are RF.  You can even leave the room to get a snack and still hear the show. And I love not having to replace batteries.  Worth every penny!"
R22NOH4665PHUO,4,As expected very good product
RSGRHPGUJZ9B0,5,"I Love this wireless headset.  It is comfortable to wear, works very well and is a marriage saver!"
R3RNPG161YCUYY,2,"Sound was not up to using for classical music, and they had an annoying tendency to switch channels when I moved around."
R1LYS3WBS3SW3B,5,"These really worked out well for an elderly person who only has use of one hand and is a bit deaf.  They are very easy to put in the cradle for charging and to take off to wear using only one hand.  The sound is great for watching TV for someone who is very hard of hearing, especially where a corded headphone is not an option.  While I haven't used them with any high end audio sources, I suspect they would be fine based on what I've heard through the television while watching concerts or something in a music heavy format."
R17RK39XY5FBH2,4,"I use my set strictly for late night TV.  While the recharging cradle is a tremendous upgrade over having to plug a charging wire in, the sound from this head set is not quite as good a quality as the much cheaper RCA set I had.  I do think the on/off switch is easier to operate.  Maybe not great, but it is a good headset."
RYPCPG3DG1IP7,4,Using it for a long time and it works great.  We have two sets for me and my suppose.
R3GF03C6RWY6H8,5,Best I've ever owned. No need to spend anymore money.These are perfect.
RW5Y5FPLG3FG8,5,GREAT!! wish we had gotten them a long time ago.
RNFZ395LPEM9Y,4,Range and sound are great. The unit does feel a little heavy on the head but if you don't mind that the rewards are also there.
R3AQ19QOP3IGBP,4,Excellent sound for watching TV with the volume low.
RTO205OLCP9E8,5,I am amazed by the sound quality and the range of these headphones.<br />Despite their size I can lay my head on my pillow and listen in one ear. I just have to slide the side up that I'm laying on and I still get good sound in the other ear.<br />I will soon be buying a pair for the living room. They sound so much better than TV Ears which aren't even stereo.
RZX92DDQ4AV5B,4,Work well except for my unusual problem of having two separate sets for two different TV's in two separate areas.  They are faultless when not competing with each other for the same channel or interrupted by electrical activity in the path.  The critical switch on the bottom front could be made more obvious and maybe an arrow pointing to it in the directions.
R3FHU8XLFJVHQ7,5,Love it!
RKRMO5MZ7F7OQ,5,"Excellent choice, really good product"
R26NSMCDHD426U,1,"Clamping pressure to tight.  No ear cup and so earphone presses against ear. very painful after just a short time.  Also will not stay on head when walking (again due to poor ear cup design).  There is a definite delay in the sound coming through the earphones versus the TV speakers so the sound is out of synchronization with the picture.  Also due to the synchronization problems, I cannot use it when my wife is listening to the TV speakers.  Having used some Sennheiser aviation products, I was surprised at the poor product quality and performance. I would not recommend the product and wish I had returned it."
RJUL8N9UPT715,5,These work great. Now we don't have to turn up the volumn on the TV set.
R1IIMDHZE18P93,5,"I enjoy listening to my TV shows and doing housework and exercising. I had a pair of Rocketfish Headphones, I really liked those in my previous house. I had lived in a fairy new townhome and did not have any issues with the Rocketfish headphones penetrating through the walls. I now live in an older home with plaster walls. For those that have plaster, I have problems with my wi-fi not being able to penetrate through the walls. I decided to upgrade my headphones to these and they work amazingly. I can go to the basement, outside, upstairs, all over and hear the TV perfectly. My husband recently purchased a pair as well and we can listen to the same TV show at the same time or I can hook my headphones to my computer and listen to my own show. Impressed by the sound quality and ease of use!"
R24LMYRSMFWXAC,5,Sound is crystal clear and audio continues to work from any room with no static.  I had TV Ears prior and they were terribly uncomfortable and very static prone.
R2WSNE337YWN6U,4,"A little big, but great sound quality."
R2A193C43EP18P,3,The sound and the distance it picks up from is great but if you try to do things like bending over while performing chores it won't stay on your head.
R1GJ5T00FWR4BE,4,"I think you will enjoy them. Great sound and very comfortable. If you have a small head, they may not want to stay on. But, if you are just sitting at your computer or laying in bed, they really can be worn for hours in perfect comfort.<br /><br />I got them so I could watch my action movies at night without waking up the other half. The sound and clarity are wonderful and I have not had any problems. Charge has lasted for over 4 hours so I think that is more than adequate.<br /><br />Signal is strong and I can cover a 3000ft2 house with little interference. I would recommend to my friends."
R1T9WSKIOTCFKO,5,Nice headphones. Excellent clarity. Can hear the sounds in the background of a show/movie very clearly. The only annoying part is the buzzing sound that comes when a show is paused.
R22B87XTNKR78P,2,Worked great for two weeks.  Five year old dropped it and it hasn't worked since.  Wasn't that hard of a drop either.  Bummer.
R1QMNIT37H1AXP,1,It was nnot what I expected it for use on game. not for tv
RBBF72UOA6YT,5,"works great. Has a great range, and good sound."
R1Y3K20PT7FD3S,1,"Junk!!! Has constant static no matter what, if u turn volume on TV down low head phones turn off.  This product sucks."
R3CKHMJ9QORURI,5,Perfec
R64FAT0QXQ6SY,2,I am disappointed with this product as it is too big for my head. The headphones fall off when I tilt my head down. I think I will return it.
R3RIE24FU6DQJT,1,"Bought this to replaced my Philips Wireless Headset.<br />The reception is ok when in sitting position. When you lie down with a pillow behind you, or put your hand near the headset, the sound will produce a bad hissing sound. Too sensitive and easily cause interference. My old Philips headset does not has this issues.<br />Regret buying this Sennheiser. Thought this is a good quality brand but a real disappointment."
RBKIPKB4829PU,5,love it this is my second 120 by Sennheiser  my first one I gave to my daughter after using it for 10 years (was sleeping with it on and cracked left ear adjustment) it still works fine so I now have a new one and am hoping it will last as long as the first will tell  to any that need help hearing or want to listen without bothering any one this is the best buy for the buck thanks .
RVVTUF4W1XT54,4,This is a good product. The audio quality is very good. It is relatively easy to use however it's easy to accidentally hit the tuning dial.
RNPUMLQ5D74M8,4,These have great sound and plenty of volume range. This is the second pair I've bought for a 2nd tv and is a newer model even better than the first.
R1URPS7EIYBD0F,1,Yes very nice
R2ZFL3S1XDEV15,1,"These headphones are probably the worst wireless set that I have experienced. They will not hold a wireless channel and have continual background hiss, no matter which of the three channels you use and how you tune them to that channel.You think that you have them tuned, and are listening, and then all of a sudden they drop the signal and you are nearly deafened by the outpouring of high volume static! Also, they will not stay on your head due to the configuration of the ear cups and the over the head band. I would NOT recommend them to anyone. For the brand name and the price, I certainly expected a whole lot more than I got . If I had the receipt I would return them."
RHQT5NP2EC874,5,Great product thats very easy to set up and use.
R22CTE7NPDJ5DQ,4,I purchased it for my 96 year old father whom almost deaf it works well but he cant remember to use it . I am very hard of hearing my self so when he passes I will take it home and use it my self
R13LJRJPVBXK1A,5,very good
RBCV5HV9E7QKD,5,Exelent
R1S0DM0K369R7G,4,It is great I can hear the Tv from my sewing room  a little bit of static which bugs me but otherwise great.
R1RUL4UBWAQTQU,5,Everything worked as advertised. Sound is good.
R2MHEO9G11O3DT,5,"Someone wants to watch TV? Someone else wants to sleep? Perfect solution right here. On-Off, tuning and volume controls work as they're supposed to. Price is right too."
R1Q163YSP6KZJV,5,Work great. Always charged.
R1NG641SEMJQ4R,5,These headphones are excellent. My husband is an early riser and loves to watch the news on TV while I'm still sleeping. I go to bed late and want to watch things after he's asleep. Now we're both happy.
R3M52NIG2N45L,5,"Awesome, good buy"
R91DKKBRIB1O0,5,Good sound quality.  Easy adjustments for volume and tuning.
RP2M6V4XQBFXN,3,"The headphones have great sound but in quiet times of show being watched there is a slight hiss. The overall look is very nice, The  stand is handy and very functional . My old headphones I was always having to change the batteries now they charge on the stand. The thing I like the least is the fit. The ear piece is flat and no cup around the ears so they fall off if your tilt your head"
R3PRC1KK1M6R1A,4,"The sound is very clear, and the device simple and easy to work."
R29VKADY1ISGY8,1,"I have had this device now for over a year. It simply does not work reliably within about two weeks of purchase. Most of the time when I turn it on, I hear a loud static sound. Tuning the unit to snag the audio signal does not help either. I simply neglected to return it. Waste of money."
R34JVVR4T4Z78V,3,Not the greatest. They make a clicking noise. I've charged it fully and I'm not but a few feet from the TV and still they make that clicking noise. It's very annoying. Would not buy again!!
R3VOEGZF0RQ2SR,5,"A little clunky size-wise, but very good sound, and as it is RF based I can hear when I am out of the room."
RV7VC8EQT8QF4,1,"These headphones will kill your eardrums. I have nothing good to say about them. The loud static that blares in your ear when the audio file you were listening too has ended, is awful and painful. Or the loud, indescribable, ear piercing noise that happens when you accidentally bump the tune scroll and then you can't listen to anything else the rest of  day because you are trying to heal. Do not buy, awful poorly designed."
R3QHNFLIIPXEG2,1,Icannot use it in its present form because it is not loud enough on the receiving end. Also it does not vibrate enough
R36H0V8UPNV0U,4,Had everything and works well!
R1EUCPGWSUMT8M,4,"Good sound, comfortable.  I would give another half star, if I could.<br />My only complaint is that it sometimes drifts off frequency  and it is a fiddle to<br />get it back on the channel."
RUA5AVKNM6I1J,2,The hiss drove me crazy!
RM1D37U6FPP55,5,"I got this for my Husband , he is very happy with it"
R2K6WAJWFIU1LI,3,Makes your ears hurt because it's squishing your head so much.
R34SPR1AERGW7B,1,Don't even think a about buying it.  It has poor sounds quality and lots of static.  Cheap built.
R2LS1PLBR6LTT9,4,This is a  very good product for the price very easy to hook up
R3FLU9U30KGZNX,5,"I bought this for my brother, because he lives in a nursing home, and loves to listen to music, and watch a lot of TV, but he likes it a little loud.  That bothers other people, so this fixed the problem."
R1AHRXWLBJ32MW,1,"Could not overcome the interference on the headphones despite tweeking the transmitter as directed in the instructions.  Another suggestion was to move the unit away from the source of the interference, i.e. the TV, which was implausible as it connects to the television.  Could not find any company contact info for help.  Returned to Amazon."
RXR3Y5JHTH5VP,5,"delivery on time, headphones work perfectly, I'm very satisfied."
R3GFEWMQFG59I7,5,These headphones help me to better understand what is being said. I also appreciate the fact that I can adjust the volume for myself while leaving the sound at a &#34;normal&#34; setting for my wife's listening pleasure.
R1SUZD9TSSEY38,5,Very good sound quality. I would recommend it as a best buy.
R2L1WQ6PDLTT7G,5,"These headphones are great. Good sound, easy to hook up to my stereo. I would  recommend them to anyone needing headphones.<br /><br />They sound great and I use them when cutting grass and doing yard work.<br /><br />Satisfied in Florida,"
RPORREYO6MYPT,5,"I bought this Sennheisher  earphone rechargeable set. I am so pleased with this product because I am hard of hearing and the sound is just incredible. I researched this online and found it to be the best quality and price for a rechargeable headset. I wanted a rechargeable set because my old set used batteries. They are amazing and the adjustable headset fits everyone. I have bought several items in the past years and I am so thoroughly pleased with Amazon. They have the best pricing, shipping and quality of most top brand stores. I recommend this product to all."
R2P42UDDNMQUXM,5,"absolutely great sound! charges easily, quickly. Good price for excellent item"
R1VRT00VI9XY0D,5,Great reception on the wireless feature. Headphones on the other hand only lasted less than a year.
R1EA5BJJDWKOBZ,3,LOOSE FIT<br />Item does not fit tight enough to my ears to hear full volume:
R3FOP12LNH97AA,5,This works just fine and does exactly what it is supposed to do.
RX7P02KLF7BXU,5,We now own 3 of these and they are wonderful.  The last one needs to be connected to a Sony Home Theater system with NO audio out.  But I can hook it up to the Optical Out -Toslink port.  I have to buy the adapter.  After I placed that order I see that Sennheiser has a model that INCLUDES a Toslink adapter and cord on Amazon.  I would have purchased that one hade I seen it first.  The sound is good for treadmill and night Tv use.
R21OVLWP87F9N5,5,great product and service
RZTYIQP94KXS7,5,Setup was quite easy. Audio quality is very clear and crisp.
R3F5W76JQJ8QXT,5,"They are greatest!  We've had RCA and Sony wireless headphones, but none had the sound quality that this has.  And the price is perfect.  We've had our Sennheisers for some times (two sets as both my husband and I have hearing loss); we like them so much that we purchased two sets for our son and daughter-in-law.  They are enjoying them, too."
RGWU0D1BEAZBX,5,Life saver!  My dad is 87 and EXTREMELY hard of hearing.  I couldn't imagine money better spent.
R31T09ZYA2TXTV,1,"I thought I was buying similar to 130Hd of which I have 2 and paid about the same price.  The 130 is far superior in tone and quality.  The 120 is harsh and sound, brings static with it.<br /><br />Am anxious to return for the 130 or refund.  Your comments.<br /><br />Manny Hirschel"
R1MEHFYAHZLTJ2,5,nice sound
R1KYQFV1SETTM8,1,"I bought these for my wife, to find a replacement for her TV Ears. Unfortunately, these are very uncomfortable.<br />While it looks like they have &#34;over the ear&#34; rubber covers like normal headphones, they are in fact just black felt over a hard, flat surface.<br />They seems like they might be tolerable except when you wear glasses.  Have glasses on your ears and these hard, flat headphones on makes it un-usable in my opinion.<br />I have a pair of Bose for when I travel; so I know what a food headphone feels like. These are a very cheap design where it should be soft and comfortable.<br /><br />Very disappointed.  Would not buy these again."
R11BNX0VJZ8FNE,1,"It didn't take for things to go wrong.  The headphones themselves are heavy and hot, but there seems to be a short in the wiring that connects the unit to the television.  It works for a few minutes and then it stops working altogether.  It's not a satisfactory item in the slightest.  Purchased for television viewing, when it shorts out, loud snow noise blasts the ears.  You will then have to fiddle with the jack and audio wires at the tv to stop it.  Update, same date.  Went out and started reading reviews of other unhappy folks.  I guess our issue is the auto off switch in addition to a short in the audio wires, which cause a loud hum when you touch them.  Tonight was the final straw.  Husband was watching a drama.  Lots of quiet parts.  You know...suspense mixed with drama?  Knowing about this now will not take this item out of the trash bin.  Like myself, I suggest you keep looking because this item isn't it if you watch tv with silence to add suspense or drama written into the script."
R304O7NWZ95PF5,5,Great product!  A++  seller
R1I9QF9QJQUJQ6,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY DESIGNED PRODUCT. I have had my Sennheiser wireless headphones for two frustrating years. Unless you wear a neck brace and your head is held perfectly straight, this headset falls off easily. I will not list the wide variety of places this piece of junk landed, but just now it was in a bowl of tomato soup. I am completely fed up with this piece of trash. The grade school engineer who designed this headset must have been sniffing super glue. Purchase any other headphones, but DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!"
R18D5XGVMTF2I3,5,Love it!
R1L7FWNW6SJNSU,5,"Replacing my Dad's old pair. It showed up on schedule, works well and he loves it!"
R1F2PRR08BI5FT,2,"I need some help. I have a large time delay from the TV to my chair approximately 10' away. I have to turn the head phones louder than the TV in order not to hear the delay. The second set of head phone will not tune at all. I had the same unit before and enjoyed them until they wore out and that's why I replaced. I would truly appreciate your help. I know these can be 5 star but when your older than dirt some things cause you more problems than they used to.<br /><br />Thanks,  Ernie"
R1V1HMKBUAQICH,4,"Excellent sound. The only issue, without sound the transformer light will quit and a Constant bussing is heard."
RSUWN1SEZ82WS,5,Worked immediately on hook up. Charging is simple. Great range. Zero latency. No complaints at all. Perfect.
R35GJU3NVALUVV,5,on time and as promised
R3NY5MDTLIU2F,1,"This is a piece of trash! While I have never really liked the size, too big, heavy and clumsy, after a couple of short months of owning them, after resting on the dock in the off position (and yes the charging light was on) about 4 minutes after putting them on the volume starts going down and eventually to no sound. I received them on June 27, 2014, if I would have known that I could not return a piece of low quality piece of junk I would not have purchased them. They were not cheap, once again qualify and customer satisfaction ranks low on the list."
R2MIWSDRZ16C2X,3,Pros:  Sound quality is pretty good.<br />  Lack of cords to tangle or break is fantastic!<br />  Very comfortable for long periods of time.<br />  Charging station and headphones are visually appealing.<br />Cons: Horrific hiss when sound is not being driven...this is rapidly becoming a deal-breaker.
R2KDS40AYPRPFM,4,"Very good set of wireless headphones. I use these Sennheisers extensively for watching TV and movies. The sound is crisp and clear, with minimal static. Very lightweight as well. My only 2 minor complaints would be that (1) these do not have auto-tune and (2)they tend to slip with too much head movement. I find myself adjusting these for the first couple of minutes, but once you get it right, you hardly notice they are even on. Would definitely recommend at this price point."
R3GLR3DRW5JZD8,5,"These headphones are great. I actually hear every word spoken with clarity. The headphones take a little adjusting to get a comfortable fit, but even with my hearing loss from working in noisy environments, I can hear as though I had no loss at all. Once garbled words are clear to me now."
R2S6UW41NOM2QD,5,Very pleased with my purchase :)
R30BW8B9I6H3N2,5,I have these same  RS 120 On-Ear  Wireless Sennheiser in my condo in Florida.  They were a gift from my son one Christmas.  I love them.  I can hear so much more than I can without them on.  Both of my rooms in PA and FL where I watch TV are very open spaces and these help so much.
R1TON8LVVMOI54,5,"use it almost everyday. Love that I do not need to replace batteries. The range and clarity are very good for this class of headphone. Some of my audio fanatics may say the range isn't the best, but I really do not notice and I have had expensive audio equipment in the past."
ROIP8BZ6S6SX5,4,Great sound and easy to wear.
R2FLOIJ34FQH3E,4,This was the second pair I bought for my  90 yr old mom-one charger connected to LR TV- the second for her Bedroom TV -<br /> However the when I'm watching LR TV she is picking up that one instead of her Bedroom TV. Reception is great and wireless is so convenient for her .
R36PGBGXNVVKSE,5,"I read some reviews about hearing a constant hiss sound. I heard the same thing, until I realized I wasn't tuning it as best as possible. Once you find the perfect spot, it is wonderful quality sound. I agree with another reviewer: the only downside is that I can't hear anything anyone says when I'm wearing them. Just what I expected from Senheiser :)"
R27IZCFQINFFFW,4,"This is my second unit.  Have had the 1st for over 4 years, still sounds great.  I bought this 2nd unit for my hard of hearing mother.  Plugged it into her TV, now she listens to television through the headphones.  She loves it."
R2PYOAQVVO8K9L,5,"Works great from my desk top.  Very easy to hook up--charged battery, plugged in power adapter, plugged in rca cable and put on headphones.  Great Sound."
R25DZ7XC8Q6V7M,5,"Both my husband and I are enjoying these wireless headphones.  I'm hearing background sounds that I haven't heard in years.  They are comfortable on my head, and it is easy to adjust the volume.  My husband says the music programs sound wonderful."
R1U7RO3DFOYE9K,2,"I spoke to someone at Amazon and commented that the headphone was defective , that the sound volume could not be balanced and the left ear was loud but the right earphone could not be made to equalize the the volume. I was told that a rep from the seller would call me to discuss the problem. To this date no one from the seller has called or sent me an email as to what will be done to correct the problem Please advise. Adolph Lovler"
R35K788H243NQG,1,"Not a fan of these.  Felt cheap and were overall uncomfortable.  I preferred my $20 201 HD's to these.  Twice the sound cut out and a weird static sound started blaring in my ears.  It was so loud I had to throw these things off my head immediately so that I wouldn't go deaf.  I have no idea what caused it both times, but I was already planning on returning them regardless of the deafening defect."
R2J1RFQHBFJGNW,2,"Not so good. First off, the headphones do not fit snugly so if you look down or bend over the headphones will slip off your head. Not a deal killer but an inconvenience when moving around. Since like all warless headphones that are no blutooth they work on an FM signal from the receiver/cradle and these do not have a fixed signal so you will get in the habit of constantly re-tuning them. There is also the feedback from outside signals that I have not experienced with other wireless (non blutooth) headphones. Today it was so bad I had to take them off. When they work and are not falling off the sound is good quality but all in all I would not recommend this to anyone."
RQPDLGU7NJ9TP,3,"I find the sound quality and range of this system to be a little better than acceptable for the cost.  My primary complaint is that I can comfortably use them only by keeping my head in an upright position, so I find them useless for the purpose for which I purchased them...listening while moving around my house.  It turns out that the headphones immediately slip off my ears when tilting my head up, down, or making sudden movements.  Attempts at increasing the lateral tension of the phones (by carefully bending the head strap) on my head result in only slight improvement, with some discomfort, while making it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve electrical contact on the charging unit without re-adjusting the tension outward.<br /><br />As this headset is excellent for sitting in my easy chair watching television or listening to music (but be warned I take them off before standing and moving around) I can recommend them for only that purpose.  The lack of a tone adjustment function is another negative.  The slightest look up or down will consistently send them sailing off my head.  If I'm not quick enough, they go crashing to my tile floor.  Fortunately, I've managed to catch them each of the numerous I've absentmindedly looked down into a sink full of dishwater."
R2KVP0SN23P5M4,4,I'd really give them a 4.75. Great sound for the money and love the fact that if I leave the room I still have sound. My Sony headphones lost signal if not right in front of base unt. ONLY negative about them is size. I wish they were a little more compact.
R1347E1CIB4GPY,2,When it worked the audio was clear and loud but...I found myself having to re-tune this every time I would want to use it. It would be ok then I would move and get blasted with static until I could re-tune it back to my audio again. I switched to a wireless Bluetooth headset and am much happier.
R1K4QE7IUZRNHT,5,"Ordered these for my Dad so he could watch television without disturbing others as he was recovering from surgery.  He would often be awake at night and wanted a way to listen without waking up our other family members who are light sleepers.  He said these offer good sound, was easy to install and operate."
R1HD6JQE7UYKFX,5,fantastic!!
R3N99DL4OJCGG,5,This is easy to set up and easy to use.
RYKWF5E3ZQ4FC,4,"Great sound, difficult to get a consistent charge light indicator . Must be positioned perfectly on cradle. Also good range"
R29LV4GQ3107X3,5,"headset work fine, thank you"
R1JY5PMQSKU6HV,5,Made watching TV fun again not a chore.
R2OM3DVV173PKC,5,You can hear everything with these. I bought them because I have a slight hearing problem was missing the dialoge on TV.They are great! I can hear the dialog and you even can experience the surround sound. Its like watching a show on the big screen. As soon as the HD120 goes on sale I will get one for my wife.
RC7QX29RZG0DA,5,Very nice!
R1MYOOOM76FMDU,5,"Great,  cfould not believe the great sound coming out of the ears.  Would recomend this highly"
R1WCQBMW57BKUJ,5,"Bought for my Dad, who  does not hear well.  Now he can listen to programs without blasting the neighbors.  I tried them and I liked them very much."
R21XH56PM1QO2H,3,I don't like that when you have the tv paused the headphones start a high pitched squeal after a very short time .I bought another cheaper pair that seems just as good
RI5H70ZHLBE7S,5,I've had these for about a month.  So far I'd rate them as excellent.  There was a lot of talk about hiss but I don't hear it unless the sound is muted.  I can still receive the sound throughout the house.  But if you watching the television how much roaming are you going to do.  The transmitter is somewhat out of site so it is not at all distraction from the decor of the room  I may get another par for my set in the family room.
RTRVJ5QO8YYM7,5,"I bought these for my boyfriend as a graduation present, but was worried about them after reading some of the reviews about problems with interference. He has had them for 3 months now and has only complained once, and that was when the battery was running low. He said other than that he has had no problems. (:"
R2PW2I0IVIEQHH,5,"These work great! Little bit of annoying static when your out of range or before they connect, but I'd still recommend. Wireless is great."
R3EI3VX65LEPCM,5,great
R1RAHNAMQEJ1KS,1,The hissing is constant and shifting with movement. When a cd runs out if you don't change it quickly enough a hugely loud hissing sound takes place. If you are moving around they are heavy and are prone to fall off my head. I would not recommend this to anyone.
R2YVGJPDPOJXQI,5,These headphone are superb!  Wireless and comfortable...great sound too!
R29B0N77ZQ5M9W,5,"Excellent product!  Quality of sound excellent!  Price excellent!  Has been working perfectly from the first day I tried it. If I ever need to replace it, I would not hesitate to purchase the same product. Respectfully, Thomas L. Brace"
R39YWJFOE9MFBL,5,Love these! I bought 2 pairs! We use them to watch TV & can finally understand all of the dialogue. Highly recommended!
R10KUFN44FNACV,4,Easy set up. Decent sound. Quality head set.
R1QHOD2D408HP8,5,"I was looking for a headphone to use to listen to TV while my girl takes a nap. We share a small apartment, both of us are light sleepers. After some research, I narrowed it down to Sennheiser RS120 or RS 170. The main difference between the two are the transmission methods. RS 120 uses standard FM radio frequency while the 170 is plug and play. In layman's terms, the RS 170 technically had better audio quality and you didn't have to fiddle with the frequency nob like the 120. I was going to go with the 170 because people were saying that if the 120 doesn't receive a signal in a while, it automatically shuts down and you hear loud white noise. In addition, I prefer to go with new technology since the RS 120 has been around since 2005. However, at twice the cost for the 170 plus my use case this head phone is more than adequate.<br /><br />After receiving the headphones, I'm glad I didn't spend more than necessary. The audio quality is very good. I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality is as good if not better than the sound from my TV. The white noise after a period of quite really wasn't an issue for me. If you want a headphone to listen to music, get the 170. If you are looking for something to watch TV, this is a great option."
R2HHL6MN43OOCN,4,"Everything works great, but the headset are way too loose. I wear a 7 3/8 hat so my head is not small, but if i tip forward the headset falls right off. My wife has even a bigger problem. We have adapted by wearing headbands to hold them snug."
R2Z89VOBFN108T,5,"Got these since my hearing isn't what it used to be and also at times I want to watch television while wife is otherwise occupied.<br />I had to purchase an optical digital audio converter at the same time since my tv doesn't have analog audio outputs.<br />The combination works great, very clear and enables me to pick up much more of tv/dvd conversation. Music quality is very clear with good bass.<br />Definitely recommend."
RWCDVTDD76HFW,4,"Excellent sound, headband and comfort. Great bass response. Decent price. Nice clean design.  Now for some of the limitations:<br />- Too many controls. e.g, ON/OFF, TUNING, VOLUME, but mainly inconvenient only for users who came from the high-priced Sony model 970 that has automatic tuning and uses a spring-loaded inner headband to control the ON-OFF function.<br />- The tuning and volume controls seem to interact on the model RS120, but this is adequately covered in the operating instructions (tune first for maximum sound, then adjust the volume).<br />- The EarPads come off too easily. This can be problematic if one lies in bed with the 'phones on.<br /><br />Since these are more &#34;nits&#34; than hard criticisms, I gladly give the Sennheiser Headphones a well-earned four stars."
R1BXNIL4EQE21O,5,"These are a great deal!  Bought them as a gift for my husband, who loves to watch movies, but never sits still.  This way, he doesn't miss anything.  Both homes that we've used these in are pretty small (1200 sq ft), but we've never had any problems with them!  They fit very comfortably too."
R2OC4WMK3TA1LH,5,"Works much better than I had hoped.  One thing to note -- turn up the TV sound high, and adjust the volume down with the headphones.  Otherwise the unit won't detect the sound on the TV and it will turn itself off after about 15 minutes."
R1NJ3UFEBCDXYO,4,this was good back than<br />pros I have two of these and when there dailed in the sound is great better than any headset till I bought my bose ae2. good thing was since I have two two people can listen to the same source tv or computer at the same time so late at night movie works<br /><br />cons if the receiver stops listening to sound it shuts off to save power and you get loud static sound. so I would always have to have some sound going through the head set and it has to be load enough or the receiver or headset wont recognize it and shut off making a load
R3DECZQNVSPQVL,5,Great sound quality and can watch tv without keeping eveyone else in the house awake at night :-)
RVBPZ5MPI44KY,5,great head set ... owned it for a few years before leaving feedback ... still love it and use it regularly
R18PYCN7RMDEFK,5,wow the try it
RD00WJP9YLEM5,5,"These wireless headphones are terrific. My husband has a chronic illness and needs rest.  Whenever he is down, I put on the headphones so the house remains quiet. They were so easy to assemble and hookup, I didn't even need a grandchild to show me how to do it."
R1YCJKII2UF99V,5,"Love the headphones!  However, these are not compatible with our LG TV.  I will need some sort of adapter in order to use the square audio out port on the LG TV.  My elderly mother was using TV ears when I gave her the Sennheiser headphones as a gift.  These are superior in audio quality and comfort!!  Once I find a working solution for the LG TV, I will definitely purchase a second pair!"
R38ZIR4PGVSNA8,5,These are great
R2PPDEXAY23M4R,5,My husband can turn up the volume to the crazy shows he watches and I don't have to hear a word!  LOL
R1T05F45RBV00Y,3,doen't fit my head properly
R1CI8G43ZTU22F,5,Incredible sound and clarity.  Worth the price. Well made & sturdy construction.
RR9QMRLNWBMTY,2,"I was so excited to receive my sennheiser headphones to only be disappointed:(<br />The exterior of the headphones and charger were very attractive. The sound wasn't bad either when you weren't distracted by the static. I was so annoyed with all the hissing sound and static I had to return the headphones. Like others, I was mislead by the 5 star reviews. Once, I started to read more reviews at later dates you do see other complaints of the static being distracting.<br />If you are looking to meditate or focus with these headphones, these are not for you. If you are house cleaning or watching TV, maybe.<br />Good luck on finding your perfect headphones, I will continue to look for mine."
R2EM3DMRPI0FZR,5,"My husband ordered a Sennheiser set for me as a Christmas gift a few years ago.  Since then he has also purchased one for himself.  Now we have had 3 visiting friends see us using these wireless headsets, and we have ordered them each a set at their request.  We can enjoy TV programs/shows/movies so much more now, because the sound is so clear.  I do not watch TV without wearing my headset."
R3G9EDJOV1CQFN,5,Excellent headphones. Also very convenient to use while on elliptical.
RONMXQXKCELN8,2,"Meh, cheap headphones for late night viewing. Worth 25 dollars including shipping"
R2WNRHX3V4T7YN,5,"I love this thing.  I have had this set for 12 years of daily use, but the batteries finally stopped recharging. The plug has lived through a number of puppies and kittens, eventually it will break.  If I lived in gentler environment I think I would just have replaced the batteries.  Knowing as I do now how well this system works,I expect the new one to last  20 years.  I actually am still using the old base and I have the new one safe in storage for the future."
R10PKU4BXWUI0J,1,"I had to try two of these and returned both.  The power cord wouldn't properly fit so wouldn't power up and the light wouldn't come on indicating it was working.  I thought maybe just the light was out, but the headphones never charged or worked.  It was tucked in a tiny spot and you could see it wouldn't go in for the last 1/8 inch or so.  I can't figure out how these got so many great reviews, and I had two of them where it wouldn't power up.  And I'm not a stupid person, I am mechanically adept.    Amazon support was great!  refunded quickly    Bought the Sony ones on here."
R36PE7JFRURZ4G,5,"Great service, works great"
RD14MDRLIEH0R,3,They fall off easily-<br />And you have to tune them more than you should- but the sound is really good
RJFSGNWTJBW2V,5,Easy to hook-up and works just as advertised!  Highly recommend this product...
RSVTS79EL284F,4,"Very nice.  Light and comfortable, great sound, good range.  My only complaint has been voiced by others: instead of being on all the time or under the control of a switch, the transmitting station turns itself off when it senses X minutes of near silence.  That's fine as far as it goes, but to get the transmitter back ON takes a few seconds of sound being fed to it, and until then the headphones, if switched on, blast out hiss.  You pretty much have to start the music, wait a few seconds, verify that the unit is transmitting, pause the music, switch the headphones on, put them on, back the music up, and start again.  Rather irritating.  Still, four stars overall."
R1W97S1B6LN1RE,2,"These were not expensive, so I'm not terribly upset that they're bad, but holy cow. The constant tuning is beyond annoying, and the intermittent static in the background while you're trying to listen to your music makes you think you're watching The Ring. Oh, and if you happen to pause your music/game/sound making thing, you get nothing but noise until you actually switch them off.<br /><br />The reason it got 2 is because the value is drowning out the noise in my office. It has saved me many times, and for that, I thank you Sennheiser."
R32ABNNSD8WQWY,4,"Excellent.  Comfortable on the ears.  After a few minutes of no sound, it does start an obnoxious static noise, but that is easy to resolve.  Just turn it off, when there is nothing running & turn it back on after something is started."
R2WKXUD987ZQ5H,5,They met expectation in that they are far better designed and reliable  than the more expensive Sony it replaced.
R2PE1MUVJ0MT5T,1,I did not like this product. The headphones would not stay on my head and the sound was not good. I returned them and bought a different brand that I am very happy with.
R1MVHTE7D2F3BG,5,Great
R20ILQS3ID3AHK,4,"Very good reception, worth the money, great deal on Amazon than other stores."
R3BWUZJ40HG25,1,We absolutely can't figure out how to hook this item up.  The directions are very minimal.
RW8OI54FVBF7,5,Work as expected ....a little too lose when bending over they will slip...but not a real problem...
R2NUOKXV80PUVA,5,"This is perfect for me. I am a nightowl that lives in an apartment building. I like to watch TV late at night and don't want to disturb the neighbors. I put the TV on mute, put on the headphones, and I'm golden."
R2WJM6WQK3TRNL,5,"Wonderful headphones ... great sound, great fit, and terrific customer support."
R1QN08AD0JM739,5,I love these headphones. My hearing is not quite as good as my wife. She liked the television volume a good deal the lower than myself. I was always interrupting her saying what did he say what did she say?. These headphones make it beautiful as I can listen at my own volume and can still hear her if she asks me any questions. We now have two sets. One in the family room and one in our bedroom.
R39R2AOJ096MWZ,1,Barely worked...Only used once...not sure what happened here but couldn't get them to work properly.
R1SVRTFHDRP8CG,5,Great wireless headphones!  I was surprised how far away I could walk with them on and still hear the TV.
R2LIW8S1QTBTHL,4,"It took a little while to figure out how to tune the unit. After struggleing with it for over two weeks, I finally figured it out.The sound is good, but not as good as the Sony'sthat I had in the past. The Sony's lasted for about 18 Mounths. I hope the Sennheiser's will last longer"
RKVZ1RNMO6VAC,5,I purchased this product for my husband who has difficulty hearing dialog while watching television. He loves how he can hear everything clearly with little or no interference even while walking away from the room. I love it because now I can hear my programs because he doesn't have the volume turned up! We had tried other headphones that you plug in to the television with a jack and were very disappointed with the poor sound and tuning quality. You can't go wrong with these headphones.
R2AFW01SEUG577,5,Got these for my father and they work well throughout his condo and on his balcony.  Sound is clear and very easy to set up
R1WVM2LIFFWT4J,4,"Love the headphones, however; NO WHERE in any of the instructions does it state to extend the headphones all of the way in order to place on the charger and charge. The only reason I know that is from reading other's comments on here. They are bulky so  if you are looking for dainty small earphones these are not for you, but the sound is PERFECT!!!!!"
R2K500Q9AGAW0,5,AAA++++ GREAT
RDX30ZW4MSGD9,1,"I plan to return the unit if it is returnable.  The plug to power the sending unit turns off the TV speakers so I can hear through the headphones but other listeners are not able to hear sound at all.  If you plan to buy this unit, check out your TV first to make sure that the speakers will not be turned off by plugging in the sending unit.  Also, the headphones themselves seem cheap as they do not have any padding and will not fit snugly to your ear.  I was very disappointed!"
R2D01YLSQ0IXOF,1,Unfortunately could not get to work in my home.  Returned for credit with no problem.
R3J3C1DAVWCODW,4,I've been using this wireless headphone for 10 years.  This is exactly what I want.
R14FPZVYXFRACQ,5,You can't beat it for the price paid.
R1IWJAYB8VJ44G,5,"Bought them for my husband, he says they're incredible.  Quality sound and they pick up from any room. Even walked down the driveway and didn't miss one syllable of Fox News.  They've saved my sanity! They even work with the TV off.  Am I a good wife or what....."
R1QJV3H3TUMCXO,5,"Sennheiser RS120 Proven to work well. I have tested two units over 5 years. However, you may need a digital optical to analog RCA connector converter to work on the most modern audio equipments."
R35IN5891FCGQ,5,"If you are tired of turning up the volume on the TV, trying to hear the dialog over the &#34;background music&#34; only to miss out because the actors always seem to whisper during the suspenseful moments, you really need to try this set. Not only that, you can mute the TV sound, and not disturb anyone nearby! The sound is excellent, and since the stereo reception allows the dialog to usually come in one ear, while the background music comes in the other, you can actually understand what they are saying! I actually got hearing aids a while ago, because of my inability to hear many of my favorite programs because of the ambient noise and ridiclous &#34;background music&#34;. I no longer wear my hearing aids, because these headphones have made watching TV a pleasure again!!"
R1L5QRCQBUA5DG,5,It is what I expected.  Works fine.
R36CMNHEEAVAFJ,4,"The RS120 arrived promptly and was very easy to connect. Adapters were provided but, not needed. The unit does provide greatly improved clarity from the TV audio to my hearing impaired ears at 89 years of age. I also have difficulty understanding people that speak rapidly. The unit improved this problem approximately 50 percent. So, while it's not perfect it is still a big help and I would recommend it to anyone with difficulty understanding TV. As some reviewers have indicated, the headphones are a little loose but, appear to be well made and are quite comfortable with very good stereo sound quality."
R3SKVQ3600WZ82,5,These headphones are even more enjoyable to listen to than my surround sound speakers.  Excellent sound reproduction and special effects. And very lightweight and comfortable to wear.
R2M0XQDVYAP42I,5,Excellent product.
R1IZAGB95P08C7,1,Not worth the box they were mailed in
RRC3F8TEG00QP,3,"I purchased two Sennheiser Wireless Headphones with charging cradles in Aug 2008. They were a great product to use since my partner likes the volume high and I like it normal. At first they both worked well but they had to be placed within eyes distance so that interference was avoided. We had it positioned about 4-5 feet away from us.<br /><br />During the first couple years we tried using the rechargeable battery cradle but without any indication of knowing when the batteries went out, it was annoying, to have to wait to charge it before we could sit and watch a planned movie. There should be a visible indicator showing the level of battery power left. Now we just use AAA batteries which can add up in cost and are wasteful for the environment.<br /><br />After 1 year, one of the headphones right speaker went out and we weren't able to fix it so I kept using it because I didn't want to waste $77. The other headset lasted almost 6 years, which is great but one day just completely stopped working. It's frustrating but I am glad it lasted that long.<br /><br />Overall, it's hit or miss on the quality of these Sennheiser wifi headphones. Now the price is $90 for each one, which IMO is way too high for an item that has quality issues."
R26SU4NCYEBATJ,3,"The sound reproduction is very good, and the convenience is as good as I expected. But the headphones have a tendency to fall off if you tilt your head forward, or turn to the side. Walking around with them on is a sure way of watching them fall off and having to make a diving catch. I'm thinking about modifying my set by adding a chin strap.<br />Of course, that's most likely to make my ears even more sweaty. Perhaps there's a way to pipe in an air coolant to the headphones?"
RS8RZJCESLQCV,5,Really nice n comfortable
R2UMOHAHRH27XX,5,Like the headphone. Comfy but a little to heavy. Wish they made smaller ones for small peoples heads
R2BKIF649C3XI1,2,"I have tried and tried to get these to work, but they don't seem to like my TV, so am sorry I got them"
R1XIW7XQV02069,3,Product works fine except the headset doesn't fit well. It's hard to keep on the ears. My first set of headphones fit much better.
R2FXRZQ2MJ83NG,5,"These headphones were a birthday gift for my father-in-law who lives with us.  At times, he likes to play various kinds of music very loudly that can be trying on the ears so this was a perfect gift.  My father-in-law was able to set this up by himself with no issues.  Today he came upstairs with them on, about 30' from the transmitter, and they still worked very well with clear reception."
R1ZEKKD2RLZPT4,4,Good product however doesn't work well with smart TVs
RILLX7YZ4L2KV,5,just as advertised
R8ALH7EXH4AOM,5,Bought as a gift for my father-in-law. He is hard of hearing and mother-in-law doesn't like when he cranks up the TV.  Hooked this up to the cable box and both the TV and headphones get sound.  He can listen at his volume and she can either not listen or listen at a lower volume.  Clarity is great.  She uses them in the middle of the night when she can't sleep even!
R2GHHQ44G27NA1,1,there is a constant hiss that's very damaging to the ears.......
R1XLN5BEIHX9J5,5,this worked very well for my 91 father who has hearing issues.thanks
R28TZ9RHOHPCQW,5,"I bought this for my mother who has a hard time hearing (80 years old) the tv. I set it up (it's easy to do) and mounted it on the wall. My mother loved it from day one. It's was loud (as she wants), clear static free sound and she could walk in the kitchen and still listen to the darn housewives of (you pick the town). The head phones were also comfortable without being tight against the ears.<br /><br />Previously she used tv ears that used infer-red to send out sound. If she turned her head the sound was lost to static. This Sennheiser did not have that problem at all. I gave it a five star because when you place it back on the holder, the holder would recharged the batteries. Note: there are no electrodes to clip-in to. The charging system is passive system that uses magnetic charge (I think) to re-charge the headphones. I do recommend this to anyone who have problems hearing w/o disturbing anyone else with overly loud volume."
RFINLOIXGTYUI,5,I first became the owner of a set of these earphones several years ago when I received a set as a Christmas gift.  I wear hearing aids and the phones are a God-send for me.  Without the phones I have a tough time with dialog.  We have two sets and my wife often uses the second set when we watch TV.  She does not have a hearing loss but finds them very helpful when watching dramatic programing when the dialog is being spoken by an actor with a British accent.  This purchase was to replace my oldest set which finally wore out.  I am not sure how many years I had the failed set but it has been many years.  I am glad to recommend these earphones.  Phil
R2RNT7QLS9CAA0,5,"After reading all the other reviews this is the wireless headphone I decided to try.  My neighbors are happy too!  No more blasting the tv just so I can hear the dialogue.  I have walked away from the base unit, to another floor of the house, to the back yard, front porch, garage.  It works great.  Also I got a second headset so I can rotate one charging while using the other.  It was a good purchase and I look forward to many years of enjoyment with them.  To all my friends who have to leave messages now, sorry. . . I can't hear the phone but will get back to you at some point. :)"
R1TYB4ED73YAYR,5,excellent produt
R1WAAR8I2ZGCYV,5,"works great! Till you break it (not the maker's fault, but mine)"
R1OJ4Y50X2Q4UJ,3,stretches out on head out.
R8YVZ9Q94H9CV,5,"Wow! I never expected these earphones to be as sturdy and yet light-weight as they are. Not only that, they are the first set I've owned to come with more than the requisite volume control, they have a separate tuner which allows the user to better focus the stereo feature while moving from room to room. Definitely, these are a keeper. Best bargain around!"
R2VQ6ZI29ZVV15,5,These offered a great solution to the challenges of life in a small New York apartment. The sound is very clear without  adventitious noises in our environment. I'm sure our neighbors are happier!
R1I51LLD3QWGT1,5,"Tried a couple of cheaper headsets and just couldn't get a decent sound, especially the one with a radio in it -- yuck!  So I went looking for simplicity and quality and found both in this headset. The earpieces pressed uncomfortably on my ears, so I found a soft hat that sits just above my ears and now the headset pressure is more on the hat than the ears -- a great solution for me."
R2R1IHNYL2PTPN,4,Works great.  Used daily and have one for each of my 3 TVs.
R4TO92C2H0W1A,4,"The Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones work well the (pros) they are lite, comfortable, have good range, and when adjusted properly the sound is high quality stereo (cons) the headphones are suppose to charge when placed back on the bracket after use however they are so lite it takes playing with to get them in a position where they will charge, the headphones seem to have a echo effect when the TV volume is up, if the TV volume is off there is no echo, so if you plan on using these when people are sleeping and you do not want to wake anyone they are great."
R1LRET5NK9WK7Y,5,Very good product. The best product by far.
R2AF8UWUGYWE3D,5,"I currently have Sanyo remote headphones for my upstairs TV and I wanted another set for downstairs.  My husband is a little hard of hearing and tends to blast the volume.  The Sanyo headphones always have a static crackle in the background.  They are several years old and I figured, that's just the way it is.  They also cut out if I'm not in a direct line with the base.<br /><br />The sound on the Sennheiser headphones is very clear and last night my husband walked up the stairs with them on.  He could still hear the TV, even though he was on a different floor!  That really blew me away.  I'm planning on getting a second pair for upstairs, now.  I know they are a bit pricey, but I always feel it's better to choose quality."
R9PVTTD0F2WGL,5,Use it all the time.  Works great and simple to attached to your TV.  I wear hearing aids in each ear and when I use the headphones I can take them out and give my ears a rest.
R7V3NMDEDF4XJ,5,Good deal and works great
R1WJ445FBJOHJ4,2,The sound is very good but keeping the headphones on your head is another matter.  Since the phones are flat across the listening side they  slip off any time you lean forward or back.  I can't imagine why the manufacturer had them built that way. (flat on the sides next to the ears)
R87YWBDSHWY9N,3,"I have purchased Sennheiser products repeatedly over about 30 years and at different quality/price points.<br />These wireless headphones are good. I am not convinced they are as good as their MSRP price point suggests, but the discounted prices are likely justified.<br />I use these strictly for computer use, so amazing fidelity wasn't a higher priority than price. I was just looking for something that would sound reasonable and free me from the cord I always running over with my office chair.<br />The comfort and weight is good - figure these are good for 2 hours of wearing without glasses. The stand that also serves as a charger is fantastic.<br />The sound respects mids like I would expect from Sennheiser. Very warm sound...neither the shrillness of earbuds or underwater-fart bass of the questionably-popular Beats genre.<br />The 900 mhz transmitter does leave a bit to be desired. Works wonderfully for video games or noisy situations, but the background hiss makes these, in my mind, virtually unusable for extensive and appreciative music listening. The incessant hiss at lower noise levels is aggravating - it's like combining the drawbacks of vinyl (the hiss) with the soullessness of digital...worst of both worlds.<br />So for PC headsets or TV listening, you're in good shape. At a 60-70 dollar price point, I think it's a solid value in that application. If you are a purist, best look elsewhere."
R2LLJEJAZSQCHG,5,I can hear and understand what they are saying when watching TV.
R1XR0H1AR0P327,5,Hubby and I both have a hearing problem and we were drawing staws to see who would wear this to hear the TV at night until we found out you can buy a second earphone. Now we just have to keep track of which one was charged last.  Sure make watching TV in the evening more enriching/entertaining.
R2OZEKLNT1YSLM,5,"Great sound for the price, very comfortable, nice design, all-around excellent for watching tv without bothering others in the household.<br /><br />I love Sennheiser. I've owned quite a few of their products over the last 20 years, both pro and consumer, and have always been thoroughly satisfied."
R3TA11SOY1UULA,5,I love these Headphones! With a second base you can switch channels on the headset  to listen to a second or third source!
R1TXJEYM75VACC,1,worked great but now does not work at all. bought in March 2014 but cannot return. I'm pretty sure I've checked everything on my end ( battery and connections). Thirty day return policy is too short
R3UCVN1AP1WYDQ,4,great price for this headset.Very  happy .
R3N6HTMVJMR1R0,5,great set of wireless headphones. I can go out in the yard and still listen to TV without static. This is the 4th set I have purchased for family. Fast delivery.
R28B3K1KSNAXSU,5,"Perfect.  This device works so well I bought a second one for my daughter!  Can hear this throughout the house, inside and outside."
R1G8Z89UWKIJQM,5,I'm a little deaf and needed the TV a louder than everyone else was comfortable with. These headphones work very well and solved the problem without wires. A comfortable level for them is plenty loud for me.
R2WOD6LCLOK5KT,3,good
R3CPDVVTLSAQPT,5,These earphones are wonderful!!!!  Everyone should have these earphones!  I feel so bad for people I hear say they don't watch tv because they can't hear.  My husband sent some to his brother and it opened a whole new world for him because he could hear tv again. My mother and husband can sit and watch tv all they want and the volume is on 0.  When I want to hear it I can turn it up but mostly not.  Ha
R12EALY5C75LUK,5,My boyfriend likes some tv shows and video games that I don't particularly care to watch. We'd rather be in the same room though... So these allow us to coexist happily.
R24Q50LT35C2PQ,4,Nice sound for it's price
RZPDLVJY9D9T7,5,"scratchy sound but this maybe my TV's problem, I love Sennheiser products"
R3KJHTK6WTQ3ZW,5,"I first found out about these headphones from my elderly uncle, who is hard of hearing.  I purchased the for my boyfriend so he can watch television after I go to bed; otherwise, the TV wakes me up.  He loves them!  Even uses them sometimes during the day because he likes the volume a bit higher than I do."
R2JEPZ13KM7KK0,5,I was so happy when I found these. Had a a set similar years ago.
R11Y6AE5S1TRQU,5,These headphones are the best I have ever owned. They stay charged for the longest time and the clarity is unmatched. I would recommend them to everyone.
R1XI620XGNA6Z9,5,Great product! Love the crisp and clear reception. :-)
R3AWOUQ6UI4M06,5,"Wife loves them. She says they are comfortable on her ears (she is very sensitive there, cannot wear ear buds). Great sound. She puts them on and walks through the house without a drop in signal.  She's happy so I'm happy!!!"
R17XY2CSG7UILN,3,Returned due to load hiss.
R1B2AOVJXQJSCY,5,One of my best and most useful purchase. This device allows me to enjoy TV at the volume that is comfortable for me without disturbing others. I use it every night.
R1L1M468GVAVFO,5,"For the money, this headphone set is an excellent product. While it is not noise-cancelling, it does enable one to hear a tv that sits near a window ac unit in our Florida room. Of course, this keeps the peace when I do not want to watch what hubby watches in the living room, and vice versa. The sound quality is good. We had a few questions which I found great answers to right here on Amazon from other customers. I had looked on the Sennheiser website, but couldn't find any FAQs, then I remembered there was a Q&A section here and it was most helpful. As always, service from Amazon was A-1 in every way."
R3PIFMMYZ7HLTL,5,The<br /><br />Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF performed as expected. Easy to install and operate. Good price.
R7SVBPHMSSA2U,5,Wearing it now.  Hear t.v. Better then ever before.  Don't miss a word.
R39KATPD64V5CR,4,"I would give it five, but the headphone does not stay on my head when I tilt my head over.  Otherwise, the sound is great!"
R34QO6ABAQ2SFG,5,"Replacement for the same exact product bought over 5 years ago. The previous product was used constantly, but the price was right and deserved replacement."
RQM0BVYJRF7NK,5,"I bought this for my hard of hearing father to watch tv without having to blast it in the living room and so far, there's been no static. it hasn't run out of power and lasts a very long time. I have no complaints."
R402C4E1SX9J8,5,Bought these for my husband and we ended up buying another pair for me.  We love them and use them daily.  No problems tuning into TV.  The charge seems to last a really long time (never been an issue).  We can go downstairs and to the other end of the house without losing signal.  I would definately recommend.
R2KN03NV73ZTQ,5,Much better than previous brand of headphones.  I'm very pleased.
R35QXFBU7XGQ4M,5,Purchased these after returning a more expensive pair of Sony's.  Husband has a hearing problem and the sound quality of these is better.  In fact we now have purchased two pairs.  Saves my hears not having the TV blaring throughout the house.
RHILSOZXYYNIQ,3,Sometimes the sound just cuts off and i have to tap the main receiver or the headphones to start it again. Sounds defective to me.
RQ5Z9H8IDDIS9,5,Works great. I almost returned it because my particular TV/Cablebox setup was not sending an audio signal out my TV . But then I tried the signal coming out of the cable box and it works. I didnt realize that the transmitting stops after a couple minutes if there is no audio. But thats ok. They are snug enough to stay on but not too tight if wearing for a long time. Very soft. Although you cant move around a lot because they will fall off but thats ok just hold on to them. I can easily move around the house and do things while listening to the TV. Great because now I can turn up the volume while my daughter is sleeping or other things are happening around the house. Sometime going to next rooms will create some extra static in the FM signal but not when there no physical blockages between the phones and transmitter. Great it charges by itself when I hang it on the handy holder. Sound is good although if the audio is real quiet you can hear a small background hiss due to the FM. Otherwise for louder audio you dont hear it at all.
R19B47GV9I8J5M,5,Very clear and comfortable.  I use them when watching TV after I take out my hearing aids.  They work great and I would recommend them to others.
R17HTRGHEHV886,5,My stepfather loves these. He unknowingly put non-rechargeable batteries in it and they were somehow recharging for over a year. They stopped working and I found out he was using non-rechargeable batteries. I put in some rechargeable batteries and they worked again! He has had them for several years now.
R1UCQCCI9R64I1,5,"If you need headphones for a TV, these are great.  I can now finally exercise on my stationary bike at 5 in the morning and not wake people up.  The only issue is I get hot.  The ear pieces cover more then my ears.  But I can live with it."
R1WRNYG3GG7AY9,4,"Got these for my dad, who is hearing-impaired, and he loves them. He can now follow the dialogue<br />on TV shows, or the commentary for ball games, without the volume being so loud as to rattle the<br />windows.<br /><br />There are one or two small negatives, however. The first problem is that the base has no weighting,<br />and is easy to knock over when the headphones are hung up. A sand-weighted base would solve<br />this nicely. The second drawback is the tiny controls on the headphones themselves, particularly<br />the on/off switch. The wheels for tuning and volume are also too small. My dad is forever hitting the<br />one for tuning when trying to change the volume, and I have to re-tune it for him.<br /><br />Other than these things, these headphones are very good for their intended use, especially at the<br />price we paid."
R1HMF7IUO8MR4K,2,too much static if you move. Maybe just the unit I had.
R1OJMB0TU91DWB,5,I like it but Otis to big to lie in bed and use
RYFVOGNYKQ1Q9,4,"i JUST WISH THERE WERE A LITTLE SMALLER.  This is a fab set up.  Two headsets one charger, thats a great way to go for a couple.  We love the clarity and the individual volume controls.  Peace and quiet too when my husband watches a station I dont like. I can't hear a thing!"
R1SD0VJPIC896E,4,Love these.  The sound is so clear.  The person with Headphones on can put sound level and person in room can put TV at there level.  Wish the converter came with them so they would work in all our new TV's.  Without converter<br />it does not work in smaller TV's.
R3GUOWXMQ6SR1E,4,"Great range and sound quality. Cutting out after several seconds of lost signal is par for  wireless headphones and is not a problem at all. Simply turn them off if that happens. Signal cliping is also not an issue if you keep the sound level from the source at a high enough level, which prevents the need to increase the gain of the headphone amp past the point of signal clipping. My only beef is that the headphones do not grip your head enough to prevent them from falling off if you lean forward to perhaps pick up something up."
R1QCIJ7WSTB5UZ,5,"The headphones work perfectly, was surprised at the clarity and battery life lasts longer than expected.  The only use case in my household is at a distance of 10 feet in front of the tv in the nedroom. My wife has yet to complain when I'm blasting game of thrones"
RCRUTT8HA7ELW,4,Perfect for my needs!
R2KO9R8649R7LI,3,"These headphones have conditioned me to fear the silence. Any time I wear them for a duration longer than about 2 minutes without sound playing, I am punished with a deafening static noise. Was it really that hard to find a more elegant way to notify someone that they left their headphones on?"
R2ZY5P8T7CDK9R,4,These work great. Can roam all over the house and still listen via these tuned to our large screen TV.
R33BDTZLKHH3F4,4,"Work well.  Like the way you hang them on the re-charging station, every easy.  I would recommend these for private listening.  I also would recommended for the hard of hearing."
R1KDBI3RLO7EY4,4,Product works well. Everything I hoped it would be.
R2Q8ISSZL8SQG9,2,"Massive amounts of static no matter what i tried...i moved the base unit around the room, tried different frequencies, etc...couldn't hone in on a clear signal..."
ROQ5M75B2RN4K,1,i RETURNED THEM ..  ENOUGH SAID????
R91KSG3262UXE,3,"Why the need for a &#34;tuning knob?&#34;  Not that difficult to implement an automatic tuning circuit around a known frequency.  Also, as others have posted, sheer lunacy to put the tuning and volume controls right next to one another.  Sound quality is okay if you max out your TV volume (TV speakers off), and use the headset volume control."
R37MMYUDA6WNAW,5,My husband uses this wireless headphone device.  It is simple to use and works very well.  Thank you.
R2EDGNGHE2Q0PV,3,"Meh... I was super-excited to take delivery of these, because of their clearly innovative charging cradle, which does not disappoint in its ease of use.  I also assumed the sound quality of the wireless transmission would be vastly superior to the 10-year-old pair of Acoustic Research headphones I was hoping to retire.  It was not.  It's as good as those were, but the technology really has not changed.  Presumably the FCC isn't going to approve a massive FM transmitter that you run from your home.  Moreover, two other very disappointing features: (1) The large, comfortable ear cups sit flat atop your ear, rather than having an indentation that grabs it, which means that they're constantly sliding around.  And (2), it has an auto-off feature on its base, which means that if no sound has been transmitted for &#62;2 (?) minutes, you get a blast of static in your ears as the base shuts down.  Thinking pretty strongly about returning these and just going back to the old Acoustic Research, which has none of these issues."
R8ERDX2BQEDM2,5,Exactly what I was looking for
R87J83RZ1J3LE,5,Oh yeah!!!  Tried several others and really wanted a radio pair that was not tied to a computer or blue-tooth.  Great sound too. I wanted BOSE but they do not have a radio version.
R1XBJI6IWSDO5C,1,GARBAGE... Would not stay tuned in....Had to retune every 2 min....Ate batteries fast... Had to have volume up to max on all stations just to hear... TV only 15 feet away and hard to tune to channel. DO NOT BUY this piece of crap! Wasted my money!!!
R1Y5KWVU9PIPAC,2,"The sound is good, but the headphones are more square than round and do not fit my head. Whenever I move they fall off. This makes them uncomfortable and impractical. These are the on ear design, and after a while the pressure on your ears becomes uncomfortable."
R1OXDN9NAKPDOD,4,Great Sound.  Works just fine
R22N7JKPNTWK7L,5,"This is a great unit.  I hardly ever watch TV any more without them.  Excellent sound, and very reliable.  I've had mine for a year or so, and it gets used every day.  I don't even use the surround sound on the TV, because this sound is so much better."
R1XWSFFG29QUOE,5,"Used everyday for years.  The only problem is one ear piece comes loose, but it can be easily re-attached.<br />Still works well for listening to TV."
R3VL52PVGQEH,5,"bought these used on amazon for like $25 ,great buy .If you keep your self seated they stay put  but if you go to fridge they may fall off if you bend over to get to bottom shelf. I love them and wear 'em for hours as I am getting old and I LIKE IT LOUD!! My neighbors DON&#34;T lol."
R1AET0Y7H0YTGV,5,"Christmas present!  Nephew says he loves them!  Parents say it lives in them!  LOL!  He says them have a sixth scent - as when his cell phone rings - they pick up a little static, so he know to check!  LOL"
R2IW0C7Z1IWGRI,5,These work really good. They have a good rich sound. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a good sound and doesn't really cost all that much.
R1FUJIP9SWI68J,2,I was surprised to find that there was no sound in the right ear. I checked my amplifier to ensure the balance had not been set fully left (it wasn't) and then tried on other equipment and there was no normal sound in one ear. However if the input was disconnected and the volume turned up there was noise in both ears suggesting the earpiece was working but not getting a signal
R2KU08C828E7IG,5,"These work great! It was simple to install, just plug the main unit into a wall electrical socket with the other end plugged into the unit, then connect the red and yellow connectors to the TV. (It also comes with a 1/4 inch adapter that connects to an adapter with 2 RCA sockets to 3.5 mm jack plug.) Insert the 2 NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries (included) to the battery compartment located in the ear pad, charge the unit for at least 24 hours, and you're ready for fantastic sound. Just as advertised, I could wear these all around my house and could still hear the sound. And the sound is in STEREO! If a door is closed on TV, you may hear it in one ear, and background noises on TV ( like being in a public place), sound as if you are standing right next to the actors but can still crisply hear every word. The headphone top band is adjustable so you can either wear them directly over your ears, or higher up and half way over the ears so you can also hear noises at home.   We went through 6-8 pairs of TV Ears over the past 4 years and got tired of having to replace a headphone every 60 minutes after less than 6 months of use, plus you had to be directly in line with the base or the sound would be lost. With the Sennheiser RS 120 headphones, we watched 8 hours of movies/TV without ever having to recharge the headphones, I could wash dishes at the kitchen sink, and never lost the sound. I wish I had purchased these years ago instead of wasting so much money on the TV Ears.   We bought a set of the Sennheiser RS 120 (unit and headrphones) for the living room, and also a set for the bedroom. This way we can always have 2 headphones for the living room, or bedroom. Also, if one of us wants to watch TV in the bedroom and another in the living room, there is no interference (only if the other walks into the other room). You can also purchase one unit (base and headphone) and an extra headphone (no base unit), but you will have to charge one headphone, then remember to switch them to charge the other. UPDATE: I have been using these since 2014. Right now the RS 120 headphone with charging unit is very inexpensive since there have been upgraded models, so I bought 2 more sets to have lots of extras on hand. I have 1 unit plugged into the TV cable box and 1 unit into the DVD player (right next to each other), so I don't have to switch the plugs each time I switch between TV and DVD. If 2 or more units are next to each other, set one unit to channel 1 and the other to channel 2 or 3 (located on the bottom front of the charging unit). Then use the TUNE dial to tune into the sound. I also have 1 unit in the master bedroom and another in the spare bedroom, so anyone staying with me can watch their own TV shows. Plus, it gives me 4 headsets and units to switch out and charge to ensure I never have to go without hearing the TV or DVD. I need to use headphones since the sound that comes out of my TV is too weak, and using a connected speaker system didn't work because the controller to the cable and controller to the speaker were incompatible (unable to pause, mute, etc.). I have had to replace only 1 set of batteries, make sure to use correct NiMH batteries that are compatible with Sennheiser headphone."
R20Z3THYGF3MWQ,1,"I had high hopes for this product but the sound gets distorted and fuzzy when I walk into the next room ,no range on these. It doesn't fit my head even on the smallest setting."
R2WNFK1DWF6BBD,5,love it
R2BKH3FY3XJ2S9,5,"Surprised at the analog tuning knob on the headphones, but it worked great. Bought two pairs and set them to use different RF channels. Headphone size adjusts well.<br />Great range and clarity.<br />Wish it had a pass-through jack for other equipment, i will have to buy a splitter."
R3F9E584ELHX10,1,"Not good. Light weight cheap feel, ear pads slip off. And then after about a month and a half of use they lost reception and all the tuning and channel tweaking did not restore the connection. Had to throw them in the trash after about 30 days. Not happy."
R1EEFYVEY6V67,5,This is the third pair I have purchased. Not for my self but friends and relatives. They all love the wireless headset. I love listening to the TV at a normal volume or late night viewing with the sound off when the family has gone to bed.
R2PBUN5YRK0SPH,5,"My husband likes it so well that when lightening struck the first one, he requested to replace with the same as he<br />had before......it works very well..."
R3PBQB1U78GOBQ,5,They work great.  The only issue I have is if you tilt you head down they fall off.  Its a weight to tension issue.  That said they work great and I would definitely purchase them again.
R26HYOL6F11EUV,3,The headphones arrived on time and were as described.  They are hard to tune without interference.  It seems there is only one small area where you can get a clear reception on them.
R2F8Z2G2RSUZ8,3,"I thought when I ordered this would be the same as my last Sennheiser.  Obviously not.  This one falls off my head when I lean forward and the sound isn't near the quality of the old one.  I had used it for seven years with no problem other than having to replace the cushion pads.  Oh, well...sigh...I will continue to use this one and eventually replace it, I guess."
R1JPCU3QPH3UOE,5,Exceeded expectations
R37DVOO79OI4Q7,1,The sound quality is terrible. There is interference in the sound. Noisy.
RYPR5LC5TSC2W,5,"Have now ordered Three of these and use regularly. Have visions of listening to Pandora, sports broadcasts etc while out working in the yard. Has pretty good range outside the house."
R29RF3YDFWGOHT,5,"A fellow aged rv traveler told me these things saved his marriage.  After listening  to my wife yelling at me for having the tv too loud, I decided I'd try them.  These thing are really, really good.  One can adjust the volume, totally independently, from the tv so the wife hears it softly and I can actually hear it well.  Plus, I can watch tv when she goes to be in the motor home and she never hears it.  Love these headphones and they're much better quality than they appear."
R1ECV1QYRWCVV3,5,Bought these to connect to my roku. Easy to install and love the sound quality.
R23QLJFV1QHRNY,1,They don't have a positive seat on the cradle; cheap materials; ear cap pops off on its own.; they're hot to wear. Batteries don't hold charge for long at all. Throwing these out and buying Sony.
R2743BUCQF9N0E,5,"You can trust most of the comments posted about these headphones.  I've had mine for about a month, and overall I've been very pleased.  I have significant hearing loss, and I was amazed at how much these help me and watching TV.  I've been relying on closed captions for probably 20 years now, and these actually free me from relying on them.  The sound quality is excellent, and I can hear everything crystal clear.  For those with hearing aids, these ARE hearing aid compatible, though finding the &#34;sweet spot&#34; takes a bit of practice, as the headphones have to sit in just the right spot for them to interact with my hearing aids properly.  But once they are in the right spot, they are incredible.  As for the headphones having a tendency to fall off your head, all the other reviews are correct.  If you tilt your head up or down, they tend to slide very easily.  However, if you just relax when you're watching TV and don't move around, they work fine.  As for battery life, I really can't tell.  I've use them for up to 10 to 12 hours per charge, and they still keep working.  I've never use them until the batteries died, but they certainly work well for all day use.  --- June 2015. Just got a second pair to use on a second TV in the same house.  Just put them on separate channels, and so far, it works great.    But I'm sure these will slide off my head if I move, too."
R3V2XZMKORZL82,4,"Wonderful stereo sound,comfortable, long lasting charge.  Slips off ears too easy, could use a rear head strap"
RD7SHETYN8G52,2,didn't like it head phone my ear
RX4HKEY0FEO3R,5,There is no TV out there with acoustics that will come close to this ear phones.<br />I am becoming hard of hearing but this is a must for everybody.  Until you use it you don;t realize what you have been missing.
R3LDTUIKX20YME,3,The quality of the sound coming from these headphones are poor to adequate and they also feel very cheap to hold and wear. Like the free airline ones they used to (or still do?) give you on international flights. There was also an intermittent hissing noise with mine
R14AUC8WTMKZMI,4,Has a tendency to loose the tuning as you move.
R2HX38JUPL5PA7,5,Good sound. fits fairly well. Like the clear sound. ear pads seem to be sufficient and not so thick you cant hear your wife say supper is ready lol!
R15K0MDB84SQR7,5,The best product for TV listening for apartment 'dwellers' who have paper thin walls between apartment walls.<br />Excellent.
R2NZW2GRJN5EYD,1,Excellent for the condition of my wife
R1P628T82T97OO,5,Purchased the headphones for a family member who likes the volume on the TV very high.  Now we can watch TV at the same time and I am not blasted out of the room by the volume.  Several reviews talked about static but we haven't had this problem.
RAMEBEY00VOG6,5,"THEY WORK GREAT. KIND OF HARD TO GET THEM TO FIT RIGHT FOR ME,I ONLY WISH WAS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME SEPERATELY FOR EACH EAR AS I HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM IN ONE OF MY EARS THAT MAKES IT HARD TO ADJUST THEM . GORDON"
R2BL9SRZJM1UA4,5,These work like a charm and can be worn between rooms.
RWNE2W566EDU1,5,Work great!
RB5FAZJYS3S6T,5,I love this product! Saves me from waking my spouse if I want to watch TV.  Have purchased two of these and they are fabulous! Definitely worth every penny!
R290VJKS1GTTMT,4,Cannot adjust so they fall off my head. Otherwise work well.
R2BDHJJYIHNCZ4,4,"Excellent sound, long-lasting product, but Charging stand is a little shaky. It wouldn't charge on occasion (loose plug or ???). So I switched to rotating the rechargeable AAA batteries in the ear piece.  Easy replace. Just screw off the foam cover, pop out the batteries, put in fresh ones, charge the drained ones, etc.  Batteries last a couple of weeks, depending on their quality.  You can get stronger, longer-lasting Nimh batteries on the Internet.  Beware though, picked up some from a seller from China that did not hold a charge very long.  Seller said my battery charger was probably faulty.  I couldn't argue since it was pretty old.  Bought a new one. Seller refunded part of my money to get a better rating. I agreed to go along."
RNE9T2F4CCQDF,5,"Performs well, self adjusting to reduce any static or interference. Sound crisp and clear. Your ears will become warm after an hour or so, but hey, you can always remove them during commercials."
R1J9MRNXP1Q8BJ,1,"At the beginning I loved this item, however, after 8 months it stopped working. Batteries leaked. I cleaned everything and put new batteries. In two weeks they leaked too and headphones stopped working completely. After several months we bought exactly the same model again. It worked for 6 months and then we got EXACTLY the same problem with leaking batteries. This time I bought 2 year warranty.<br /><br />sent headphones back to manufacturer for repairing."
RMZXPY6BNMDAF,5,Great set of headphones for the price.
R3HAD691BMX6TW,4,"I just received these headphones the other day, but so far I am enjoying them. They are easy to set up, the cords come with adapters for headphone jacks so I just plugged them in and was good to go. The music quality is crystal clear.<br /><br />My only real problem with them is that they fit somewhat loosely on my head, which is fine for just sitting and listening. If I am up and moving around however I have to be careful not to bend over and have them slide right off."
REKDCVC1GKVE0,4,"This did the trick.  While watching TV when the home Air conditioner kicks in it's like someone started a jet engine at full throttle. Turning the 90 watt/ch surround amp up to overcome the noise doesn't work, still can't fully understand speech.<br /> Enter the Sennhieiser RS120, Viola, Noise? what Noise?<br /> I order'd this with an extra headset and whole system works fine, plenty of volume and very clear, they have stayed tuned since day one. Other comments about the headset tending to roll forward while tilting your head down (like looking at the floor) is true, if it were not for that I would give 5 stars.<br />  If you are having problems like mine, I recommend this fix. They nock out the ambient room noise but you will still hear a phone ring or a smoke detector alarm."
R3U6K7U7DYLW1W,5,Easy to install....Very clear sound....
R3OJH15XIWBNSJ,4,"works great., only issue is that they are not over the ear, as was mentioned by another, and tend to slip off if you bend down;  quality is very nice, no issue"
R3E5RUQVBTTOGZ,5,Wonderful!!! Great. Perfect. I am really happy i have bought The item.<br />Works very well even if I am very far away from The base...
R32WI0JHSWW5G9,1,You know reading the reviews and whatnot were not helpful at all. I took my chances because I saw more good reviews then bad. I received these Yesterday and they suck. I tried a few things to try to stop that horrible buzzing and there is not a way to stop the buzzing. I am going to send these back to Amazon and get my money back.
RYL5S7OFFYDJH,5,"Could not ask for better sound , works better than anticipated!  I would recommend this highly."
R216W2T63BJKF1,5,"This is actually a very good product.  My husband is very hard of hearing and doesn't like when he has to put something in his ears like TV ears to hear better; this irritates the inside of his ears.  Even though we live on acreage, I know the neighbors can hear our television blaring.  I am now able to sit in the same room with my husband and enjoy the same programs without the television blasting away.  We've had to change the batteries a few times because my husband would forget to turn it off.  But that is nothing compared to the comfort he feels when he's able to relax and listen to a program without straining and asking, &#34;What'd he say?&#34;<br /><br />I don't know about the charging cradle.  I used it initially but found it deteriorated the batteries quickly.  Am I supposed to take the batteries out to charge it? I don't know but it's easier just to turn it off and on and rest it on the cradle.  Little things like that don't bother me as long as I have a happy husband.  I like this product very much and am going to order more for the bedroom and recreation room.<br /><br />We have drawers full of hearing products that don't work.  This works!"
R2L3XW4TQ478JY,5,"At last I can understand the shows from England!  Some American shows are hard to understand because there is so much back ground noise in the show - now I can hear what the charactors are saying.  My cousin who was visiting set it up for me, and he ended up ordering one, as did my friend who is a bit hard of hearing.  The quality of the sound is inpressive!  Now I can have my TV shows as loud as I want, and not disturb others while they are sleeping... One of the best buys I have made in resent years!"
RVHY78JIR1WT,4,"Work beautifully...lack a tiny bit in comfort, but a great sound for the money."
R14M580APHWLRC,5,"Great sound, great value.  Wish I bought these years ago."
RZZWYRSXO0IX0,5,Loved it!
R18TMQ074UA3FY,5,"This wireless headphone set works great.  When you tune it properly, there is no noise but the music or voice you want to hear. I have it connected to a TV and use it at night so as not to disturb my wife. It seems to hold the charge well.  I've never had it run low. The headset is also very comfortable. I have a smaller head, and it fits just fine. I highly recommend this product."
R11NL718EUCOD0,3,Is not good
R2TOHA9Z5UQM1U,5,Excellent headset.  Only thing I didn't realize it needed special batteries.
R221K9BKBSNC8S,5,I am so very happy with this purchase. I needed them to be able to watch TV and Bluray movies in bed while my husband sleeps next to me. Setup was painless and I didn't need assistance from my old man for once! I got him a set too for his use in his man cave since he likes to watch his movies really loud which is annoying to our roommates. The only drawback for me is not being able to lay down on my side. Otherwise they are the best purchase so far and recommend to all of the readers to go ahead and invest in these great wireless headphones.
R1ZAJLEA6XXBCD,4,"Instructions--confusing, Assembly--tricky, Performance--VeG to Ex"
R20VZX9HB3EGFB,1,"Very disappointed with this product.  I had high hopes.  One side works great.  If you &#34;balance&#34; the two sides, it's quieter than without the headphones which defeats the purpose of buying them.  If you tune the right side so it's clear and you can easily hear it, the left side has a constant buzzing noise that is very annoying.  I emailed the company for technical advice on what I might be able to do to fix the situation but never heard from them.  So the technical support is equally as good as the product."
ROL2AL8QFVM0C,4,Works we'll if you keep a full charge after a couple hours it loses connections
R2DNKX1UIRQX7Y,5,Great product works well
R1WBL2XANUW6W3,4,These work well even if you are quite a distance from the tv.
R1KO82NVP61UFM,5,"[[VIDEOID:mo2PJ235H73D7ZL]]The RS120 integrates and aesthetically looks good with my entertainment center with wall-mounted wide-screen.

Upon product arrival mom was totally negative, as this is another piece of technology that she'll have to wear, hassle learning and deal with. She can't hear the T.V. and used captioning instead, which usually is displayed too fast to read and fully comprehend what she's watching. (Hearing-aids are usually set-up to the individual to hear voice conversations and tone down or cancel-out background noise or sounds.)<br />Well lo-and-behold, she gave me a big smile of approval and a thumbs up as soon as I put it over her ears 'WITHOUT' the use of her hearing-aids!<br /><br />I myself am a night-owl and use this time to relax and just watch the T.V. but I like loud volume to hear the sound effects to enhance my listening pleasure from movies that I watch. Haven't had a complaint from the neighbors before I got these, but I do know I was getting out of hand. Now, I enjoy late night T.V. at any volume without disturbing the neighbors!<br /><br />8/1/14: Ordered and received an extra set of headphone ear covers and as you can see the RS120's will definitely have a place with my entertainment center.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/16: Still going strong with no major issues, even the battery is still going strong delivering the power needed through-out the night, as I consistently fall asleep with them on.ighbors!<br /><br />8/1/14: Ordered and received an extra set of headphone ear covers and as you can see the RS120's will definitely have a place with my entertainment center.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/16: Still going strong with no major issues, even the battery is still going strong delivering the power needed through-out the night, as I consistently fall asleep with them on."
RCD08BJNQVUCI,4,"This was a gift for my father he has major hearing impairment, he has hearing aids placed in each ear all day for hearing aid, he removes his hearing aids at night and he is very very pleased with the sound that is coming from the TV, he loves the distance that these head phone  are giving, walks all around the house with no interference. if these last as long as they perform all give them a 10<br />thanks for you product.<br />thanks again,  Kevin"
R24QETFXZK6FGU,5,Works very well - I'm very satisfied with this product.
RE5G9NJR6259Q,4,"The headset works very well--great sound, easy controls--and provides three channels in case of wifi interference. The wall hanging option is a little sketchy as the one mounting screw is close to the center of balance, so the unit tips easily. I bought factory refurbished and am not at all disappointed."
R2XCN82VEXE23M,5,great.
R1DZ9QLGCW8YTY,3,"I had an older version of this item.  The new Headphone's sound is equal to the previous model, but they are notably less<br /><br />comfortable."
RF4INJJLPF39Y,5,It has changed our lives not only for the user but for everyone else in the room.  The sound is so clear and the headset is light and comfortable.
R2A1IMNISXVO84,5,Quality product.
RXT4GQQRBVZCG,5,This saved my marriage. Wife has the hearing of a hawk.  I put these on late at night and with RF you can walk into another room and still hear the tv.  The sound is fantastic!
RWAK8BHHTEDN7,5,Very good product.
R2Q3C8AJVVYO0Q,1,"Arrived as expected,  but there seems to be a short in the headphones. I did not submit complaint because we could not hook it up to our tv right away and didn't know about it. It is still usable, and I don't use it that often, so no big deal. This was a refurbished item, I guess the problem just never got fixed. I wouldn't buy refurbished again though."
R2VA85S3HSI0VF,4,Pretty sure these were pricier when my wife ordered them for me for Christmas.. they work great. A little more occasional static than I would like but seems to be the norm. (Only reason they got 4 stars). I am not good about putting them on the charger but they have never ran out of juice. Usually three nights till I put them on. Wife is a light sleeper and these keep her asleep and unaware that I am drinking too much.. haha. My only other problem is that they get a little hot for me. They do not heat up but it is like wearing earmuffs inside.. I like coooooold so it's a personal problem.
R24PZUMUOF2KQV,5,This was a gift  for my husband & he uses them all the time.
R2AH0X16MEVGR4,5,"i got these solely to listen to tv loud enough not to crack the plaster or annoy the neighbors, and I could not ask for more. The headphones seemed a little heavy at first but they are substantial and will hold up, they are easy to operate and there is a general &#34;feel good&#34; quality about the the headset and transmitter--lots of elegant design touches. Nothing  bad to say about this purchase or its delivery. Easy to set up. Doesn't rely on line-of-sight so you can wear them around the house and not be tied to the tv uint. Liked them so much I bought them as a gift for someone else who is also hearing impaired."
RMJQ8LXCLNTSX,4,"Great convenience, comfortable, seems durable (unlike the TV Ears headset).  Seems to pick up a lot of the crowd/background noise at sports events.  Reproduction of sound is analog rather than digital, and thus not as crisp--but quit good, nonetheless."
R1SIU65SPM7WJ3,5,The Sennheiser RS120 on ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with charging cradle was easy to hook up.  It has crystal clear sound and the volume works great.  You can walk all over the house and still listen to the television show.  The only problem is the headset is a bit heavy.
R1SOHZIYXDBIIO,5,It is everything it said it would be and delivers great sound. I bought 2-I even bought an unused opened item- no difference.
R199P23GF5FLZK,1,The sound only comes from one ear.  these were defective to begin with but were being used by a disabled person so no one came to know about that.
R2YOMXR1XEKZ68,5,This item performs very well . The only improvement I would suggest is the addition of a mute button to cancel out advertisements!
R1EOOLBVO60MFP,5,"Bought these for my hard of hearing significant other. She is extremely hard to please with such purchases. Went through 2 sets of 'TV Ears' which she says she didn't care for. Maybe that's why she went through 2 pair? She loves these wireless head phones as she can go from room to room and hear her favorite shows. No complaints from her and I get good, quiet nights sleep. Installation is a snap, just follow the instructions. Worth every penny and then some. I highly recommend these. They very comfortable to wear according to her."
R15G9PWSPGHUTE,5,thank you
R3GZ4ZME54X3FP,3,Do not buy this if you have a Panasonic TV...You will have to spend a lot more for adaptors or DACs (digital to analog converter)<br />Sennheiser suggests a GEFEN at slightly less than $100<br />It did work well with my Samsung Flat screen without a DAC converter<br />I spent several attempts to make it work and finally ordered a FiiO 3 which did not work either<br />After that I found that a FiiO 7 may solve the problem. I have ordered but not received it yet.<br /><br />All that aside the Sennheiser is a great unit  and I liked the fit and charging station. It may not be possible to address all applications but it sure would be nice had I know in advance would have directed me to another brand
RLCYU2KEPSO18,5,"Love these, easy to charge and set-up.  Sound is fantastic and has a great range around the house.  Fits well to head and sits nicely without causing pressure pain on scalp or ears.  Easy adjustments just a fingertip away.  Great item and well worth the price!!!"
R1CNR9MP3NNVOX,5,"great quality of headphones, super fast shpping"
R2SRNMTY2W00CB,5,As described and sounds great!
RXHCCR9182ITP,5,"World great. Can go yo other rooms and it still works, even downstairs."
R1NEVIR0UCWN9,5,WORKS WELL EVEN THUOGH OLDER MODEL  GOOD VALUE
R1UF7QZN32AFPV,4,My dad loves using this.
R3NQ1XQPU1TO2T,5,This was the best gift I ever bought myself for my husband. He can listen to TV as loud as he needs and I do not have to have the TV turned up. He says they are very comfortable. Recharges easily.
R185735WBS2DGN,4,"Works great, but does not fit well. Will slide off head with any movement"
R3FK97S3ES7SR6,5,Got these for my mother and she loves them she can leave the room and still hear what is on the TV
R2GWEKQCMLFN1R,4,Verry good sound easy to  work.
RLR9DKKPCWFWU,5,These are great headphones!
R2V10MHAW2YYF1,1,These are good sounding headphones and loud enough for a old man who can't hear the TV without deafening the neighbors .<br />The are comfortable but will not stay on your head if you happen to bend down to pick something up .  The battery's will last a days TV viewing with no loss of power .  I have previously had two sets of Sony wireless so this is my third set of headphones . I like the charging station on these it very easy to use .
R1LBIL80893AGY,5,I've used this for about 6 months and it works much better than the &#34;TV Ears&#34; that I was previously using. The variable adjustment is great and it will work even if I go out on the back patio which is about 75 feet away with several walls in-between.
R3D3VLEYESFTNC,3,This is the third pair of these that I have purchased. The sound is great and the range is awesome. There is this one problem that all 3 have had in common...the volume switch quits working so you have a terrible time adjusting the volume or getting both speakers to work at the same time. We really like these for sound quality (when you have sound) comfort of fit and battery life. The downside is that they are pricey for having the sound prob;ens noted.
R4L5O6IGLYYH6,1,"These will be going back before I ever even got the power connected.  The power cable does not fit into the main base and my fingers are raw from trying to jam it in.  Stupid design, not worth my time."
RUHI1B74G9F5G,5,Love them!
R3IEWERANM929V,5,"Awesome, clear, easy to set up, and made my Wife happy!"
RG0DR5XAMSA49,5,Seniors with hearing problems would do well to purchase these earphones. I have recommended to friends and they have told me that it is one the greatest item they have ever used. Thank you.
R3T9XN7RFZNAYN,5,"OK - this review is coming a little late because I purchased these headphones in 2008 - and I still have them - and I am still using them every day. How many reasonable inexpensive electronic items do you buy today that last that long?<br /><br />The only problem that I have had with them was that a part of the plastic cracked on the headband about four years after my purchase and I was very happy to find that I could buy a replacement headset without the base - which I did.  I later discovered that I was able to repair the cracked plastic with some crazy glue, so I now have two sets of working phones with one recharging base. This works out well because I do not worry about replacing the headphones on the charging base every day. I just rotate the phones when the charge runs down, I just replace it with the fully charged one on the base.  One is always on the base recharging while I use the other one.<br /><br />As far as the noise and static that other reviewers have complained about, I have not experienced any myself. I think that this might be due to other wireless devices such as wireless phones or routers nearby that are causing interference.<br /><br />I guess that the fact that Sennheiser have been successfully selling the same model for so many years is testament to the quality of the unit. If they failed tomorrow, I would buy another in a minute. Being a sufferer of loss of hearing, these headphones have been a marriage saver because I no longer have to have the TV or my music turning up so loud to drive my wife out of the house."
R3D2R0XFHUTQOW,5,Great product. Works as intended. Purchased so my husband can watch tv without waking up the baby. We love it.
RCB9Q6BF0TMZF,5,Beats TV Ears<br />Bought 2 and love them
RL2C7TI2OBF14,5,These are great! Allows me to watch TV in bed when I can't sleep without bothering my sleeping husband :)
RAA6ER4IV881W,3,"Better than what I had, but a long way from perfect. It's difficult to get them tuned in so you don't get feedback and buzzing. Also the adapter plug for the tv audio cables wouldn't plug in the slot on my tv so I had to buy an extension for it. They do the job once tuned, but they are a lot of work."
R3KRXEAW8DW7BV,1,"Cheap plastic garbage.<br /><br />It was once a good product,but QA evidently is not a factor in China.<br /><br />I had a really great set of these once,and since the first set was so good,I bought another.<br /><br />They are now made of glass(not literally) break at any time and amazingly,now comes with no batteries,despite even though Amazon says it does.<br /><br />Another day,more Amazon lies.<br /><br /> AVOID!!!!!!!!!"
RLL2EW9LCNKWX,2,Had feedback and interference about 2 weeks after receiving the headphones.
R28VU57QHO9CPL,5,Completely satisfied with Sennheiser RS120.  Works in other rooms from TV and even outside.
RP1M7A9CTI7NR,5,Works great and I love not having to put new batteries in it. Something I don't have to worry about.
R3DZHVKV89LEF6,5,outstanding.
R2DAMD22SK41A6,5,"Excellent. There is a difference. Spend a few bucks more and get quality,"
RP9PP7OETD2KS,1,Not needed.
R1YX11CT03EOVS,1,"The transmitter died after five months. While these worked, they were fine for watching TV, but now the stand is useless, and I've got a functioning pair of ugly headphones with no purpose. I'd like to say \\""Decent product for the price,\\"" but to completely fail after five months is unacceptable."
R11MR5UFV91T1,2,"If you aren't listening to something loudly enough, this delightful piece of head-candy is designed to shut off and blast you with an earful of FM static after a set 7-10 minutes of use without a certain decibel level. I cannot even conceive the mind of a person who would design an auto shutoff function on a pair of headphones that has a full range of volume. Its like a dishwasher that decides to empty its contents onto the floor if not always set to pots and pans mode. This Auto-Shutoff feature alone is enough to make me regret the purchase of this otherwise well designed product."
RHEX22MGRUCAA,4,"Great wireless headphones.  5 star but 4 due to possible connection issues, which applies to all headphones for TV.  I use these so spouse doesn't have to listen to my shows.  Possible connection issues.  I'm experienced with home theater connectivity.  One option is to connect L/R to tv cable box, but content streamed from Apple TV or a DVD player would not be available on the headphones.  Another option which most people will use is to plug into the TV.  Many newer TVs are missing a left/right RCA type plug and have only optical out. An optical to RCA L/R converter is needed and not provided.  Radio Shack?  Yet another option is the headphone connection  on your home theater receiver (how I am connected), but I do have to plug / unplug the headphone connection when using/ not using.  Net is you may have to think about how you will connect to TV."
R1396F44RSE4EE,4,product works as advertised.
R3MKFOHB4LX3SK,5,Sound and range is very good. Now I can watch TV late at night without disturbing my wife.<br />For many years I've stepped outside for a smoke and watched the TV inside with no sound.<br />Now I can step outside with these guys on and watch the TV through the window and listen as well.
RG84JFJMPAYMD,4,Excellent product; the only complaint is that it does get some interference in some locations. I am not sure why.
R2597OI1D4XD79,5,1. Simple to set up<br />2. Very good battery life<br />3. Wonderful sound<br />4. Freedom from cables
R3GY5R9IMQBIJR,5,Very good product. Had to get a professional to connect it. Hubby enjoys it very much. Ideal for hard of hearing TV watchers.
R2BUQX1ENDIHQQ,5,The headphones keep the peace in our house.  + The sound is superior to little TV speakers
R2V86T7A2ALUUZ,5,These have made peace in our household.  He can watch his TV with no volume and I can read in quiet.  Thanks Sennheiser..
R259O9P3HMUA2S,5,"Got this item on recommendation of a friend who called the earphones &#34;a marriage saver&#34;!  And so they are.  My husband loves them, I can read in peace, etc., etc.  He also feels that he can hear much better with them on.  Yeah!"
R2AT4KYXXIBLC0,5,"Hurrah!  Now, my partner can watch all the gore and death he wants, and I don't have to hear the hideous screams.  He likes the sound quality even better than watching the TV without them."
R3CBUMHUBH8XCH,5,"Second set for me for a second summer home. Can't imagine anything doing a better job. I use mine for TV only,"
RW0ATUSLVORPQ,1,"I bought these for my dad as a gift.  They were defective and they didn't work.  By the time his birthday had arrived, it was too late to return them."
R2X6VRHCT38YK8,5,Very happy with these. Now my spouse can sleep peacefully while I watch TV in bed!
R12GMBEP8M7KVZ,5,easy to use and sound great
R120MIILYCOKKC,5,AWESOME!
R1HPR73NOVKGNP,2,"So after reading all the good reviews I decided to buy these headphones for my dad so he can watch his tv. Well after a day or two of using them I was really disappointed in their performance and comfort. They kept falling of my head when I was just leaning over to pick up stuff. The  sound quality is alright but not great. The charging stand is very nice though. I ended up buying wireless refurbished turtle beach headset (x31) for half the price. The turtle beach headphones are for gaming but blow these out of the water I think in sound quality. They also have different sound modes that increases and lowers the bass along with other modes. If these were cheaper I would have no complaints, but i think the are way overpriced for what they are."
R2NT65VUFH0XL3,2,After 5 months no sound from right ear. Not a quality product.
R2BY62OK4JXW5K,5,My children all work odd hours so these are a lifesaver in letting anyone watch TV and not disturb the rest of the family
R33SSO71TAZR08,5,"I must say I have never used any other wireless headphone, but the sound quality is excellent. I use it primarily for watching TV when the wife is asleep and I couldn't be happier."
R385UTEPZA26PJ,4,"I've owned these headphones for about six years -- and use them on average 2 hours a day, strictly for TV. I'm slightly hard of hearing, and these headphones allows my wife to watch TV at her preferred volume. Overall, they have worked well (lightweight, comfortable, I still hear telephone while wearing, they do not slip off my head, and have good range/transmission, etc). I have two small complaints: they are not very durable (I dropped headphones once and from then one, one side of earphone no longer worked), and secondly,  my wife complains that when TV is on mute, the noise coming out of the headphones, especially during commercials, disturbes her reading. I will be ordering the next level up as I understand they cup the ear better, and hopefully, she will not hear the TV eminating from the headphones."
RV7UKH199MJWL,4,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't wear them for more than 2 hours without having my ears hurt.  I believe this is just something that is going to happen to some people when they wear over the ear style headphones that press on the ear cartilage.  Everything else is great.  If you want to know if this will be a problem for you, try wearing a similar style of headphone or maybe even earmuffs for a period of time that may equal your normal viewing time, as a test."
R21WL55UHJW31,4,Good earphones but heavier then expected sound is not crisp clear
R1VA97YBL0Z01G,5,"Love my new headphones!  The range is incredible.  I walk around my house, into the kitchen or bedroom, and never miss a word of the news on TV.  The headphones are comfortable and lightweight too.  They fit as snuggly as I desire.  I simply collapse them snuggly over my head when I ride my stationary bike so they don't move.  What a great bargain. I have highly recommended them to family and friends."
RDVJU26DSADSC,4,"This is an excellent product. The only improvement I can suggest would be a detent on the tuning wheel (located on the right earphone just below the volume control). I sometimes engage it instead of the volume control when I am attempting to adjust the volume.<br /><br />The system is easy to set up providing your TV has external audio output ports. Our TV, though a modern one, does not. So it was necessary to do considerable research as well as some experimenting to find a connecting system that works.<br /><br />We need to get our usual TV stations through Direct TV so set-up for regular TV was easy by using the extra Direct TV receiver's audio-out jacks to supply the earphone transmitter. Our DVD player provides the same generous supply of connections which can be utilized the same way. But our streaming receiver, a Roku, has only one set of output jacks. We finally determined that Y cables plugged into the Roku receiver audio jacks would provide audio signals to reach both the earphone transmitter and the TV speakers. (I am a neophyte at this and there is doubtless an easier way to do all of this since with my arrangement I have to unplug and replug every time we switch from one signal source to another. Probably if I had the right cables I could run all my signals through the DVD player and employ a switching system that would eliminate all the unplugging and replugging.) If my TV had output ports or I was familiar with home entertainment systems I would have given this product five stars.<br /><br />However I now have excellent sound--far, far superior to that from the TV speakers--and can control my volume to an understandable level without disturbing my wife. I also have exceptional sterio. TV has never sounded so good."
R241RZQ0X13BPU,3,"The headphones are comfortable, and sound pretty good. The setup is very easy, and I got them working in a few minutes.<br /><br />The wireless reception isn't very clean, though -- even with the receiver only a few feet away from me, I can hear quite a bit of &#34;hum&#34; in the background... It's only noticeable during quiet periods in what I'm listening to, but sometimes as I move my head it gets considerably louder.<br /><br />It's by no means a dealbreaker, but it's just a little annoying."
RIDLTGUFK4RZ9,4,"After a few months, the headphones seem to work pretty well and are holding up under regular, almost daily usage.  They seem to have a steady range of 15-20 feet until the sound gets scratchy.<br /><br />I knocked off one star.  Compared to wired headphones (perhaps an unfair comparison), the sound quality is sometimes not clear and crisp enough to be able to distinguish certain words or lyrics.  If you're listening to people who articulate clearly (e.g., NPR, Colbert, Ice Cube), then the headphones pose no problem.  But maybe be wary if you're going to use these to watch The King's Speech."
RCL0622WNLN58,5,"Exactly what we were looking for. Comfortable, good sound, blocks out external noise. Great buy."
R2AIOEMNAMDXVI,5,These headphones work great for my husband who is hard of hearing.  Love the wireless aspect.  These are definitely worth the cost.
RJHGVL3OWL1ET,4,They are behaving well.  My wife claims she can hear sound breaking out from them when the tele is on mute.
R1TUO8ON8S566B,5,Nice headphones
RPT0ZYB79WKFV,4,"Lives up to every expectation! I can listen to music all over the house. Occasionally there will be a &#34;pop&#34; due to movement or a dead spot in the reception, but it is not objectionable. The one fault that they are somewhat top-heavy, and if you are moving about, it is easy to make them slip off. The sound quality is very good for the price."
R3OT44RDDZGDR4,5,"A MUST with ROKU !<br />How could you NOT want real surround sound with the big screen?  AND, it's wireless, so not a problem for more than one head set."
RK029QWFI1KD0,5,I was looking for a wireless headphones to avoid getting the cord caught as I moved around. Everything is great with these headphones. The sound quality is more than satisfactory given the price.
R2P4QHI4ULYO7X,5,"I like this headset, just don't love it.  First you have to figure out what is the best way to wear them. In fact, they are not reverseble.  Second, there is a noticeable hiss, so turn the volume down which may make listening to a problem difficult.  Third, ear pads don't cover the ear.  In fact, the headset feels funny in some ways sitting on your head.  Do they work, yes.  Is it the best fitting headset, no.  Considering options out there and price this was the best ones I could find.  After having these for quite a while, my wife could not be any happier.  They have worked flawlessly.  Up the rating to 5 stars."
R2M3ZV637UNHRR,5,Couldn't be more plaesed
R1M3HXOGNWAYFJ,1,"very weak reception; inexpensive built, terrible sound: I expected more from Sennheiser! I have other Sennheiser products and they have been good and well built... Not sure what happened with this one..."
R2BELZVUYS3IYV,5,Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones. Works great. Great sound. Just love it.
R1RVEES3Y5GFZ1,1,returned
R14E87UXDR7HZQ,5,Fantastic sound and easy to install and use. Good battery life. I have an open house where sound really travels. I leave the TV on all night so when I have guests I use this so as not to disturb them. It works just as expected and the price was very reasonable. They seem durable and I expect they will last a long time.
R1CW87GYN503R5,5,"I have had hearing aids for about thirteen years.  They are of great quality but even with that being said, I can't always catch everything being said at the volume my husband prefers the TV.  I bought these on a recommendation of a friend and couldn't be more pleased.  The clarity is wonderful.  I can leave the room and still clearly hear what is being said."
R2KFGG4MB2OFB,5,A little static sometimes but works well.
R29Z5RZXDHTZML,3,"Two years out, the right earphone suddenly quit working. We have two sets of these headphones and have really enjoyed them. But it's pretty expensive to last only two years."
RCEBNW621Z712,3,The problem I had is that they will not work with televisions that only have a digital audio output. I have two panasonic televisions and they won't work with either. If they included this information in the product description or in the installation instructions it would have saved me a lot of time and effort trying to figure out why they didn't work. Thank you Amazon for making my return of this product so easy.
R1PRBMH64Y2JXO,1,"I have had lousy luck with this product.  There is constant white noise in the signal and in less than two year's time, it will not hold a charge.  Would not recommend this to anybody."
RUZZSG4JM6CX2,5,This thing has worked great for the last 8 years. I highly recomend this or any Sennheiser product!
RIGURYO2SSH2B,4,I gave one to a friend and he cannot stop thanking me for it.  I have been using one for more than 10 years.
RT2P9JQNT5DP,4,Works great
R34118FGK4R1E2,3,"This product started out pretty good, but is now deteriorating.  I recommended it to a friend, however, and he loves it.  If I do decide to get another pair of headphones, however, I will probably invest a little more, to hopefully be better satisfied.  What is disappointing is: Reception is spotty, almost requiring  its use to be within a relatively short distance from the transmitter, the fit on the head is not very good and restricts much activity, and there is very little (almost no) restriction of other sounds.  But for the price, it has been O.K."
ROXSISJ799STL,5,I bought this as a father's day gift for my husband who loves watching tv.  With the headphones on he can mute the tv sound so his tv watching won't disturb me when I read.  What he especially likes is that he can walk around the house and out into the backyard so he can listen to sports (or a tv concert) while he does other chores.
R371N84SE5UK3Y,5,Very happy with the purchas
R3W2STT9HKS6OA,3,Sound quality is good. Controls are simple and easy to access but when you move your head they tend to fall off.
R27142WM0EOJM,4,"Sound is clear, but not loud at highest volume.  Holds a charge well and, once you get the hang of it, easy to put on charger."
R1YNT5EQ3ERJG0,2,"I expected a lot more from these headphones than what I got, which was pretty tinny treble, and that's not OK by me, so I returned them."
R13HDBUXVN81YY,4,will be buying this again for our second home
R22Z7U5KCMTCSO,5,Good price. Looked new  & arrived on time with instructions & cables.
R2F3DCFHEWVFKJ,4,Sound quality is great.<br />Range is great.<br />Fit and comfort are great.<br /><br />Only complaint is that value adjust is very sensitive to slight movements of the adjustment wheel. This can make if difficult to find the right volume.
RLDW1C2GB3DG9,5,Now we can both listen at the right levels!
R2ADPXLO3QTDOL,5,excellent headphones
R25Z03MMB0T026,1,Not easy to use with TV- followed instructions and even watched video.<br />Sounded simple- one red and one black wire- front switch- Oh well.<br />I have a newer Samsung TV only 1 year old and still can't get it to work.<br />I will probably return.
R2CYSAJIXB1681,5,"I purchased the headphones to keep the peace at home - wife frequently complained I had the TV volume too high.  This headset is the perfect solution to alleviate that complaint.  Found it interesting that many of the product reviews mentioned hiss as a problem - but I don't know why.  After initially charging the headset as instructed, all I merely had to do to remove all hiss was to perform a one-time tuner adjustment using the TUNE control on the headset.  I experience no hiss problems.<br />Good Product !"
R3PJ2DD8M040KD,1,"Second replacement order, second piece of crap."
R3R9PICIPRQLU6,5,"WE CAN ALL WATCH TV TOGETHER.  RETIRED POLICEMAN WHO WAS CONSTANTLY IN TRAFFIC WITH CONSTRUCTION ALL AROUND NEEDED TV VERY LOUD TO HEAR.  WITH THESE, HE CAN COMFORTABLY WATCH THE SAME SHOW AS THE REST OF THE FAMILY AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY."
R2HZCVLZBNLM0W,5,love it
R2YN6Y6Z4G69NU,5,Works great. I couldn't be more pleased. I like to sit and watch TV while my wife sleeps. This was a great solution. Comfortable headphones and good range. Paired with my Vizio TV without any problem.  The volume is much more than adequate.
R27SHSKGRDRUCG,5,No complaints whatsoever - just praise for this product. Well worth the money.
RDHOPCWFCKAFH,5,Excellent headphones.  The quality of the sound is wonderful and the fit is great.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.
R1R4UCPS7SNLL7,5,Great!  Used daily.  You can even hear little stuff in the background.
R1OYV5GZA3BTU9,5,Fast delivery and working great! Recommended!
R3CU4FY3N8O43R,1,had to return it. the noise was terrible.
R31KGYWEEH596K,5,Batteries never die on these things.
R2DPTDV1ESK7GR,5,"this is the second one of these I have bought, the first one was used and worked very well for years, set # 2 is new and should last my life time.... very good for the money."
R2HX6LHF6DAYS,3,"My wife has always told me I had a big head but after these headphones keep falling off when I bend over,<br /> I 'm not so sure.<br />The band is closed so maybe thicker foam would help.<br />Is there some way to shorten the size because I can't be the only one with this problem.<br />Two stars off for the poor size..."
R9B043GIUGUO5,5,Great headphones.  Glad I purchased them.
R6WRR6JHMMPN,5,Works great and the company has excellent customer service.
R338DMYLQKOQNW,4,If you don't know what to do it can be hard to set up. Learned this from support when setting up a return and their was a button that said free support for this product.  I called.  They now work.  THIS IS THE BIGGEST TIP: Instead of using the 2 prong red and black cable use the adapter sent with your product and hook both of those into it and then on the single prong side find audio out which is usually what they call the headphone type jack these days.  That's it.  Follow the rest of the instructions and it will most likely work.
R39499Q8YEFEIO,5,"years ago I had a set of JVC cordless headphones that lasted forever. Been trying to find replacements ever since. THESE have finally met that need. Good sound works Anywhere on my property I wanna go. Has NO Interference yet. Comfortable to wear.. The only niggly problem with them is bending over when wearing.. They fall off. lol.  Will be adding another pair for my other half soon, for watching movies at night."
REJH5DBNUI72Y,5,this head phone is  is one the better ones but it eats up betteries other then that is a great set.
R22MS5C2E1RGHG,5,"I gave these Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless Headphones, to my husband for Christmas. He is a little hard of hearing. He was blasting me out of the house with the sheer volume of the music or TV.  When I can't sleep, but he can, I turn the volume off on the TV and turn the volume up on these headsets. These are fantastic. I love them.  They are comfortable to wear.  Easy to set up. Easy to use and have great sound. Follow the instructions and enjoy!"
RPSJK7C9FMIWH,4,"It took a while to ajust the fequency to the right levels on the base and on the phone itself but once there no outside distortion at all,  Good sound for the price"
R242HWJQUP2PJP,1,"When I received the product I followed the set up step by step and it didn't work. I called the service line on a Saturday and they said they were closed but would have someone contact me on Monday. Didn't hear from anyone. Finally on Wednesday I called again and they said the set up sheets were &#34;out of date&#34; and did not include cable TV hook ups. Who doesn't have some sort of cable TV connections?<br /><br />Anyway, it's hooked up and works ok, but nothing great."
R10YPUDNTCEHCG,5,My husband absolutely loves these.  He is hard of hearing and these work great for him.  Also he can watch TV and I can go to sleep and not hear anything.
R1ZGIPDHPWCCUL,3,"They do not deliver great sound, as if you are directly plugged into the set, but it works.  I just needed something that works while my significant other studies."
R2HJAUCCNTWJ76,5,It's hard to say exactly how much I love this new product. There are many times when my wife and I retire for the evening together and I want to watch something on television and not disturb her. These headphones certainly do the trick. Setup is a snap and the quality of sound is excellent. Highly recommend this product
R1WZZXAHXNPFTY,1,Started an annoying buzz after a few months. Quit working entirely after 7 months.  Junk
R2BW8F047YHVG0,5,This is my second set of RS120 wireless RF headphones and they are proving to be a very good investments.  I had to add a strap to go around my head to keep them from slipping off when I bend down.
R22LGAD85OC0XV,4,"Excellent sound, very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, easy to install, very stylish recharging station. This product is a must if you want quality sound at a good price."
RLCAO24IFKD31,5,I purchased these because they are headsets that go over your ears rather than hang from them.  These were so comfortable that I purchased a second set for my daughters house for when I go visit.  Love these.
R2Y0ANG23RB4J6,5,"Product fully met my expectations; happy wife, now. Sound quality is good and had no problems with set up. Buy."
R1Z5U1YMLGCSA0,5,"These are great! I watch a lot of shows that others in the house find annoying, so wearing the headphones I can watch without bugging anyone! They feel great on my head/over my ears and they stay charged up forever. LOVE THEM!"
R2R2FB2O97PKS3,5,"I chose this product because I am hard of hearing.  I wear hearing aids but they are not effective when when I am watching T. V.  These headsets are awesome!  They hold a charge for a very long time., and they excellently produce speech from T.V. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone who wants or needs them."
RCD2SQ103QJ7G,3,"I own a very nice $120 Sony model for my big screen in the living room and I thought I'd save a few bucks to have another set in my bedroom.  I should have bought another Sony! Don't get me wrong, this headset does work and I'm satisfied enough to keep it but the tuner (which is auto tuned with the Sony) works similar to a 60's era transistor radio static and just feels cheap. The cradle mount charging system is rather cheesy as well. Bottom line ... it's your money! There are much better products out there if you have a few extra bucks."
R3CNRT7U37Q0PL,5,"My Brother in law has one----he paid almost $90 for his; I bought one described as just like new, and it was.  I paid about $60 delivered & on time.<br />I didn't notice or read about the 3 channel selector, but he told me of it, That got it going perfectly.  Good quality, sound has no static, signal carries anywhere in the house.  Would recommend to anyone."
R8YEWP0IY01KR,5,Very comfortable; crystal clear sound - much better than the sound straight from the TV; makes peace between wife with normal hearing and her hard of hearing husband.
RPCU3ITOLQ5BP,5,".. AND SO EASY TO USE ... I ORIGIONALLY GOT THEM SO I COULD WATCH TV WITHOUT DISTURBING MY HOUSE GUESTS...  BUT THE SOUND IS SO GOOD , I WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME I'M WATCHING ALONE ..."
R39M7DO68JLXIO,2,This wireless system is comfortable and great if it doesn't matter when the signal reaches your ears compared to when it is sent. But if you are going to use it in a setting where that does matter (like practicing with a musical instrument or playing a video game where the sound synchronization is important to the control) then do NOT get this unit. The processing it requires is quick but not nearly quick enough to utilize in a setting requiring instant projection. It will drive you crazy.
R20KDVWRS0BVKL,5,"Got rid of TVears which keep failing and I ended up spending $36 in postage returning bad ones. This one covers more distance, I can even walk to the kitchen and still hear. The sound is much better. Need to be careful as headset with slip off head. Glad I did this."
R3O8LAUA06E0RU,4,was 1 of the top 5.<br />the sound is excellent<br />had to get a friend who is brilliant with technology to set it up. I could not have done it myself<br />it works very well
R2Z9RHZMRUHDPJ,5,These are great headphones if they were wired and even better since they are not! The bass response is exceptional and are crisp at the same time. Sennheiser has stayed true to their name when they put there name on these! I wish that I had several of them for various areas that I do activities in. They would be perfect in a sound booth  environment were you need to move about freely as well as to walk out into the area that you are pushing sound into to make suitable adjustments. I have found sometimes they actually sound better than the house speakers in some venues!
R1WJQ1433D3UGN,2,"Poor connection quality. I cannot even find a good tune that can avoid all the noises. The headphone shuts down in 3 mins if you are not playing anything on PC, which generates big static noise and scares me many times."
R10RUGXKUIOPC0,5,I have this headphones for over a year now and they are great to listen to TV at night. great sound and the wireless has a good range for a bedroom or living room.
R22FCRV73860EM,2,"i can't get any better sound from this than my 4 year old Sennheiser headphone.  Also, the position of the ear pieces are at an angle that physically  hurts my ears - especially when used with one or both of my hearing aids."
R3R7Q3YMEN6N5V,5,"So far the headphones work fantastic. I have been outside the house over 100 feet from the TV and have no problem with the sound or any interference from anything. They will slide around on your head some and seem to be a little large but maybe I just don't have a big head. I have used them up to 8 hours with no low battery problems and they charge well on the cradle. They work great for me and I have had no problems with them. If you think the cost is high, &#34;you only get what you pay for.&#34;"
R3VWSADFOVOB7J,5,The headphones were easy to install and great sound. The wireless range works perfectly for room size. This is a better model than the last ones I got. Very pleased with my purchase.
R2YK4S8PNU0DQL,4,"Works very well with good sound.  Can be a little uncomfortable in warm weather or after long period of wearing, otherwise fine."
R1N5WHM5927RSK,5,"I haven't actually tried the latest one, but my previous ones work great.  One of them stopped working so I ordered the new one, then learned that I needed only replace the batteries in the one that had stopped working and it now works fine."
R2C8RGUU8C017P,3,Tehnical part is high quality.  They become unfortable after about 30 minutes of listening.  Over the ear design would have been a lot better.
RTUN3EO9HQTE0,1,Did not have the opportunity to see how well these worked as I found out these cannot be used around someone with a pacemaker so I had to return them.  I did not see any information in the description that stated this.
RGGPRMIQ2MKCA,4,My previous RS120 lasted about 3 years and then died completely.  This new one is good and I want to see how long it lasts.  The earphones are great as long as they last.
R3VYRS6R0J0XJ5,4,"the headphones work great, the only complaint I have is that the headphones are a little hard to get on the cradle just right to that they recharge."
R2ROPG5255KSRK,3,Very nice headset the problem I have is it is hard to tune it to the right reception and when you finally get it it only works out of one ear. It's been said before but their right you do here a hissing noise if you don't set the reception perfect.
RY6VE3XTNL013,4,Great value for the price. Would definitely buy again. Love how easy they are to charge without having to plug them in. Just being able to walk by and set them on the hook is nice. Surprised at the sound quality. Great buy!
R2F7MSZLNCZT5H,5,"I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND THERE&#34;AN 85 YEAR OLD CRAB LIVING NEXT DOOR WHO THINKS EVEYBODY SHOULD WALK ON EGGSHELLS.. I COULDN'T EVEN WATCH T.V. TILL NOW.. I LOVE THESE, WORK AS DESCRIBED- GREAT SOUND EASY SET UP , THANKS SENNHEISER.. WOULD DEFINATLY RECOMMEND"
R17MPBRVRM4LLC,2,"I ordered these wireless headphones,  but much to my dismay it didn't include all the hookups that made it work, such as the audio/visual cable. For the price it should come with every thing that will make this product work, function properly."
R3FYS9VHERK6J1,5,"Great sound, comfortable, and good range.  Wife uses these headphones every day for much of the day.  She walks from room to room and never loses connection.  Battery life is very good.  She simply hangs them on the charging stand over night and has never lost power even after ten or twelve hours of use.  An easy five star rating."
R1H895LM9WG3D0,1,"These headphones are so poorly designed that they fall off your head at every opportunity. If you plan to sit still on your couch and watch TV, OK. But don't make the mistake of thinking that you are going to get anything done around your house if you are wearing these headphones."
R35MYBEJB16SST,2,"The unit is designed to turn off at low output volumes due to federal regulations.  So if you are buying it so that you can have the volume low from the source so as not to disturb someone, you better hope they are in another room.  If you need it to assist in hearing it works pretty good.  It is on the ears rather than over the ears and slides off if you are doing even minor activities. Good luck."
R2PIDIIT0PDY5H,1,After a couple of months it turned itself off and would not turn on again. Otherwise it worked as it should.
R2IYDPQ7S2XQFK,3,"Setup is bulky. Headset moves/slides off if I move my head too much, Sound is good, but occasional static. Can only wear for about 2 hours, as the headset 'heats up' the ears. I use it watch TV, while wife is sleeping. Does the job better and cheaper than TV Ears. Excellent range."
R2NAVWPRXBJOXX,5,Excellent value and sound. it really allows two people to listen at their comfort level. One with the head set the other thru the surround sound.  Works well with the Roku
R2H1LPT8A3K0XZ,5,"This headphone brings out TRUE stereo & I am very please with my purchase.  It IS truly an experience in what I have recorded in the past.  The treble & bass are JUST right!.  I had purchased another headset from Sennheiser & 5 minutes after putting them on my head, I was hooked.  Then, I got the wireless & surprised, again.  What a difference does it make in my listening TRUE sound.  Thank you Amazon for bringing this to my attention & Sennheiser, you have created a superior product!"
RA5PC3IPLZ6FI,5,Got these for my dad so he wouldn't have to turn the TV up and blast out my mom.  They have worked really well and have lasted a long time.  SO easy to recharge just by setting them on the cradle!
R2R9QS1M1MKWRT,2,"First I hooked it up to my cable box, and it woked well  except not on my dvd,s or Prime movies, or something, don't rememer exactly what; I called tech help and the told me to plug it into my TV's headphone jack.  WEll thst worked fine for asll my movies, dvd's etc, but i never could get a good, solid signal, that didn't change w/ head movement, and i had to have the volum LOUD; and then if zi shifted my head, the full power behind the high volum hit me like a brick.  Had to return.  May be I have a poor phone port on my TV (LG), or something else; mainly I just couldn't get a good, solid, steady connection"
R3R58CS4YZRUGT,1,"These are truly terrible! They look nice but don't have a good signal, they emit lots of loud, ear numbing static and very touchy control dials, etc.!"
RT4T10HXC7BAI,5,"My brother stays up  late and plays the TV on the other side of the wall from where I sleep. I have been asking him repeatedly to turn the volume down, but the bass still  comes pounding thru. I bought these to stop the problem and last night was the first really easy to go to sleep with no sound coming thru the wall. Still to see how the batteries last as well as the headphones themselves. My brother also said these are the best he's ever heard. He had some cheap ones years ago and they were fuzzy sounding. These are precise with excellent sound quality."
R9YPJNJ3HL0H7,5,"Very easy to setup. I like the sound quality and it is very easy to control the volume. The Price maybe little bit higher then what I was looking for,<br />but it is hassle free and it does what it suppose to do."
R3PWCVDUTXO73,5,Late at night when everyone is asleep and I want to play a game or watch a late movie then these are great.  Quality and sound is great for the money and I have bought three pairs and will buy more later.
R10T31KEZKJSB2,5,Bought 2 sets.  Love them.  Fair price.  Great quality.  Excellent product.  Great service.  Keeps the ball and chain from chafing my a**.
R1SKC2C7CGWXFA,5,I wear hearing aids and while watching TV I still have trouble understanding some of the conversations.  With these head phone I can make the volume louder without disturbing the quality of life in my home.  They have helped greatly.  The only problem I have is:  I do not know have to set the headphones in order to watch DVD movies on my DVD player.  But to me that is a minor problem because I use closed captioning when watching the DVD movies.  I like these headphones very much.
RWDNKGVT9EPCG,4,Set up was very simple. The sound quaily is excellent. I really like the charging method. Easy to change the rechargeable batteries when needed. The range allows me to continue listening in another room of the house.<br />The reason for the 4 star rating is due to the fit of the headphones. They are loose on your head and will easily fall off if you lean your head too far forward. You get used to this limitation but it still is a pain sometimes.  Overall this is a good product that fulfilled my needs. I would recommend it.
R144LHHR64TJLI,5,I bought my first pair about 4-5 months ago to allow me to watch tv while my husband slept.  Now I find I love watching movies and tv shows to hear even better. This set has a very simple hook-up and has an outstanding clear sound. The charge is really good on a single charge.  I've watched all day and still never went dead.  The range is great too.  I even can go change my laundry in the basement and still hear my shows upstairs.  I'm now investing in a second pair since my husband loves it too.  Well worth the money.
R3GAMP0OB160JD,3,"This is the second unit I have purchased. The unit works extremely well and has great stereo. The first one I purchased has one<br />issue that I think needs working. The headset itself sits on the head a little to loosely, but the second one did fit a little more snugly.<br />If it were not for that I would have rated them as four (4) stars.  Overall I am pleased with their quality."
R1EU8TA4JQJSP2,5,"This is the best headphone I have ever owned.  I have always purchased inexpensive headphones, knowing that they were not excellent, but served the purpose.  However.  I will never buy another set of cheap headphones again, after purchasing this Sennheiser model.  These are the headphones for me in the future.  I realize that there are more expensive ones on the market (Bose, Sony etc), but for the money I would not pass up this brand.  I have a hearing loss and this has been a real blessing and upgrade from the cheaper models I have used in the past.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Thanks"
R4RMXUE54GQEY,5,"I bought this wireless headphones hoping to watch the FIFA world cup without disturbing the neighbors since I live in a condo.  I wasn't sure how the quality would be since I heard some people were telling me that wireless phones generally have low sound quality. But after using the headphones for 2 weeks, I absolutely love it. It works fine with my Sharp 60&#34; LED TV.  In fact, I don't feel any drop in sound quality by using this wireless headphones.  I would definitely recommend it if you live in apartments or condos."
RAJWOO8P1AIZ1,4,These headphones are the best!!!  Very comfortable and the sound is crystal clear!!  I can watch TV while my wife sleeps peacefully!
R1TOSO3R3HFK1,5,I am amazed at the clarity of speech on TV that I experience with the Sennheiser headphones.<br />I can watch dramatic programs and understand the dialog!
R2M1U2G4GVRU41,5,Hearing is a problem in old age and it keeps my wife happy when I don't have to have the volume up so high.
R1VBV8H84XIU95,5,I read all the reviews on this product before I purchased it and decided to try them. I was not at all disappointed with my purchase and how nice it is to be able to hear what is said without making everybody else suffer with the sound up so loud. Once again thanks Amazon for prime
R13FHIH10CSANA,5,"Best wireless earphones ever. Highly recommend these for dynamic sound. They even work to wear into another room or out to get the mail while the television is going. We've had these for two years now, and they still work like new. Recharge quickly, too."
R3LRXGNAHYSS5W,5,I like it well and it does a  good job. I use it because my wife likes to sleep with no sound in the room and I like to fall asleep watching tv. Negative is that it is pretty bulky if you use it while laying down and youhave to unplug the wires from tv to go back to regular listening to tv. Otherwise the product does what its intended to do.
R25K2FGVYRWQ1K,5,"This unit works very well. I use them to listen to the TV and music without bothering the better half. One caveat order from sweetwater much better service with warranty included and no sales tax 79,95 period !"
R2TSC33R82SBHM,5,"outstanding freq range and clarity.  headphones do clamp over ears a little too tight,  out performed my old set which I discarded"
R1FLXEKN5K2UPY,5,"This is a wonderful piece of equipment.  The sound is excellent and it has an exceptionally long range.  I had it in my den at the front of the house and could go all the way to the back end of my yard to my garden and the sound still was good. The headband is a little too large so that it keeps slipping off your head if you lean a little<br /><br />That said, it stopped working June 12th.  The return window was June 10th.  A real bummer because it was more than satisfactory up until then.  I gave it two stars because I love its range and sound quality.  Now I'm afraid to buy another one.  Guess I'll check out other options.<br /><br />Oooh!  I owe Sennheiser a huge apology!!  The problem wasn't with the headphones, it was cockpit trouble.  They work just find and I'm more in love with them than I was before.  If you want headphones which allows you to listen to television from a long way, these are the ones."
RCW7206NZYXRW,2,Very difficult to get clear reception
R1JT1KP84F8MP6,5,"Wonderful stereo sound.  Great product! Sound was not degraded any where in the house, even in the garage,<br />However, the headphones made my ears sore after about an hour and a quarter."
R132V0CUKI5FF7,5,This is the 3rd Sennheiser wireless headphone that I have purchased. The headphones deliver clear sound and are very comfortable to wear. This model includes a rechargeable batteries. Great product!
R20LAPKIVF9OO1,5,"This is the 3rd pair I have ordered for my husband. 1st replacement. He has them upstairs in bedroom, great for me and in den area. They are perfect."
RXRK6XP4FGXDM,4,"These headphones are awesome. I don't have to worry about charging them as its stand is a charger! Also, it works throughout my entire house (and maybe even further). so the range is great.<br /><br />I almost returned these when I first got them because I thought they were bad quality. There was bad background static.<br />If this happens to you, this means that you are hearing interference from your electronics. Luckily, there is a nice switch at the bottom of the stand that changes the transmission frequency. Chances are, one of the three will give you a better experience.<br /><br />Sadly, my dog broke the RCA to 3.3mm adapter. So, I guess that could be a con. The adapter is somewhat bulky, but it is high quality. I have been unable to find a decent replacement. The cheap ones are terrible."
R3EICFUOX07RVQ,5,"Purchased this for my 93 y.o. hearing impaired mother, after a disappointing experience with a cheaper brand.  So far, it has worked great and is easy for a non-technophile to use."
R2M7EME50P0LUQ,5,"Good sound quality.  Comfortable on the head and can walk around our house and still hear the TV.  Probably could go outside, but haven't tried it.  It is easy to recharge, just by hanging it up on the stand."
R1V8DYHCPDH0T8,4,Works as stated.  Charges easily and is comfortable to use.  Highly recommended for you use at home or with children on a trip.
R1QR3MW5FQ6TSM,2,"I have two of these for my father who has hearing loss.<br />I purchased this refurbished one because the first one worked pretty well and the price was right.<br />There is a hum that will not go away no matter where you sit, how you tune it or what volume you play it at.<br />I thought it might be the rechargeable batteries that came with it, so I purchased appropriate new ones, charged them up and the same thing."
R22SMRRP8EN6JE,5,The headphones are easy to use and I can wear them all over the house and not miss anything that is going on the TV.
R1KL2WJZR6ZK1D,5,I am hard of hearing and was constantly getting yelled at for the tv being up too loud.  My wife bought me a pair of these and it changed my life for the better.  I had to buy an audio splitter box for my TV and HD Recorder so I could listen to movies as well as the TV but this was well worth getting...
RC3IKDBBY1VRL,1,"I have loved sennheiser products. I think if it weren't for dealing with interference, these could be a decent product. However, if you are in any environment with any type of wireless interference, these will degrade the audio to the point of not even being worth listening to. Tuning can only bring the hiss to a lower level and not by any means make it unnoticeable. I am by no means an audiophile, but these are unacceptable."
R1EOQRBCO7EVD4,5,Looking for wireless headphones for watching TV and not bothering rest of the family with loud volume.  These work great.  I can walk to either end of the house and still hear loud and clear.
R3JDJFZHPO9QA1,5,"Clear, distinct sound. well worth the money, I can have the volume on TV at a normal level!! Thank you,"
R1CVJIBV6FJP8E,5,"I have 40% hearing loss in both ears and these headphones are like having it all back again! I've owned my present system for 5 years and use them daily for all my computer and movie viewing needs. I can move about uninhibited by cords while I gather up laundry, make a sandwich or check out the sunset. Clear sound and volume adjustment right on the headset, lightweight and easy to use. Neighbors don't hear a blasting stereo or TV, and neither does any guest in my house, when I use them.<br /><br />My only desire might be that they come out with ear buds that accomplish the same great sound. I'll buy a backup set in case anything happens to these, but 5 years of constant use they still hold on the head nicely with perfect sound."
R2Q0633MTKG4NE,5,"Got this for a Christmas gift  for my husband.  He is a fussy guy too and he really uses it and likes it.  I love it because I don't have to hear tv when I want quiet.  I called Sennheiser company who helped tell us what was compatible with our tv, and then we purchased the correct headphones from Amazon.  A really good product that anyone would like.  I got this because I like the quality, It is made sturdy and not flimsy, so it should last a good while."
R1WPICZB3QD3QE,5,Sound quality is exceptional!  I researched ratings/info on numerous headphones for 3 months.  The Sennheiser RS120 kept coming up as the star product.  I expected a lot but our experience has far exceeded this.  The sound is wonderful stereo.  My husband no longer asks me to repeat what was said since he can hear the dialog not being disturbed by background noise.
R7X217XVHZ448,4,"60$, refurbished is a good price. Sound is good in the mid-high range, however lacking bass...entry level Grados sound much better, although they're wired.<br /><br />There's a considerable amount of hiss, but I don't mind it- unless you mind white noise. Its only noticeable when no sound is playing.<br /><br />Con: I don't like how the headphones turn off after a mere minute of no audio playing. After a minute there's loud static that you often don't anticipate, that scares the **** out of me.<br /><br />Overall good."
RQIUQG2BX6R96,5,Awesome headphones
REQYKFA83M3U2,1,"Don't understand how it can be so highly rated and have such &#34;deal breaker&#34; problems. For me the deal breakers were:<br />1. It has a tuning knob on right side facing back of your head. The knob is right below the volume knob, so you will accidentally mess it up frequently. And bigger problem for me, my primary use case is sleep on the couch and watch TV. The tuning knob kept touching the pillow under the head.<br />2. It's auto of feature. The transmitter switches off if there is no input for a short time. Causing the headphones to blast out ear shattering shrill noise viz. audible in next room!! Practically this happens when I pause the tv to make a drink in kitchen.<br />Other problem, might be specific to mine, it never worked properly. Always has hiss, screeching beeps etc. But the earlier problems were the deal breaker.<br />Arrived 2 days later than estimate."
R3VKEKKHJZEDUN,5,"i bought this for my mom as she has hearing loss in one ear. When she's visiting relatives, she takes it along and connects it to any of out TVs so she can hear the audio. It works really well and she had no difficulty understanding how to use the tuner on it. Great product!"
RXNVK82EXY1HS,4,"no static, clear sound,even the fart sounds come thru clear as a bell.mine has smellavision,you hear a fart& you smell freash s***!!"
RNBWSVW95HYP6,5,This is our second one for second tv.  My husband loved the first one so much that I got another one.
R3ACF6WZX7QPSN,5,I have several of these wireless headphone products and all of them  were worthless.  This product works great and solves the problem of hearing without blowing everyone else out of the room.  This product really works.
R3I7GZWYS4M2OO,5,I love these head phones I was very pleased with the sound and volume control. There is no way you can go wrong with them for the price and the way they perform.
R34E5QT2SLYCKZ,5,"These are a great option for anyone who needs headphones for watching TV.  In my case it was so I could watch TV in the middle of the night without disturbing others in my apartment building.  These headphones are simple to set up and connect to your TV or cable box, the stand is small and un-obtrusive, the headphones fit comfortably and have crisp sound. And I can walk anywhere in my apartment and the reception doesn't break up.  If you're looking for studio-quality headphones so you can have a theater-like surround sound listening experience these may not be the best option, they do not have great bass sound and the treble sounds are just a little bit thin.  But if all you need is to hear dialogue and regular sounds from a TV show these will do great.  My only concern, which time will tell I guess, is how sturdy they are and how long they will hold up.  They feel a little flimsy compared to my Sony stereo headphones.  Overall, a great value for the money."
R2DKFW3GHTZ8Z3,5,"Having had experience from this type of remote headphones, roughly 25+ yrs ago & had pretty good luck with them, I had a need for this type of headphones. I LIKE THEM !!! Doing yard work, as much as 300 yards away from the house now, like I have to do, this product works out better then expected & would highly recommend this product to others. Easy hook-up to power, ease of use above standard, Excellent product !!! Thanks Amazon for selling them."
RO7MLANCIUH8K,5,It's amazing how they get surround sound into headphones.  It eliminates all other sound when I have them on.  It's better than being in a movie theater.  The wireless connection is great too... you can walk into other rooms in the house and it sounds exactly the same as when you're sitting in front of the TV.
RE3WHSONFXKKJ,5,We are very pleased with the wireless headphones.  They work very well and are reasonably priced.  This is the second pair of them we have had.  We had the other ones (and still have the actual headphones and they still work with the new charger - now we have two sets of headphones) for over 6 years.<br />We would recommend them to anyone and actually have.<br />Thanks for sending them promptly.
R2RP4FVSIEQFQX,5,"We have a set at our vacation home because the walls are thin and I am a bit hard of hearing.  I can wear them while others listen to a lower TV volume than I require.  But I also can wear them with the TV muted and still hear my show through these earphones.  So great if family or a room-mate is sleeping or otherwise need quiet while they engage in other activities.  The rechargeable batteries last for many hours, even over several days.  Very comfortable and not too heavy."
R1WA5SRICDZR7X,4,"I've had this headset since 2011, and it still works as well now as the day I bought it. I haven't had to replace the battery or the charger, they still charge just fine and keep the charge. The sound is extremely good, there's excellent bass, and it's very crisp and vibrant. The battery life is exceptional as well. It will last me all day and then some. The wireless has a very large range, sometimes I'll even take it outside while I'm doing yard work. It's very light and comfortable, many times I forget I'm wearing it. Unfortunately, the fit is a little loose, so if you lean forward, it has a tendency to slide off. Otherwise, it's a very sturdy, high quality headset with some of the best sound I've heard in headphones.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give it five stars, however, is the somewhat annoying tendency for it to suddenly burst into static if you leave it idle without listening to anything for too long. I can't tell you how many times I've watched a video on youtube, then when it was done, wandered over to read an article or something, only to jump in surprise when static suddenly bursts in my ears after five minutes or so. Like I said, I've had this head for several years, and I've actually purchased a few others in that time, as I dislike the static. Every time, though, I've come back to this one after only a month or so. The battery life and sound has just been far superior to other headsets I've tried."
R3N904MMS6E811,5,"My husband has had to turn the television set up and up and he was still missing out on half the words and what was going on in a program.  With this set, he hears every word and he really likes how the music set to the show is in the background."
R31MJOSEXDQ0S7,5,These were purchased to replace the same item after several years of use.  It allows my husband and I to listen to TV at our own comfortable volumes.  Charging cradle makes it easy to use.
R3C8PZAOYHQKHB,5,I got these for my elderly mother who is in a nursing home and is hard of hearing. The sound is good. Wish she would give them back to me! LOL
RSDE3ALKN157Q,1,not as clear as i had expected. there seems to be a lot of distortion in sound even though I'm sitting right in front of the cradle
R1CAL4F96MFQXY,5,"I bought these headphones so I could watch television late at night in the same bed  as my sleeping wife.  She does say the light does bother her quite a bit still, but there is nothing I can do about that.  The headphones can fit my big headed 3 year old and also my rather large cabeza.The bass is good enough,but my work in other rooms and that's extremely cool to me for some reason.  It took propably 20 minutes to<br /><br />I would buy these again, no doubt. The ear screen comes off kind of easily but no bid deal at all.<br /><br />I love this set of headphones.  I'm a mobile DJ so I've listened to a few different headphones.  These sound excellent!"
R2P1BCZC679QHZ,5,The ability to hear is great.  This is my third set of tv hearing devices and it is by far to best on I have had.  I would recommend Sennheiser Wireless RF Headphones to everyone.
RX72K4WZK4VDV,5,"After reading several of the feedbacks I was afraid I too would have a negative experience. However, I'm very pleased with my purchase. I placed the charger away from anything metal and that took care of the humming. The sound quality is good enough for me and with a little tweaking of the tuner I get all the bass I desire. I believe that with a little more familiarity I'll be quite comfortable with the placement of the tuner and the  volume control. I think this is a great product for the price range."
R1HEWIB4675GM5,5,I love the end product once I got it all figured out. The sound is stellar! It took me a little to figure out the connection to my TV and the Sennheiser website helped the most for that. I did have to buy extra connections that I wasn't planning on but in the end it was completely worth it.
R2UXBCF388EKCD,5,"These headphones are crystal clear, easy to hook up and the charge lasts long enough to enjoy watching tv for the night.  They are also very comfortable and the range is adequate.  I've tried and owned others, and between the hissing, crackling and momentary loss of signal, I was hesitant to try another set.  Glad I did, these headphones are awesome, and I cannot say anything else about these other than to buy it, you won't regret it."
R2NC9KOE8VIFG6,1,Subject line says it all and don't even think of going to the Sennheiser site for support - very unhelpful and will return this product to them via Amazon.
R3QIOHKPC7PK4M,5,comfortaable and easy to use.  put you tv on mute or you may get an echo--some do and some don't<br /><br />great buy
R1PRJ6AQ59WEDT,5,My second one... works perfect... new ... just the box looked recycled. No other product works as good in this price range
R2E73JKVGB09MC,5,Works perfect for my 86 year old father being hard of hearing.<br />My only complaint is the tuner dial is below the volume control.  This caused problems being found out of tune on occasion.<br />Quick fix:<br />Metal duct tape over knob to keep his big fingers from bumping the tuner dial.
RI3LHIGJXNSDV,5,my mom is starting to loose her hearing and these headphones work great!  She doesn't bother anyone and she can hear clearly every word that is said.  Highly recommend and would buy again.
R1UBVJ2BLABUYS,5,The wireless headphones are wonderful.  They are clear and without static.  It's even more wonderful that my husband<br />can listen to his ballgames and I don't have to hear them.  I  wish I had gotten them 20 years ago.  Now I can't do without them.
R33IFFLP8BXUS7,5,I purchased the Sennheiser phones to replace some Rca phones and my original TV ears. They were recommended by the tech rep that was trying to help me troubleshoot the others. They work great.<br /><br />I'm still awaiting my refund for the RCA units sent by Zento. I've returnrd the two unsatisfactory units.
RVZ402OU7YQWO,5,Excellent! I use it with hearing aids and it is better than the expensive alternative with a loop around the neck...which broke after about two years for no reason.
R17JIV8MYE2EII,5,"We re-did our den as a sort of man cave, with a huge flat screen TV and a beer fridge, but we didn't add a door, so these headphones serve a very useful purpose. My husband can hear all those football games perfectly, and my daughter and I don't hear them at all. He says he hears things through the headphones -- like background noise in the squad room, when watching Law and Order -- that he never heard before. He can also still follow the game when he goes to the kitchen for something to eat or even when he gets the groceries out of the car in the driveway. Best gift idea ever!"
R1U2P3P04BT74T,4,"Had the Sony Wireless Headphones that fell apart rather quickly, Bought the Sennheiser's and the sound quality is good also easy installation."
R3FLFDXK1ZOMEY,5,"The device does everything as advertised. A minor installation problem was well managed by the telephone support. The unit is a bit bulky, but no more than any well functioning headset. I recommend it without hesitation."
R1GUVITKSQ5KW7,4,"Have had these a couple of months. I purchased them because my husband goes to bed early some time and you can clearly hear every word on the TV. They do the job, but I do find you can't walk around and look down, they will slip off and a little tight on the ears after wearing for an hour, would have like them to encircle the ear instead and that might have solved the slipping problem too."
R18EBIB02XLX2P,3,Bought for my mom for mothers day because she liked my set when she visited me in New Jersey. I personally did not like the radio frequency tuning but when tuned it worked very well. I called her a few days after she went back to Texas and it was simple for her to hook up as she is 80 years old and her comment was &#34; I love them &#34;. She cannot hear the flat screen TV so I gues between yorr headphones and me we solved her problem.
R1OJLKHFP0ANF7,5,The sound is clear. No distortion or noise even when walking outside the house. Easy setup. Plan on getting a second set just so I don't have to share this one.
R34BW21LBRB4KK,5,He loves them.  He can hear and I am not blasted out of the room.  We can both watch TV at a comfortable volumne.
R1UL01ETX4QEWA,5,"Got these for my mother-in-law who is nearly deaf.  Watching tv with her was becoming an issue because for her to hear the tv, the volume was almost unbearable for me.  Now she is able to enjoy shows without having to read all the closed captions.  We can also spend more time with her while she is watching the tv."
R16GMF86OAPPU7,5,I've got one of these on three different TVs. They last forever. I just love them. I even use them when I watch TV with my wife. They simply make it easier to hear dialogue.
RG5Q2JKVJ9V8N,5,Bought these for a lady that is hearing impaired. In order to hear the TV the sound had to be on high volume. The rest of the family had trouble hearing their shows. These headphones have solved the problem so everybody is happy. The headphones work great plus very easy to hook up. I would give them 6 stars if it was available.
R38RZ64NIV1ROX,5,Using the earphones will eliminate the need to ask your wife to turn the TV up again. I like the fact you are able to leave the room and still hear the audio on the TV.
RPPHF7EHG2W2B,5,"I have been having a very difficult hearing the words on many TV shows, streaming videos and DVD's. With these headphones I can almost always clearly hear the words. I can even go out to the kitchen for a snack with the headphones on and continue to hear the program. My life has gotten better with these headphones."
R33UF43JZ6S6V5,5,Easy to set up..<br /><br />Good price.<br /><br />Very good sound.<br /><br />I have recommended them and I know three other people who purchase them
R14ZI0NYIPHPBL,5,Bought this for my father who won't admit he can't hear and he loves it. Easy to install on their tv.
R1D0J6Q5JW3AW1,3,"The product came on time and seemed to work but because my mother and I are elderly, we could not get it to work at all.  This is obviously our problem with wireless technology.  Sennhiser folks did not include instructions or a manual but when I contacted them, they sent one which was nice.  However, ultimately I could not make it work so they let me send it back in their 30 day refund policy window,  My only complaint is that they made me pay for shipping so it costs me 16 dollars to send it back which they should have paid for."
R7KUIPUT9WN95,5,"These head phones work great. They are not the most comfortable headphones that I own, but they do what they were intended."
R1YZZS5T3KQIC,5,"My cousin had one, I was very glad that I bought one too. I would recommend on buying this one."
R1PISUBE87MPPZ,5,"Wife watches \\""her shows\\"" on the 32\\"" LCD in the adjoining eat-in kitchen, I watch loud movies in the LR on the big screen with the surround sound audio.  Needless to say, I have to turn my stuff down. NO MORE!  Rather than buy a new set-up and renovate the downstairs, I paid $105 bucks for this beauty.  Wife: \\""We should have done this a year ago.\\""<br /><br />I was uncertain how I was going to integrate this with my existing Sony Sound Bar system, but you don't have to.  The external sound system audio level is off (but the unit is on), and the audio is supplied to RS120 via an audio L/R output from the TV. Since you have cable, ROKU and Blu-ray input (video and audio) to the TV via HDMI, you are all set.<br /><br />The instructions are cryptic and minimal, but it's easy to figure out.  Everything is supplied in a very nice package.  The unit is attractive and nicely designed.  Oh, and the audio quality is awesome BTW.  Happy camper."
RCJOUVGQHASQT,5,We got these when our baby was born. These have revolutionized our TV watching. Loud show/ movie at 10pm in a smallish house?.... no worries! We got a second pair shortly after. Don't forget to turn them off after use! Seriously great purchase for us.
R3TYAY902J0VI6,3,"Decent headphones.  There is a hiss, which is normal at higher volume or wireless headphones.  It's also a little tricksy to get them situated so they're comfortable, but it is usually possible."
RVQ19NTUZP29J,5,These Headphones are the greatest. Love that they have a rechargeable stand and the ear piece is very comfortable. They are well worth the price.
R17QD17JEQ7KRF,3,"Before I bought this, I thought that it would work great with my LED tv, but it was really difficult setting it up. It took about 15-30 minutes to figure everything out. Luckily, we have DirectTV, which made connecting this headphone a lot easier. I would not recommend this for a regular TV that just uses an antenna. I like the charging cradle though because my headset is always charged when I need it. I also know where my headphones are at all point in time."
R1D0GFWCEMGE9B,1,"Although there were quite a few one star reviews for this wireless RF headphone, my past good experience with other Sennheiser products lulled me into ordering one. Bad decision! Apparently the excellent quality of older Sennheiser items made in Germany has not been kept in the current Chinese-made Sennheiser headphones. I installed it in accordance with the written instructions and all I got was static in all three switch positions. The only thing that worked was the volume control. I could adjust the static from barely audible to very loud. But who wants to listen to that spectrum of noise? Amazon was very good about authorizing its return for a full credit and I have ordered a Sony wireless headphone that in all probability was made in Japan and will perform as it should."
RJT4SBSGGRBW8,2,"Lose power all the time,not happy with this product ! Dont know if it still has warrenty. The power goes off and may come back on for a while."
REIHYT2GRF8CW,5,This headset is great! It allows everyone that is not hard of hearing to listen to TV at the volume at a lower level.
RANQYMETWB9MU,2,"Good quality in appearance etc. easy to setup but have had problems with them working correctly. Lots of background noise (a hiss and fade in and out, very positional). These are being used in a 13 x 16 bedroom and just don't function correctly for the price. Will continue to try to resolve these issues but if unable to resolve will return them for the reasons listed above. Disappointed so far, hope things work out."
R21I1RNNOPH680,5,My husband is listening to the news and I can work in the kitchen/great room without listening or bothering him.
RJQ5QJZXOOHX9,1,"This things don't work do not waste your money, tried to hook up to my TV however couldn't get them to connect also battery don't last long."
R13UQ7KJUJ5EK5,5,"My husband goes to bed later than I do and likes to watch tv, these earphones keep us happily in the same room at night. I sleep and he watches tv and I don't even hear it."
RFTAACJAZDCOH,4,"These headphones are exactly what I wanted to go with my TV. The sound is excellent in mid range, and adequate elsewhere. They do an outstanding job boosting movie dialog. I think they are less well suited for serious musical listening, though, as I have found their performance not to be so great on complex symphonic pieces, but it's hard to sort out defects in the program material from what the headphones may be doing. I didn't buy them for that use, so it's not a big problem for me, but I did notice it. They are comfortable to wear for long periods and are very, very easy to set up.  I have not noticed any of the &#34;hiss&#34; others have reported, though if you turn on the headphones without any input to the base transmitter, you will hear hiss. Base is not super strong, perhaps because of the over the ear vs. around the ear design. OTOH, probably they are more comfortable long term than around the ear models which tend to be heavier.  Since they are analog, there is no audio delay, and you can watch TV with the speakers enabled without an echo effect.  The only other negative is that they don't give the impression of being super high quality. They are pretty light (good), but don't give off any kind of expensive product aura. That's balanced by the fact that the price is right."
R38B938HG3S7JP,1,"I followed the instructions to the letter. Everything was fully charged, but I simply could not get a signal no matter how hard I tried, and trust me it was for hours. I couldn't get them to work with TV, Cable or Home Theater. Maybe I was unlucky and received a defective product, but I'm not going through all that again."
R3MHDOCCHIDLD5,4,"The RA120 on ear wireless headphones are AWESOME. The sound is amazing. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the top on the earphones, that sit on your head, are not adjustable. Every time I bend my head down, my headphones fall off. The other thing is the arms that hold the ear pieces are pretty tight. I wear glasses and after awhile, my ears are sore. But the sound is worth the pain. If we watch a program live, I take the ear phones off during the commercials."
R1EHM1VMSNBDKI,4,THE ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE IS THAT THE EAR PHONES COULD BE LARGER IN ORDER TO FIT OVER THE EARS BETTER.  THE FUNCTIONALITY MEETS MY EXPECTATIONS.
R27WBCPYH2H4K1,5,It works well and the sound is much better than the TV speakers. It works anywhere in my house and most of my yard.
R2BYTZJNCZSZB3,5,"I have been using these with the TV for listening late at night when the wife is in bed.  I am very demanding on my listening quality, yet I find these very enjoyable for the money spent.  Reproduction of the audio spectrum is better than average, with very little background noise.  My new TV only has  Optical Digital outputs, which i ended up having to purchase &#34;Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adapter&#34; for under 10$ on Amazon.  Make sure you get an active converter which requires you to plug into the wall.  The passive ones will not be suitable for good sound quality and/or will not work altogether. This device saved me almost 300$ on purchasing a new Wifi headset with Digital inputs.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED:  Purchase yourself some better quality batteries to extend your listening time.  I use 1000 Mah Tenergy AAA batteries.  This gives me on average about 20 hours of listening time before I have to flip them out.  I also have a quality Nimh charger that will fully discharge and Charge my batteries.  I just keep switching them out as needed."
RIN0CHQBIH4NT,3,"Works most of the time.  Sometimes just doesn't give any sound from the earphones though.  Really sucks that that happens, probably gonna buy a different one instead"
R1RK2MAUWNH6XC,5,I can't say enough good things about the product. It exceeded my expectations. The entire purchase of the product was top shelf... Thanks so much to everyone...
R1FBX86EC8S55R,4,"Wonderful sound transmission with these amazing headphones!  They easily connect to the L/R audio plugs on the unit you want to monitor.  However, they will not connect to the modern units that only have digital connections or HDMI connections for monitoring the audio.  They would be perfect if they had a selection of connection ports to adapt to these different configurations."
R10VD40VZ39UJQ,1,"I never got as far as hooking up the headphones and listening to them, so I can't comment on their audio performance. All I know is that within 5 seconds of putting them on my head, they fell off. The ear pads are extremely slippery, and the headphones are very bulky, and the slightest tilt of the head sends them slip-sliding away. What good is good sound if they're impossible to wear comfortably?"
RTH6C6XVH8Q6H,2,I have to buy an analog adapter to use this on a two-year old TV.  Sucks.Sucks. Sucks. Sucks.This thing. Keeps asking for more word for this review.
R2CEMH9B97T69Q,5,Everything as expected. Quality is great and it works just perfect. Defenetily recommend this product! Sound is amazing! Love it!
R39KSZRXWE1LSI,4,"This is a first impression based on a lot of use in two ways for about three weeks. One purpose was to use the headphones to enjoy Sirius received via a computer throughout a medium size apartment. The other was to watch TV and be free of the varying clicks, pops, and hisses that I have dealt with for years with my otherwise excellent Sony headphones.<br /><br />From a reception and sound quality point of view, the 120s far surpass the Sony wireless phones. No noise at all when watching TV and excellent sound. Excellent sound when using the computer to enjoy Sirius as well. No interference anywhere in the apartment.<br /><br />The downside, which could prove to be significant, is fit and comfort. The headband is adjustable, but I have yet to find a position or adjustment I could really call \\""comfortable,\\"" and they tend to slip around. The Sony's were far more comfortable and stable on the head -- if you could stand the unpredictable clicks, pops, and hissing. In the end, sound is the key feature and the Sennheisers have been great in that respect for three weeks. I hope to get used to the comfort and stability issues.<br /><br />I found them extremely easy to hook up to a Samsung TV.<br /><br />At first it can be a little tricky to get the headphones to sit correctly on the recharging stand so that recharging occurs, but that passed quickly. Probably due to the excessive simplicity of the headband, it can't detect whether they are on a head or not, so you have to turn the unit on/off manually with a switch on the left ear cup. Another minor annoyance.<br /><br />Another plus over the Sonys is tuning and reception. Unlike the Sony, there are no transmitter switch positions to set on the Sennheiser base, and no corresponding switch positions to set on the headset. All the tuning is done on the headset with a simple dial that works well. But since it's adjacent to a similar dial for volume, your finger will need to learn to remember which is which. If you can't hear anything or if volume is low, it can be either because the volume is turned down (obvious) or because the tuning needs adjustment (not as obvious).<br /><br />In some respects this should be a 3-star review because of the level of fit and comfort. But all of the performance aspects linked to sound are so good that it would be cheating the unit not to give it a 4-star rating."
RW229Q2ADBIGG,1,"Big mistake, I ordered two different headphones at the same time, when I tried the second one the  Snnheiser RS120 I discovered that the adapter is the wrong size for my TV and the weight for the attached connector is so heavy the single insert extender jack is too small adapter tends be pulled and not fit.  When I went to return it, I was one day late and could not return it.  I should have tried both in short order or ordered only one at a time.  Sennheiser is now off my list and I’m stuck with an unusable expensive item."
R3NROQGKWZ389H,5,My husband and I were always trying to control the volume on the remote for the TV. He wanted it loud and I didn't!! My sister told me about the Sennheiser headphones which she got for her husband. He loved them!  I ordered them and I think they have saved our marriage! They are wireless and have there own volume control! He sets the volume on the headphones and I can have a different volume on the TV!! We are both happy!  I have recommended them to other friends who are going to try them! Great product!
R15Q2Q5A3QQOJW,3,"Nicely made. Fit well. Slick base station charger cradle. I use them to listen to music at work (the source being my PC), and they're less than optimal for that purpose, for the following two reasons:<br /><br />1) I get clear sound as long as I don't get within four feet of my monitor, but I can't really read my monitor past three feet. This is arguably a monitor problem, not a headphone problem, but it is what it is.<br /><br />2) With no signal, the headphones emit full-volume static buzz. To avoid that (and you will want to avoid it), I have to start the music first, then turn on the headphones, and then start the song over so I can hear what I missed. And if I pause the music to take a coffee break, I have to turn the headphones off, so they don't start pitching static loud enough that my coworkers complain. And when I return, I need to remember to start the music first again, and then turn the headphones back on again (and rewind a bit again, if I care to).<br /><br />The static is not quite annoying enough to send them back, but it is enough that I wouldn't buy them again, or recommend them for this sort of use."
RHNRWTA3OLD2O,4,"Dad's old (and much less expensive) Radio Shack headphones broke and he needed a new set in order to keep the peace at home.<br />He spends a lot of time watching TV (What else is a 90 years old man with a bad back and having to use a walker going to do?), but has hearing issues. Since he and my mom live quite a way from the nearest Radio Shack, and will not do any ordering over the Internet, Mom asked me to pick up a pair for him. Since I didn't have time to make it to the Radio Shack, and not being skittish about ordering over the Internet, I started researching online. I can't tell you why I decided on this model, but it seems to have been a good choice. Dad is using them, and stated that he liked 1) the way they felt on his head, better than the older set, 2) the fact that he could walk to the kitchen, even the back porch, without loosing any sound quality, and 3) the tone quality. I tried them on today and every thing he said was true. I especially liked the sound quality. They were more than twice the cost of his previous headphones, but I think they are that much better."
R2GJXBNKZ8S0YR,4,"Great sound!  Headphones do fall off if you bend your head, but that's probably an issue for all over-the-ear styles."
RGSE2HOXM9E9Y,5,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this product because I am hard of hearing and my wife can't stand loud television. For this purpose, the product works even better than expected.<br /><br />However, I found some added bonuses with this product. I have a Samsung Smart TV and being partially deaf, I couldn't hear some sounds that I knew were occurring by reading the sub-titles. With these earphones, I was amazed to find I could hear sounds that even my very expensive, professionally fitted hearing aids couldn't pick up with the TV on full volume.<br /><br />When I bought this product, I was worried that I might have a hard time hooking it up to my Samsung SmartTV because the TV manual is rather shoddy in explaining the plugs on the back of my 60&#34; HD TV screen, which are difficult to get at once mounted. This worry proved to be well founded, for even searching the internet for an hour for help proved ineffective in getting the necessary guidance.<br /><br />However, fortunately, Amazon offered free technical support on this product for 30 days. I called them on day one and they were extraordinarily helpful. In minutes they were able to locate a diagram of the back of my TV, tell me which plug to use, and give instructions as to which adapter to use (furnished with the Sennheiser RS120), and it only took about 2 minutes to complete installation and have the ear phones working properly. To me, this service alone merits five stars."
R2NILPEYKH8F54,1,"These headphones are awful in every way. Horrible design, static loud and high-pitched enough to make my ears feel like bleeding, constant humming, as well as awful sound quality for its price. How did these horrendous, untested headphones get such a high rating? Anyone voting higher than a two should be ashamed of themselves."
R3P82VIHI5VFAY,4,"These headphones arrived today and I mostly very impressed. The sound quality is the best I've ever heard from wireless speakers. Both the headset and the base are reasonably attractive and seem to be pretty well-made.<br /><br />My only criticism is the fit of the headphones. They are &#34;over the ear&#34; headphones, but there is no indentation for one's ears. On most over the ear headphones, there is a space carved out in the foam for one's ears. In this case, the foam is perfectly flat so the headphones rest ON one's ears but do not fit AROUND the ears. The practical impact is that if one is walking around the house wearing the wireless headset and leans over to pick something up, they can easily fall off.<br /><br />It's sad because there is no reason for it, no cost savings to design the foam this way instead of the more common way. It's just sloppiness in design, and not being attentive to the needs to the user.<br /><br />I'll keep them, but like Steve Jobs, I'm aggravated by stupid design."
R2DEHOBLIYNUT2,4,"The headphones work well enough.  Easy to setup.  The only thing I don't like is when there's no sound coming in, I would hear some static/interference sounds.  So for use with a TV, you'll never have this issue.  But if you turn off the tv and still have these headphones on, just beware that you might hear some static/background noises randomly."
R2AOUZTQN09H9F,5,"Works great and husband can hear the TV and it is not blastingme out. Easy to adjust, recharge, and does not take up a lot of room. Easy to install"
R2Z7T0LHUSZFXE,4,"excellent sound quality and range.<br />only complaint is that they are somewhat hard to keep on your head. Based on price , sound quality, and range, I would reccommend"
RCVNGXS72RGJE,2,"This product worked great while it lasted, but just under five months of use, it died suddenly and I get nothing but static.  Considering that this product is something that is subjected to only very gentle use, there is no excuse for that."
R3J8SBYY9G9G44,4,"Significant other was never a sound tech - I was for a while. These have decent sound in the mid-low to high ranges. If you like only &#34;big bass&#34; (WT* does that even mean?) these are not for you - go with a wired pair from a hip-hop artist of your choice. For a wireless set of cans they don't suck, or make me not want to buy Sennheiser any more. If you just like loud they will make my old ears ring too!"
R1CX0DMOKNZW9O,5,Bought these because I work nights and hubby works days and I don't want to disturb him when I watch TV when I get home.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is amazing!!!
R38SIT0AGSYMOK,5,My husband is hard of hearing and for years has worn the TV ears when watching TV or movies.  The last TV ears we purchased were much cheaper in design and didn't last very long.  He decided to try the on ear headphones and these are fantastic!  They don't lose a signal when he turns his head or goes out of the room.  He can walk all over the house and even out side and still hear his programs.  He has been very happy with the way these work and they seal out any outside noises (like wife calling him to dinner!).
RBQOEGH3EJ7XH,1,"The unit did not work and, after consulting with your tech people, the unit was declared defective.<br />I returned it."
R3T49LYE25CH4,1,I love the idea of wireless connection and recharge cradle . I have had two of them and they don't work as promised. I returned them both.
R1YZELINPCUGXN,4,"It is excellent to me indeed but its instructions are poorly written that need improvement for clear and easy understanding -- if this is also good enough, Id give 5 stars."
RUYGQLPICW50W,5,"I can't believe I wasted money on the old TV ears technology....infra red and monaural.  These Sennheiser's are great.  Excellent sound quality and comfortable as far as headphones go.  I kind of wish they would have an auxiliary charging stand I could keep next to my chair. Yes, I am lazy.  Running a long audio cable to my chair from the TV would probably induce EFI or RFI hum."
R1JFL47V6NXA6X,3,"I like the sound and the stereo but I had a bit of difficulty trying to keep the sounds contained.<br />I use the earphones so my wife can't hear the TV, but should could hear it across the room.<br />The adjustment for the headset allowed me to give a number of positions, but didn't work still.<br />I had to return it."
R2LC9RGWR9PBCD,5,"I bought the headset for my wife,because she has trouble hearing and they have far exceeded my expectations!<br />They've helped greatly."
RJ3ZVL489WDPO,5,Excellent devise for those who are hard of hearing.  I can set the volume where I can hear and understand without disturbing anyone else.  It also helps to focus the sound into my ears rather than hearing the TV after it's bounced all around the room.  Well Pleased.
R2HAEF74M77P8S,5,My husband loves watching Tv with those headphones. He says he can hear every word on the background while watching sports and even listening to the announcements while doing other stuff being in other rooms. Very comfortable and has perfect wireless connection.
R2H9D8QVUA09AL,5,These headphones produce a clearer sound and are more comfortable than the TV ears headphones that I previously used.  The rechargeable battery  lasts a lot longer and recharging is much simpler than my old system.
R1B5DZX4FEQ70N,1,"I purchased these last August and immediately returned them because they didn't work.  I ordered a replacement and, 8 months later, they stopped working.  Amazon won't replace them, and so I'm out the money.  Bummer."
R11QGDIWXEJF20,5,"Due to ear damage while in basic training and lots of shooting sports, my hearing is very hard to improve.  After trying expensive hearing aids, I tried this style of hearing amplifiers.  I use them for not only hunting and shooting but also for better hearing in large rooms with poor acoustics.  Really improves my communications and awareness while in the woods."
R3D35YF1HGU8MB,5,These work PERFECTLY out of the box with NO issues!  Great sound at a great price. Buying a second pair for the den
R2I2WR33RMNM6B,5,I like this product. I am hearing impaired and they work very well for me. I would definitely recommend them
R11POV8C4VTYVX,5,"These headphones do everything that they advertise.  They provide clear, crisp, wireless sound.  Watching TV, in my house, has always required the sound turned up (because of my hearing impairment) or close-captioning, both of which are displeasing to my wife.  I have tried other headsets but this one provides the clearest sound.  And, being RF (Radio Frequency) I can go anywhere in the house or yard and still listen to my programs.  I can also watch TV while my wife reads, without disturbing her.  I would recommend these headphones to anyone."
R2SV9KRRH5B1WE,5,"This is a great wireless unit.  It took only minutes to connect (with an old tv connected to Dish Network) and my 88 year old mom could hear the TV clearly. The volume control on these headphones is independent of the actual TV volume, which is great for others in the room."
R1EFSA06COKIZZ,2,"I was very disappointed in the comfort and the quality.  I previously had a HDR130 Sennheiser which I was trying to replace, but there was not one listed as available.  I think I did pay more for the 130 and was willing to do so again."
R3IHJ87EUSOUDH,2,"the earphones themselves are FLAT and leave no room for the ear, so it makes it uncomfortable.  The model RS130, which was discontinued, has same quality plus &#34;hollow&#34; ears and I love it."
R3F6YH5K1S7ETP,4,"After reading all the reviews -- several times -- I decided to give it a try.  It works great!  I can walk from room to room and still hear the television.  I don't have any of the problems some of the other reviewers mentioned.  It was easy to set up even for a Luddite like me.  Took just 10 minutes.  If it weren't for the fact that the earphones are a little big and clunky, I'd have given it a 5 star rating.  I'm happy with the purchase."
RHM9P2ZSW20YC,5,"I've had mine for about a year now. I think I got them for Mother's Day last year.  They are truly AWESOME.  I'm beginning to lose some of my hearing, so these have kept peace in my home simply because the volume of MY TV is now almost mute! I also have never grab them from the charging station and them not work.  I watch hours of TV during tennis matches and not once have I ever had to 'charge' them.  Always ready when I am. I love these and am going to buy some now for my husband's TV, so I don't have to holler at him to turn his TV down!! Great product."
R1GQVS0YGP1J2P,5,I would give these headphones 10 stars if it were possible!  They truly are outstanding.  Previously owned '_ _  ears' to watch television while spouse wanted to sleep.  They would get fuzzy/static if you weren't directly in front of charger/stand.  Parts kept breaking and were expensive to replace so I selected Sennheiser based on the good reviews.  Soooo glad I did; I can go downstairs to the kitchen and still hear the master bedrm television clearly.  The sound quality is amazing through walls and floors!  Am thrilled with this product.  :-)
R244GEBPHHZG24,1,I had one of these for my Mom. So bought one for myself. Tried getting a &#34;like new&#34; set. Would not turn on. No power to it what so ever. VERY dissapointed. Am returning. Guess I will pay the extra $40 for a new one.
RBZJ1HT0D0HAO,5,These headphones work great and hold the charge for a long time. I have had them for several years and used them on several different TV's. I have them in my bedroom and can hear crystal clear all the way in the kitchen- about 50-60 ft away. great buy.
RCAXSOFBPVPY,3,"The device works fine once you get it connected. However, the RCA connectors did not work on our TV. The converter for going from RCA to 3.5 mm is too large, and doesn't work in the tight space for that connection on the back of our TV because the TV housing gets in the way. Luckily we could force it into the tight space and make it work. We tried a 3.5mm extension cord but that lost the stereo and switched it to mono so only one ear would receive sound. So we're making do with the tight connection. I still do not understand why the RCA connectors did not work, but the connection hassle made the whole deal less than satisfactory."
R2UZGE09V18ZRL,5,I really enjoy my new Sennheiser Headphone.Set up tool about 30 minutes. Tuning in was the hardest part of setup. They work just as they were described. Now I can watch the late shows in bed without distubing my wife.
R2DZ58TQPCGUQX,2,"Got these for $60 on sale, and it is surprising that such a well-known company would make a product with such design flaws.    Here are the good things:    1.  Batteries are replaceable and rechargeable.  2.  Sound is very good to excellent.  They sound better than my TV's speakers.  3.  Reasonably comfortable to wear.  4.  Nice charging station.    BUT    *  1.  Earphones are not cups.  They are flat and nearly smooth.  Do not bend forward or they will slip off.  Ridiculous.  One way to reduce this defect in design and manufacture is to reverse the phones.  They won't be flush on your ears, and they won't sound as good, but more pressure will be applied to your ears reducing the chance of them falling off.  Mine have fallen off many times from just looking downward.  The headband tension is unfortunately not adjustable.  The hand band thus could be too tight or too loose for some people.    *  2.  The flat foam covers come off too easily.  It's just a slight rotation and they are not held in tightly.    *  3.  On Off switch is too close to volume switch    *  4.  Although the range is about 150 feet, quite impressive, when going for than 30 feet from the transmitter there is a regular rhythm annoying chirp.  Fine tuning doesn't help.    *  5.  Sennheiser should have added a MUTE circuit.  If the earphones are turned on and the TV is not, there is loud static through the headset.    Sennheiser should redo the ear foam and provide free replacement units to all HDR120 users.  These are recommended for the sound quality and comfort.            ADDENDUM 11/27/14:   I'm on my third set of these headphones.  Got free replcements from the retailer.   The first Sennheiser set died, the second one had a frequency drift and was unbearable.  This third set still has the same stupid defect in design and manufacture - - - -  it falls off my head when I bend forward.  When this set dies, will upgrade to a Sony."
R11SNTSM0DITVW,5,This headset and charger are great! I was using some cheap ones and recharging batteries for them all the time. This one? Just sit<br />it on the cradle and it stays charged up. Great sound and clarity. Bass is a little heavy but I can live with that. I would say without doubt the best headset for it purpose and price going.
R216UOC5R6KP4I,4,"I would have given this product, but the headphones are a bit large, and fall forward if I tilt my head (Iam a woman but do not really have a small head.)<br /><br />It was a breeze to install, and I can move around the house, garage and small yard without any loss in sound quality.  I do not have to be sitting in front of the receiver.<br /><br />This product does not turn off the sound from the cable box when in use, which would be helpful if there are others watching tv.  Also, if you have a cable service which has different volume levels for different stations and the commercials, this levels everything out for you.<br /><br />My tv has terrible sound quality, which a flat tv is notorious for, and this has solved the problem nicely for a very reasonable price."
R23CH7QMV66FUG,5,"These headphones work. There is a tuning knob on the side of the headphones that you have to use to try to make the audio clear. My wife is the one that uses these, not me, but she says that sometimes in bed she has to have her head at the right angle or she gets a little bit of static. We're using these headphones with the Roku 1 HD."
RA58NUMLAEUBY,4,was really a great addition for my sons room...he has enjoyed it with his tower/ipod etc. a great product .
RCUT5487LNRB5,5,"I've had these for over a year and they are still awesome. I tried a couple of cheaper pairs and one that cost about the same but none were as good as these. The stand/charger is so convenient: you just turn them off and hang them on the stand. I've never run out of power with them. I've left them laying around not charging for several days and they still work great. I'm not sure what the max time they'll hold a charge but it's more than 3 or 4 days! The sound is very good quality, but they do have &#34;leakage&#34; - when you're listening to something loud others can hear it several feet away. They don't make you sweat though and I can wear them comfortably for a couple of hours, no problem. I wish I had gotten these years earlier: our house is small and it's a lot better than trying to listen with the sound down low and then still having the wife wake up and scream. I don't know if this saved my marriage, but it didn't hurt!"
R1XF04AZH4SC1N,5,Now I can listen to TV dialogue right in my ear at the volume I need while my wife can listen at the volume she prefers with the regular remote control.  I no longer say to her &#34;What did he say?&#34;  every few minutes because I can hear it now.  The only time I haven't understood something she didn't understand it either so it was something mumbled and hard to understand for anyone.  Much better listening and much more pleasant experience now watching TV together.
R1X2R5GTIRFARY,1,"I bought this set on March 3. I spent countless hours trying to get it to work and it would not! I wrote the company to get tech advise. They did respond and gave me steps on how to make it work. I followed the steps, but it would never work. I tried this set on my 5 different TV's. Didn't work!  I finally wrote the tech back and told him that I needed to just return the item and he wanted to do a couple of things; first of all he wanted me to call him during the day, of course, on HIS TIME! I work and my hours would not fit in with his time. I again repeated all of his steps to try and make the headphones work, but to NO AVAIL!!  I called today Sennheiser and they told me that I would have to return the set to Amazon. So I went to Amazon and saw where it WAS TOO LATE TO SEND IT BACK, SO NOW I AM STUCK WITH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK!!!!  VERY DISSATISFIED!!"
RSW43SDGGLW9F,5,"Love Love Love it  My husband wears this every night and we mute the TV so I can sleep.  You can go downstairs get a snack, sit outside, whatever and still hear and not miss a word. Has its own volume too!!!  Makes awesome shower gift for bride. Im getting a few for Milestone birthday gifts  10 STARS"
R1QVAAYUO5RKO2,2,"Since my others sennheiser ear phones got broken, I tried this new improved set.  It was a waste of money.  It was way too hard to adapt to my older tv."
R1IOCPAFFBC4D6,5,"I am not hard of hearing, but when I watch British shows (okay, any show with an accent) I have difficulty understanding them; it does not matter how loud I turn up the TV volume.<br />I put these on and it's like magic. I can discern the words without ear-blasting volume.<br />Regarding the use with hard of hearing however, my mother wakes up early, turns the TV up to 40 so she can hear it, and wakes me up.<br />These are easy enough that she understands how to use them, puts them on, I can get more sleep after watching British TV late into the night;)"
R39B6ONY4RH2DJ,4,"There was 2 sides to all of the reviews before I purchased... 1. Its not clear and sucks, 2. Its the best thing I've ever bought. Both answers are correct. If the transmitter isn't plugged into a place that the volume is loud, there's a crackle and some distortion. I've plugged into my Xbox 360, my TV, my tablet for music and also my PSP. They all work great as long as the volume is up! The best is through surround sound output or a portable device (tablet). I'm not as picky as many others but its perfect for what I need,<br />One suggestion would be to put the cradle over or under a TV, the TV distorts signal between headphone and transmitter! Hope it helps!"
RDH0SWQJYUZVK,5,"Hi. I ordered my headphones  because I am hard of hearing and wanted to listen to TV clearly. I had bad experiences in the past with TV Ears and wanted to get something of higher quality. I was extremely happy with how functional and clear these headphones are. The installation was very easy, and the daily charge time is outstanding.  I would recommend these to anyone wishing to obtain a quality headphone at a very reasonable price."
R1K2JOQ9Y5FRVD,5,"I bought this for my father in-law who hasn't been hearing his tv for years.  Big success, he is enjoying them!"
R1A28DAHPWZAJV,5,"Great Headphones, easy to set up, control, and use.  Comfortable and good sound from the TV.  Highly recommended this for the couple where one sleeps while the other watches TV"
RTJLPN9MT4D2U,5,"Work's good, has good transmitter distance. I can go all over the house and into different rooms with no fading or distortion, good product."
R2D6JCSJ5AMX74,4,"My only real problem with these headphones is that, although adjustable, they don't really stay put on my head; if I lean forward they can slide right off! I suppose the flip side of that coin is that they might otherwise be too tight, and of course they will fit everyone differently. I like the sound - some people refer to a background hiss associated with these and other RF headphones, and while I do hear something, I've adjusted to it and don't even notice it. The headset does get a little warm, too, but I've noticed this with every wireless device I've had in the past (headphones, cell phone, etc.). I also discovered that, with my TV, it's either the headset or the TV speakers - I'm not able to have both at the same time. That will definitely vary from TV to TV; maybe I have yet to figure out the settings on my Samsung, so don't quote me on this. ;)<br /><br />All in all, these are doing the job for me, and at an affordable price. As always, they arrived ahead of schedule from Amazon, and without having to upgrade to the expensive, accelerated shipping options (I always go with Standard Shipping, with speedy delivery every time). So, overall, I'm pleased with the purchase."
R2UFBP0NH2JFH0,5,My husband's hearing is somewhat impaired but not quite bad enough for a hearing aid. These headphones give great quality sound and we don't have to blast the volume. Giving it 5 stars because the sound quality is really nice. Only complaint is that the base hooks up to the back of TV or bluray so we have to pull out the TV to switch from TV to bluray programs. Bit of a hassle.
RD0KFCR3HT746,2,I bought an rt-130 back in 2004. It was refurbished Kept them for 10 years till the wires starting to wear. Those were the best wireless earphones I ever own. So I ordered rs 120. was that a big let down. 87.00 down the drain. finally I ordered rs170 better<br />but not as good and as comfortable as the 130's The leather ear pads make your ears sweat. the ear pads on the 130's go over the ear but are foam to let air in. My thought is when you have a good thing don't discontinue it.
R28WLLPTTXIFK,3,"The ear 'cups' are flat and press against your ears. For prolonged wearing (e.g. a movie) people with sensitive ears will not find these comfortable. For a Sennheiser product this set feels very plastic-y. Doesn't feel substantial. Sound quality is good for the price, but if you are sensitive to slight hiss then you may not like them. You can compensate for the hiss by making sure the input signal is strong enough that you don't have to turn the head phones up very loud. The louder the volume on the headset the more you will notice the ever-present hiss during quiet passages."
R3STLSTO8XRE9K,5,"After tedious research on the best way to make TV easier to listen to for an elderly deaf parent, I chose the Sennheiser RS120 for several reasons. One of the overriding factors was the Sennheiser name. This company has been making high quality studio sound equipment for decades. Some great new ideas may not pass muster once the items have some miles on them. Wireless was also a must. As much as lightweight earbuds sound like a good idea, quite a few of them had the wires and electronics either around your neck or dangling from the earbuds.  I considered comfort and breakage as being issues,  and have had personal issues with buds falling out or tugging on the wires while turning my head. Also, other good reviews by tech nerds were a factor in my choice.  RF rather than anything needing clear line of sight was the right wireless method. I put this headset on, and walked out of my mother's apartment, down the hall and around the corner to the elevator, and the signal remained as clear as a bell. The final proof was in my mother's reaction. She was like a kid in a candy store. She always had the volume of her TV on 100 (MAX), and still couldn't make out conversation. Now she says she can hear every word they're saying. The long battery time and the ease of charging by just hanging the headset in the cradle made the Sennheiser the best choice."
R2DYGDVJQCOYJN,5,Saved my hearing and my marriage. Husband uses all the time for the T.V.  Comfortable and easy to use. Simple hook-up.
RP1K6YF4D1DTC,1,No way to turn on and off.... had to plug and unplug.<br />Need to hear tv thru phones and normal tv speakers at the same time.
R33UBEHE1Y9M7E,5,Bought these as a gift for my husband and he says the sound quality is excellent.  They have a good range as well.
R1D308VTBPDLG6,2,"I love the set I bought several years ago which is still working well. I thought I'd get another set for an upstairs television, and so I ordered another set which I expected to be the same as the old. It was not. As far as I know the base is the same, but the ear pieces are not. Instead of a cushioned ring which surrounds your ear, and incidentally keeps it from slipping around, the ear pieces are flat and net covered. Not only do they slip, but they also are uncomfortable after a few minutes because of the pressure exerted on the most prominent places on the ears. I returned them."
RQQ6UEDHDT47Z,5,This unit went to work quickly thanks to the extra jacks provided.  Works great all over the house and really well on the exercise bike.  Clear sound and comfortable fit.  No problem tuning to signal. Worth the price for the quality.
R3BL44R6YMLEIB,5,"A wonderful telephone and the cost is wonderful. Have tried other systems and they don't compare in cost and performance. I am an 80-year-man and was able to set it up right away. Clear great sound. Can't imagine why anyone would not like this system. Unlimited local and long-distance service. I know there are other systems out there that cost more, but do not compare in quality. This breaks the adage that you get what you pay for. In rare cases you get more than you pay for, this is one of those cases. I pay only $3 AND CHANGE A MONTH IN TAXES and that is my only expense after the original cost. I don't think anyone can match that! Extremely happy with this product!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Allyn in Port Charlotte, Florida."
R13TFA633XKAPI,5,"My wife has lost maybe 50% of her hearing over the past year or so and I have been desperately searching for a product that would allow her to comfortably watch TV (Hear TV) without blowing out the Television or surround sound speakers.  I originally wasted my money on a competitor’s product; while it seemed to work for a while, it eventually quit working and I was told the version we purchased was an older version.  I then stupidly purchased the newest version of that product only to be disappointed for the same reason.  About three months ago I purchased this product (for about half the cost of the competitor) and have been simply amazed at the quality, range and performance ever since!  My wife can clearly hear the television and can wander throughout the house and still listen to her favorite show.  Shortly after the first few impressive weeks I purchased another set for our Bedroom; and was equally satisfied.  I can fall asleep and she can continue to watch-hear TV at her leisure.  My 78 year old mother visited a few weeks ago and she fell in love with the headphones and said she could hear the TV better then she had in years.  I quickly ordered a third pair for her for Mother’s Day!  I’ve been spreading the word at work and will endorse this product to whoever will listen!!!"
R3JFMTPCSLA3AU,4,Has good reception all through the house and even in the backyard.  Can use for several hours without are recharge. Good value for the price. I have used these for several years.
R2KCD0WUTC54GD,4,"These fit the bill when I want to continue watching TV at night and my spouse does not.  I can do so while he sleeps in silence.  My only complaint would be that they are quite bulky and while weight is not an issue, lying in bed as I am, it does prevent me from curling up with them on."
R2ADYUPWCTR98E,1,unit will not stay adjusted. If I put my hand near the ear piece it will go very loud.  Moving the base unit or changing channels does not help.
R2HOR4CVR51VBC,5,The sound is great and if you have someone who is hard of hearing this is the perfect solution. Got them for my dad for Christmas and he loves them (so does my mom!).
R1TDVJUS9T1NM6,1,"I simply didn't believe the bad reviews. &#34;It won't happen to me,&#34; I said. DO NOT BUY THIS. First off, it arrived just as I expected. The first problem was plugging in the power supply cord. I couldn't do it, but after some fiddling, my husband got it to plug in. The directions are all but useless. Then - it didn't work. I bought it so I could play my Tai Chi DVD at the office and (after closing the office door) spend my lunch time studying Tai Chi with Yang Yang. I needed to be able to move around, untethered to my computer and without disturbing anyone. I plugged it into my computer - nothing.<br /><br />So I waited for our IT guys to come out to our law firm. They spent a few minutes working with it, go it to work and then lifted the base unit one inch to move it slightly. And the whole thing cut off. Apparently it has a short in the base unit.<br /><br />I recognize that problems happen, but this is difficult to assemble, difficult to properly hook up to your computer (I used the trial-and-error approach, then when it didn't work, waited for IT), and finally, it turns out to be so shabbily assembled or uses such crummy parts that it doesn't work in any useful way at all. In other words, it's a POS."
RNN8V8X3ZRW9M,2,"Headset doesn't set firmly on my head and slips off easily. Affer two hours white noise interference detracted from music, batteries had been fully charged."
R1U6Y4VF77ML5H,5,"I have tried every type of wireless headphones for my husband who likes to watch sports on the TV. Finally I gave in and bought these, the type I should have had all alone."
R24Y3WA11EU0B8,5,I purchased these for my 92yo Grandfather who lives with us.<br />Before he would have his TV all the way up.<br />Now he just puts on the headphones and he is as content as can be.<br />They must be comfortable because sometimes he forgets he has them on.
R3VYBMBLCQVA0W,4,"Sound is very good. However, it would be a bit better with a different ear cup or material to better exclude ambient noise"
R1XGVNBHPXMWKA,5,"We had a problem with our TV preferences, and these wireless headphones completely solved that problem.  They are effective, comfortable, and are truly a quality product."
RRDAGQ39YSA1Y,4,Great fidelity and strong signal.  I am pleased with this replacement for a previous set of wireless headphones.  Recommend this product.
R30HAO8914U81C,2,Headset is okay. Low and high end of range is muted a bit much. Best for spoken word. I wouldn't call this a hi fidelity headset. If there is no input for about 30 seconds a harsh hiss comes on. Needs to have a muting circuit to stop that. Comfortable to wear. Charging cradle is easy to use.
R2QCB0XHKKIU5B,5,Not the fanciest Wireless RF Headphones around but work real well. I need them for working around the house and outdoors. Often using noisy tools and equipment. Do very well and have great range even into a detached metal garage. Rechargeable and never a problem with battery failure. If you ware looking for real high end sound reproduction you may be disappointed.
R3IVX9XEKAYCYU,5,"If you want headphone Wi-Fi for TV or any other device, this is for you! High quality German product is most impressive. One recommendation. The quick guide in English is in words, no illustrations and is almost worthless. Go to there internet site and view the installation video."
R2SVELT1MCQCIF,5,"I have owned these for about 18 months and I just love them! The sound quality is excellent, especially in the vocal register. I find them to be comfortable, even though I have a big head. I rarely watch TV for more than a couple of hours at a time, but even on the longest uses, they had no noticeable battery drain. The only very minor gripe would be that there can be static when I tilt my head down, but I can usually clear that up by fine tuning or looking in a forward direction generally level with receiver. These do fine when I go to other rooms or walk out to the mailbox - about 40 feet from the receiver.<br /><br />I like these so much that I am buying another pair for my bedroom TV!"
R3T47WM4HAEIYS,4,"I like the sound and wireless range/reliability of these, but I do not like the ear pieces.  These are not ear cups -- they're flat and just sit on the ear (instead of cupping over the ear).  This style pressed your ears against your head, which gets uncomfortable after like 30 mins.  I know this probably has a lot to do with personal preference, my ears, my head, etc., but I think most people would like the cup style of headphones better."
R23B4HPIXMS9GX,5,"My husband has a hearing problem and watches TV a lot with the volume blaring. I'm more of a reader and I couldn't concentrate even when I was on the other side of the house. When we DO watch TV together, with these wireless ear phones, we can both watch TV comfortably because there is an adjustable volume on his earphones and yet I can listen at my own comfortable volume by using the volume control on the TV remote."
R8057POT7FYFN,5,"My husband loves these and wears them even when I'm not in the room with a volume issue, as he can hear the tv better with them on.  They work great!"
R2WFVBNL6MK1XB,5,"What can I say, I'm very happy with it, and my wife, she<br />bought me a package of M&M. East to install, 2 hooks up only<br />and a rechargeable battery, you never have to remove, just<br />hang the head set on it's support and your done.<br />william"
RWWC4ZF1N4KMP,5,"Hubby loves it, he uses daily. Works well even in another room. My siblings have them too. Great gift idea"
R3HFC01674AVSX,5,We bought this product about.18 months ago for my 94-year old mother-in_law.  She is quite hard of hearing and shares the home with her family.  The Sennheiser headphones have been in near constant service this entire and continue to work perfectly.  Everyone in the home are very grateful for Sennheiser!<br />Nathan
R16NFAY334N2MW,4,"These headphones are very well made and seemed to be the answer to our problem (husband no-hear/wife hear too much). Unfortunately we had to return them because we have a Plasma TV and these aren't compatible.  We had absolutely no problem with Amazon on the return, so will be shopping til we find the right one."
R1RBNA7D51GMP3,5,"These Sennheiser headphones are a marriage saver among other things.  I am older and need the TV at a little higher volume.  My wife likes silence and she goes to bed earlier than I do.  These headphones provide wonderful fidelity and allow me to watch my programs without bothering her.  They are very high quality.  I actually have two sets, one at each of our homes."
R3H0DKZAPFEMV0,4,LED LIGHT WORKS ONLY WHEN AUDIO SIGNAL IS PASSING THROUGH !! :)  and one more important future that nice to not have: person next to you can hear almost as good as you do :))
R1JFBNVRKLSOKA,3,I would have to agree with the other reviewers that this thing falls off too easily. I like to work in the kitchen and do things around the house and it just does not stay on. I have a rather large head so I can't imagine a normal head with these.
R1YMRORV1U2M9D,5,These headphones are a great buy. The sound quality is very good and the range is great. They last for at least 8 hours per charge.
R278EQ6IK72R4F,5,"I'm old, (70+) and I'm getting deaf.. My wife says I turn the TV up too loud, so I ordered these headphones. They work great! I can listen to TV with them (and actually hear what's being said) and she can read if she doesn't like fishing shows! &#34;Old Guys Rule&#34;!"
R2XNQDLBMF9TUZ,5,"I ordered this for my wife since she is extremely hard of hearing.  She didn't want them because they were too large and bulky for her so I took them for myself and am I glad she felt that way because I love them. They are larger than the TV Ears she uses but the quality (both sound and hardware) is far, far superior to her TV Ears.  I would recommend these to anyone."
RQO7MZEQDKW7P,5,"Considering the price, it was definitely worth it.  Works great with no issues so far.  May considering getting another for my wife."
R1ZK2G2JUTVBIE,5,"It's everything that the description states it is. My wife can have the volume on the TV as low as she wants, and I can crank up the headphones so I can hear and understand the dialogue."
RTDWPG7OSUANO,3,"1) they didn't fall off your head every time you moved;<br />2) you didn't have to plug them into the DVD player in order to hear the TV;<br />3) you could, again, actually plug them into the device--like a smart tv--you wanted to listen to"
R1D93JN0LLGSOJ,5,"I now have two set of these, the sound is amazing with good clarity and bass, I do not need to turn on my home theatre system or the sub to enjoy the thunder of good movies. The range is not great but I can hear my internet radio a couple of rooms away.<br /><br />The only thing I have noticed is I wear glasses to read and the headphones press against my ears and crush my ears into the part of the glasses that go behind your ear, this gets very uncomfortable very quickly. This might be common to people who wear glasses.<br />I got around this by lifting the glasses above my ears and them putting on the headphones so the headphone now traps my glasses to the side of my head a fraction above my ears, if you have ever seen the movie &#34;The Jerk&#34; I might end up cross-eyed for my trouble!"
RSI5DH5821YBY,5,"Headset works amazingly! If you take the one minute (literally) to tune it to the correct frequency, these work flawlessly.<br /><br />My boyfriend uses these in our room while I sleep. The range is approximately 25 feet maximum, and again,  they work flawless. We have yet to test them at greater distances.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: These work with gaming systems! As long as your television has an additional audio hookup, you can use these without switching to say... a turtle beach product."
R2F7Q5Y9VRWZQP,4,"After using TV Ears for many years, and going thru several sets and returning the headsets, we finally go t smart and switched to Sennheiser.  Theses have a much clearer and more comfortable fit than the tv ears.  I gave it a four instead of a five because it takes some getting used to hearing all of the detail music and background that you could not hear with the tv ears.  Great product."
R252Q73B6GSTZT,5,I got these for my Fiance so he could watch TV at night when I'm trying to sleep. He loves them and says the sound quality is great. He turns them up pretty loud and I still can't hear any residual sound escaping from the headphones. The charging base is very convenient and easy to use.
R196KO0J1IXQ5O,5,"Both my wife and myself enjoy the head phones completely, my wife uses the head phones to watch tv when she does wear her hearing aids and is completely satisfied and I enjoy using mine for listening to music because of the great sound......"
R2BNVAH0U9977D,5,"These were a gift for my sister, her neighbors in her apt building complained of her TV being to loud so I purchased these for her and she absolutely LOVES them!!!"
R204NOY1OWWS9C,2,"First off, these headphones are &#34;on ear&#34; which means they do do surround the ear but sit on top of them. After about 45 mins my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headphones. You will hear hissing at low volumes during movies or TV shows. It's kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker. I returned this item because on ear headphones are not for me. I ended up buying the RS 180 off amazon and am very happy with the around ear design."
R3G8BLJE383EX6,1,"I have had a few people attempt to help me set this up. There is nothing in the directions that specifies how to trouble shoot. Because I did not try to set it up for about two months after receiving it, I had no recourse to send it back, but I have had these before and this by far is the worst operationally I have ever seen. I wish I could send it back and start over with a better p"
R2SQZQEH78J15N,4,"Wonderful sound, wish the head peace was seated on the head a little better, it feels awkward.  Love it! Keep it up!"
R14QT3YCKTAALL,5,"Works great at night.  It also helps a lot for those TV programs when the characters talk so fast, you just can't understand them.  The earphones clarify things  a lot."
RWBX3JSBLL68S,4,I am partially deaf and require this type of headphone for tv use. I have owned 3 other brands of wireless headphone and this is the best so far. Very Happy with these. Mark
R32PL7XTYR7K0U,4,My only criticism of the Product is the inconvenience of attaching the power cord.  But this is not a really big issue.  The sound quality is most important and it is quite good.
RO2SO42M3VBOF,5,she was listening to her TV too loud at night.  She's 90 and everything new needs to be simple and work without fussing. This hits the mark! Would buy again!
R3KGFQFVK0WSXB,5,"After buying the first unit for myself when I needed a second set the choice was simple, this is a quality piece and just as happy with the second set for the wife. She goes to bed and often watches a different program in the bedroom than I do in the family room. With the tuning knob it is very easy to listen to two different station with no conflict. If your looking for a great working headphone this is a great choice."
R3D249WURRASD4,5,"I ready countless reviews on these headphones not being what they wanted, or whatever. Listen, I have high taste and rarely pay for cheaper electronics because I have that mindset you get what you pay for. ESPECIALLY in electronics. But as I sit and type this I'm listening to music clear without hiss from DirecTV. If your looking for a set of wireless headphones that you can change the batteries and come with a charging cradle then look no further. Here's my top thoughts.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Great Sound<br />2. All around comfortable fit<br />3. Easy to set-up<br />4. Easy to adjust sound settings<br />5. Can hear in other rooms.<br />6. PRICE<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. When looking down they fall off. I think this has something to do with the way they were designed. Since I don't look down to watch T.V. - this is not a big deal at all. They are actualy designed to wrap/conform to your head, so even though I don't mind it, they can take a nose dive into a bowl of cereal so heads up (no pun intended) there.<br /><br />2. If your tv is on pause, or mute, the headphones turn off and you hear static. Not a big deal- but if you have volume up, and walk a way a second to do something don't forget to leave them at your seat. The initial shock and awe of the static is irritating. Again, not  deal breaker.<br /><br />Other than that- if your a busy Dad and Husband who is looking to just unwind in the evening and don't want to wake up the kiddos watching your latest shows/movies look no further. You'll be satisfied."
R2JMAG814QRLT8,4,headphones are light and ear piece covers are soft.....<br />for the price they work very well..<br />the only thing that I wish it had would be a way to make it fit tighter<br />to my head..they tend to slide off when I bend over...but that<br />might make it uncomfortable..
R31DV3IBFXC5CW,5,I'm very satisfied with this item. I like the fact I can turn it off when not using it and not lose battery power. Also like the recharging system.
R10NZA4CK1M6QL,5,Pros:<br />Wireless<br />Recharges when headphone sits on cradle.  Just place headphones on metal cradle as shown and it recharges<br />Control volume on headphone<br />On/off switch is on headphone<br />Sound quality is well beyond what is needed for TV listening.  I even listened to &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34; Led Zeppelin movie and the sound was amazing.<br />Tuning dial on headphone; I was able to get perfect audio.<br />Sound is still fantastic walking to another room.  I could even listen to the basketball game from outside my house.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The ear pad does not surround the ear; but this is a very minor issue.<br /><br />I will be buying another pair for our bedroom TV!
R1WR5QQPSPSAUX,5,The headphone set made it easy to hear every sound coming from the TV clearly. It was easy to hook up and charges when not in use so it's always ready to use.
R1BWHNFC7JKMED,5,"We bought these headphones for my Dad to use while watching TV.  We had seen much more expensive headphones, but these are terrific.  Comfortable, easy to use, and the sound quality is top notch.  Would recommend these to anyone."
R2ZITJK1HRTK24,3,"I did my research on various wireless headsets and the RS120 Wireless RF Headphones appeared to be the best for my requirements. I purchased them as a gift for my 92-year-old aunt who lives in a nursing home. The other lady in her room complained about the loudness of her TV (my aunt is hard of hearing) so this would solve that problem. I tested the RS120 headset at home on my own television, and they worked perfectly.<br /><br />At the nursing home, I plugged in the RS120 to the electrical outlet and my aunt's TV, but couldn't get it working. There's a small switch on the front of the base unit to change the channels, so in troubleshooting the problem, the switch setting was changed. I was surprised at what happened next--I could listen in on cell phone calls from other patients' rooms, but couldn't hear the TV audio!<br /><br />I didn't know that Sennheiser happened to pick the same RF channels as cell phones. This headset doesn't appear to be designed to work in an environment where cellular phones are plentiful. Otherwise, it works great. As they say, &#34;Your mileage may vary.&#34;<br /><br />Now I've ordered an infrared headset which isn't affected by radio frequency signals."
R31SO650M42DU5,5,"I have been having trouble hearing voices on the TV and was amazed when I put these on.  It sounds as if I am in a theater and I love the fit, them being wireless and that they recharge on the cradle.  :)"
R1G903N28I695C,4,"When I first got these, they were turned in/rotated too far. I had to turn them myself (with a fear of breaking them).  They now fit well, or at least much better.<br /><br />When you pause the show you're watching (or turn off the TV), after a few minutes, loud static (like from a radio) will start coming through the speakers.  I guess this is to let you know that the headphones are still on and aren't being charged (as they don't turn themselves off when not being used.)<br /><br />The speakers are flat where it goes against your ear, unlike the doughnut design from yesteryear.  I found this odd at first, but now appreciate it, as it's more comfortable to wear glasses, as the pressure against your ear is now uniform, where before, it was pressing against the outer part of your ear, where your glasses sit.<br /><br />As far as performance goes, they work quite well.  Overall, I am glad I got these."
R1SP0R59CXBOGS,5,"These headphones exceeded my expectations for sound quality and ease of operation. There were headphone sets that I looked at  that cost far more that could not produce any finer sound. The price was excellent value for quality received and far exceeded my expectations. In fact, I was so impressed with these headphones that I ordered a second set for my mother-in-law to solve a TV hearing problem that she has. And she loves them. 'nuf said."
R27XUCXE1O3K21,5,Have been unable to understand speech from TV until I got my Sennheiser RS120.  Everything is clear as a bell now.  I can move around the house without loosing the signal and have no &#34;hiss&#34; as with most other devices.
R2NK7RIXBN2GPG,5,"Great sound ,works throughout the house . The clarity is amazing and the recharging a breeze. The only drawback are the instructions are not clear and we had to call the help line , which was easy and the problem was solved"
R3PSIUUGBWI4T1,5,"Included all possible connections needed, hooked up very simply out of the box and works great. I connected to both a Xbox and direct to my guitar amp and both use cases worked flawlessly. Highly recommend."
R11OXWG7O0D64J,5,These are great headphones but I did return them as they would not work with the sound bar that we have attached to our bedroom TV. Would work great with a regular TV.
RLVKTGTQHXFKR,4,"Bought these for my aging parents when they moved to a small apartment. One parent likes to watch TV, the other would rather read, so these headphones were key to maintaining marital harmony. My dad is a bit hard of hearing, but with these headphones he can turn the volume to a comfortable level to hear the ball game while putting the TV speakers on &#34;mute&#34; if my mother doesn't care to hear it. These are more expensive than &#34;tv ears&#34; up front, but worth it in the long run because there are no small pieces that can come off and get lost, they sit comfortably on the ear rather than in, they are of sturdier construction and they last longer.<br /><br />Pros: Good sound quality; charging stand can be on a table or hung on a wall; simple to use once they're set up<br />Cons: The instructions for setup are vague and I don't think my dad would have had the patience to figure them out had I simply handed him the unopened box. And for anyone with questions about the lights: the red light stays on when the headphones are properly placed on the stand and the green light is on only when the television (or whatever the stand is connected to) is on and transmitting a signal."
R1AU6JMLDD09K5,4,These headphones are long lasting and durable. You can put them on and walk away from your house and still hear what's playing. Very nice looking and comfortable. The sound quality is good. I would recommend these. It comes with a charger which makes it very convenient to not waste money on batteries.
R2629RJYCND4V7,2,"Too bad.  Otherwise I would have kept them.  They were purchased for my wife who has been using TV Ears for a couple of years.  She put these on with the TV, turned up to max volume, and took them off all within five minutes."
R1OJKU5EL1YHWZ,5,These headphones are amazing. They easily paired with my iPod and charge quickly. When I putting my devise in my back pocket I don't have to fuss with the wires. I recommend this product.
R13PCKTUTJJOJL,5,"My mother is hard of hearing, so this is perfect for her. However, after a couple years the headphones stopped working correctly. We wanted to buy replacement headphones, but they were so expensive, we decided to just buy a whole replacement set-up...in case the cradle/charger decided to break also. So now we have 2 cradle/chargers, but one working headphone. She does love it...even though every time she takes it from her head it somehow pinches her hair and rips one or 2 out!"
R3G5US1PJMQUWO,4,"What an incredible deal we got these on. Very good sounding headphones that won't disappoint! Highly recommended, especially for bedroom use at night."
R2JNQ7JW6E331E,4,I purchased these headphones to replace a pair of Sony headphones that were difficult to listen too because of hissing sound at low volumes.  These are fantastic!  I can listen to the tv and adjust the volume with the receiver.  The volume of the receiver doesn't have to be adjusted when these are unplugged.  I can move around my house and still listen to the tv.  Important when doing activities during commercials of a live event.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones to watch tv.  Not the best quality for music but much better than average.
R13NJVGQ2ATQAY,5,"I have no idea how long-lasting this item will be, but at the two to three week period, I couldn't be happier.  Close to half a century of gunfire has left my ears with little hearing other than extreme tinnitus.  My poor wife has ears like sonar sensors and like the TV volume set to &#34;8&#34;.  I cannot hear it below &#34;35&#34;, so she has to wear earplugs.  No longer!  I now watch TV with the volume turned off and just use the control on the Sennheiser's.  Once more a happy family..."
R17U4IF8KQ35XO,4,"With a light sleeping five-month-old these were a must have! I bought two pairs for my wife and I so we could watch a movie here and there while the baby nursed. Sound was great, no interference, and super easy to setup. Best of all we can run two pairs off one base. I have always used Sennheiser for my video mics and ear buds because of their consistent quality and they did not disappoint with these units.<br /><br />The only reason they're not five star rated is it doesn't take long to auto shut off leaving you with an ear full of static if you don't pay attention."
R2T80WTFLYRXS5,4,"My family sleeps in late, but not me so I needed something to be able to listen to the tv while I am waiting for them to get up. These fit the need."
R3OZY1SSLPR7A7,4,"I utilize these headphones on my job, within part of my job and they have been very useful and helpful."
R3OOELGAIEWP94,5,"I've been using this product for the past five (5) years and am totally sold on it (my original purchase was from a local retail store in Honolulu).  I've tried other wireless headphones but none come close to comfort, durability, and longevity as this one.  I bought thru Amazon cuz the price was great.  As usual, delivery was as promised and item arrived in good condition.  I always recommend this product and now will recommend getting it thru Amazon.  note:  for those of you who order more than a few times, get the &#34;Prime&#34;, it is truly worth it!"
RHEGRDCK8PGDW,3,I have two of these because two of us are hard of hearing.  Sound is pretty good. The biggest complaint I have is that the headphones seem to drift and need to be tuned in periodically. They are hard to tune. A slight turn of the tuning dial changes the frequency abruptly.<br /><br />They fit on my head loosely. If I look down they may fall off.
R1LG3CACNOEB8B,5,"I have lived in apartments with my husband for almost 12 years and I cannot tell you how many annoyed hours I have spent listening to his crazy TV shows and movies. He is not a huge fan of mine, either. I finally bought these and hooked them up to the TV and our marriage has never been better.<br /><br />I did buy some cheaper wireless headphones at one point from another company (not Amazon or Sennheiser) and these are so much better quality. I think wireless headphones are the type of thing where you really want to have a good quality item. The cheap ones had tons of static and never really worked well. These are great. I did follow the advice of another Amazon reviewer who suggested turning the TV volume way up and the volume on the headphones down a bit.<br /><br />The one caution I would share is- if you have the headphones powered on, but the TV is off, or paused, and no sound is coming out of it for a couple of minutes, the headphones lose their signal and start playing super loud static. So if you need to pause your DVR to take a short break, don't absentmindedly walk around with the headphones on or you will get a rude awakening. Just turn the headphones off as well, and make sure you wash your hands before touching them again. ;)"
R2LL9TRNUR6CWX,5,The highs and lows sound pretty good with no static when adjusting volume. Once in a while it will disconnect and then static rings your ears. Not sure why yet. Range is great! I've gone as far as 60 feet from base without losing connection.
RZEPFMT5108CG,5,"If ever a product has been so mistakenly  scorned, I have yet to see it. These have very nice clear and crisp sound for music and for tv/movies.<br /> Now If someone gets a lemon, or they don't work properly, I would understand their frustration.<br />But 90% of the negative reviews are the reviewers own lack of understanding. Pops, hisses, crackles, background noise?<br />I have none. That's right. None. I did though when I first hooked them up. But because I understand the base is an antenna, I moved it until the noise stopped. Took me about 8 seconds. Ok, the base unit. It's an antenna. Antenna's need to be positioned correctly for reception. Ever rolled up to a traffic light in your car and the radio cuts out a little? What do you do? Roll forward an inch. Same premise here.<br /> So what can I say. I have NO hiss. I have NO pops. I have NO crackles. If I don't, why cant the people writing bad reviews? Any questions please feel free to ask. I'll help all who need."
R3ESA8P630BPJ5,5,Worked out great. Husband can hear tv and the tv doesn't have to be so loud. The tv can be muted so I don't have to listen to what he is watching while I read.
R1545OW9BVZZ35,5,"I have purchased, and reviewed many items purchased through Amazon.com, and I guess I must be cheap, because 90% of them I feel are over priced. I have another pair of wireless headphones, I purchased at, of all places, TJMax, for only $15. that work just as well. These work well, as other reviewers have written, there is a slight noise in the background that goes way when you turn up the volume, but then sometimes it's too loud. I feel the noise can be ignores, when you are just so thankful, you can hear the TV, and the people on TV don't sound like they are speaking a language you don't understand.<br />The fact that I had $30. In points, that I used toward the price of these, makes them even better."
R233P5V1T7WZ6C,1,"Was not able to get the headphones working.  I am a technology person, too.  The instructions were not great.  Sorry ..."
R2YSD3W43QFB5G,5,This product really helps when multiple people are in the home doing different tasks and one person wants to be watching TV or listening to music. There is excellent sound quality and range for a reasonable price.
R2JBGGH5QP0N83,3,"There is no way to adjust the headset, and it is very uncomfortable.  The sound is great, if you can stand wearing something that tight on your head.  I bought this so I could listen to TV in bed while my husband sleeps, but I found them so uncomfortable they have become a dust collector!"
RDRHEXJ329IA6,5,"I wanted a headset with good range and audio quality. I listen to mostly audiobooks, podcasts, online video. These worked great. I can walk all around the house and yard. Quality drops of in places and I hear noise but still good enough. I used a pair of digital set from Rocketfish. The audio would drop out or stutter completely in the same environment. Also had interference issues with routers, phones, etc operating on same frequencies as digital headsets. Sound quality is very even across spectrum. I am not a big fan of heavy bass. I have Tinnitus. These work perfect for watching TV."
R1RS207D35FJMY,5,The shipment was prompt and the product was undamaged.  My purpose for purchasing these was to properly affix them to my TV so I had no problems hearing what was said on the programs. I couldn't get them to work~!  I'm highly disappointed!  For FM/AM they're fine.
R3R1SGWOIW3SKM,5,i personally love that this headphones uses only two rechargeable batteries instead of my last headphones which needed four regular batteries but i noticed that the rechargeable batteries die out after a few uses where i had to buy more rechargeable batteries but it doesn't matter the range and sound it good when batteries have full juice. One huge downside is that if left on and it doesn't hear sound for a while it will create a ear splinting static. Other then that it's a good pair of headphones for people new to wireless headphones.
R3770AVCK3ESCX,5,"I bought these Sennheiser wireless headphones to listen to my new flat screen tv.  I am hard of hearing, and in the past I've had to raise the volume or use closed captioning, both of which annoy anyone with normal hearing.  These headphones do very, very well; only occasionally does someone on tv speak so unclearly that I can't understand even with headphones.  The sound quality of the tv is vastly improved with these headphones.  If I choose to listen to one of the available music channels, the sound comes rhrouh rich and full, rather than the slihtly tinny sound from the tv's speakers,  When these headphones are tuned properly, not a difficult task, I hear none of the hiss described by others.  All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase."
R3TZAFQREPFCM5,4,"Sound very good, especially for the mid-range price point.  Comfortable and easy to tune, only drawback is they don't cup around your ears like some others."
R1BQDPRP2X5ETT,5,"I love it, and thrilled with it. All those wasted years with that TV ears poked in my ears.  This one is awesome! Now I can HEAR things I missed before.  The sound is so sharp. Thank you,thank you Sennheiser!"
R3R1MLJJPIQ5M0,5,"Bought this for my parents and they love it.  Between the grandkids and the parents these headphones get used almost every day and they work well, are easy to use and sound great.  As for ease of use my five year old, seven year old and two parents who are technically challenged when it comes to stuff like this can all use it with a minimum of fuss."
R2RMZ65S8HXQNJ,5,An incredible sound coupled with re-chargind capabilities.  Plus the reception covers a very large distance.  I'll recommend these to anyone in the market for television headphones.
ROPGPJ3AK5A4Q,5,Had them before. God quality a much cheaper than they were 10 years ago. I Would recommend to almost anyone
R2R0QQG7V5USWU,1,We have been unable to get this to work. Should give 0 stars but couldn't. Would not recommend this product.
RLJHFKG447TP1,5,Easy to set up.  The sound is clear enough that I can even hear whispers in movies and if I need to leave the room I can continue to hear anywhere in the house.
R2R81BYWU7XS7W,4,I have used the RS120 wireless headphones for a month. It has a nice clear sound and I can hear the TV a lot better now. Once you get  the tuner  adjusted to the right place it works great. There has been a few  times that I hit the switch and knock it out of tune.Its nice that you can walk around the house and still hear the TV. I have walked inside to the back bedroom of my house which is about 75 feet and two walls away and still hear the TV. Like other reviews  stated that if you move your head too much they will fall off.
R3DVURBI5ZVAOG,5,These are the second set I bought for the TV in the master bedroom. The first were the TV in the living room. They are great and better than expected. The first set I've had for about 3-4 years and use them daily. Highly recommend.
RVIW74497XGML,5,Easy to install and workes great with my hearing aids too It has really been a help to my tv watching and my music listening as well
R1WW4T0WPEAY95,5,"This is my 2nd set, I have one for myself and I got my 80+ mother a set and we are both very happy with them, they are comfortable on the ears and the sound is great."
R228734L3XMJZ9,5,This product has surpassed my expectations!  My husband loves the theatre-type sound and I enjoy not having to listen to his choice of TV programs.  We would recommend this to anyone who wants peace and quiet OR to one who goes to another part of the house with the headphones on and still be able to listen to his program.  They prove comfortable even after a whole evening of wear!
RIX9C1YZTTJ03,5,It sounds like I can actually hear the tv again with good bass and music where my hearing aids are so crappy with this type of audio.  Buy yourself a set and your parents.  They will love you for it.
RMARKWVYGXGQH,4,Really works well and I like the sound.<br />Only thing I dislike is that it is heavy and is very warm on the ears. The old hanging style with the ear buds was a lot more comfortable.
R12F5U9433HS5C,5,"Very good product - no complaints at all - the audio quality, the clarity is amazing.  I recommend this product to anyone."
R3UY9LUT245P7V,5,"My friend moved into her daughter's house for a few months. What a zoo that place is. My friend goes to her room, turns one the tv, voila! Pease and quiet. From house noise anyway. She said she would recommend these headphones."
RV8KLY88517Y7,5,"Convenient, easy to set up, good range and sound.<br />I like the design in general.  It seems well thought out."
R2R72LSOF0B9EA,1,They almost worked for 2days. Theyvare not able to maintain a connnection with the transmitter. That is one issue. They also do not fit very well. I just replacd them with a cheap no name set for $20 that work great. I would not recommended this product.
R1XGNOW7S9D58H,5,We have two pairs of these. We use them all the time. They are great. Sound quality is great. Great purchase. Worth every penny
R1O6EJR6IDXAQU,2,TheSennheiser RS 120 on-ear-926mhz has an echo in it in relation to the sound bar. The sound comes on about a half a second before the person is talking and before you here it in the sound bar.<br /><br />:The echoing is loud and you have to turn up the sound on your headphones in order to not here it.<br /><br />I contacted the support office by phone and they told me they could not do anything about it. They said there would always be an echoing. Than I sent an e-mail to the support group and they have not answered me as yet.
R3JHBVDB7TEWNS,5,"Works as advertised, the sound is excellent and the range is extremely good, just what I expected when I ordered it"
RWG6RA70P3KQ1,4,"Have had no problem with hearing with this product and I like the fact that you could replace the rechargeable batteries that another popular headphone you can't.  Have the stand behind the TV and have had no static problems at all.  Really helps to hear clearer and not be blasted out while trying to understand what was said.  Only negative, and it is small, is that the headphones slip off easy if you tilt down to pickup something.  But another design that doesn't cause that has different comfort problems.  Believe this is an excellent buy with good quality."
R34CVVP8HQGP4V,5,I should have bought this sooner.I can now hear whats being said in my TV programs. I'm hard of hearing but can't afford a hearing aid. Until such time that I can this works for me to hear my TV shows. I never knew what i was missing.I don't have to blast the sound on the TV now. This works great !
R1BMIZV2XBHER7,5,"I have used this headset for years, 6-8 I think, and it started to fail. This purchase was a replacement. These are by far the best of the three brands that I have tried. They even work with y hearing aids, no feedback. The Merchant performed flawlessly; the package arrived on time and in perfect condition."
RRXSNKG6G8R5O,5,I like it especially when I watch the movie and listen the music. Use it quite often. It's a good product.
R2MOW5LEEIV5B3,4,Though the headphone is great and you learn to live with the static noise.. the adjustment become very painstaking at times.
R2R5PULX6KPZ3C,1,Did not work properly or consistently. Difficult to charge. While using it would create a &#34;blast&#34; of noise or static that hurt the ears. All and all a very unsatisfactory product.
R2TX856GXBQDKV,3,"I found the headphones too large & they were adjusted as small as possible. I have an average sized head, but they were very loose. I liked them otherwise. Disappointing. I returned them , but would liked to have found out if smaller headphones were available"
RC6IBQCSYPQ6M,4,"The quality of construction is very good.  The clarity of sound is great.  My only complaint is the tuning is very delicate.  All in all, it is a great product."
R1WDVJEKR370B8,5,"I am a big fan of Sennheiser headphones. I've had three pairs over fifteen to twenty years (each pair bought to replace an older, worn out pair). I bought the RS 120 to replace my RS 130 (after a mistaken detour to the RS 170). The sound is good, and so is the distance over which the headphones continue to pick up a signal from the base.<br />My buying advice for wireless headphones for TV watching. Get a set of headphones that<br />1) take standard batteries (AA, AAA, etc.)<br />2) has a user-replaceable battery<br />3) works even if you are not in “line of sight” of the transmitter<br />4) has a transmitter that is either always on, or can be turned on by turning on the headphones<br />5) is instant-on<br />Senneheiser’s RS 120 has all of these features. I like the HDR 130 headphones better than the new HDR 120. I’m using my old HDR 130’s with the new TR 120 base, and the HDR 120’s sit unused.<br />More advice: buy two sets of rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. I don’t use the charger on the base. When the batteries go dead, put them in the charger and replace with a set of freshly charged batteries. This way, the headphones are always sitting on the table where you watch TV and you can pick them up at any time without having to get up and take them off of the base. The batteries go dead maybe once a month, so it is much less hassle than having to get up and get them from the base every time you want to use the headphones."
RLQ59WHYH3VH0,4,"Exactly what I expected. Could have spent more for options that I didn't need,  but a good value for the dollar.<br />Not noise-cancelling, but that's good when you still need to hear what's going around you."
R2MTWGCKHQIAW5,2,The headphones don't work with much except maybe a tv.  I tried connecting to things like a laptop but  it won't connect.
R19RDVXN6JTE21,5,"I purchased this for my husband's use.  Somewhat hard of hearing, he was blasting the rest of the family out of the house when he watched telelvision.  These have worked very well for all of us.  He said the fit is very comfortable.  He is able to walk around the house, and out into the yard, without losing the signal.  There have been no issues with re-charging, either.  This was a replacement for a similar set that he has just worn out, and he remarked that the sound was much crisper, and clearer with this set than his earlier one."
R28UOW19M2WDUP,5,It works so good. Is exactly what I wanted and is very comfortable to wear. I just love the sound!
R1NITHP0Y4TDNC,4,Once you get it turned in(not always easy) these phone work well and have good distance.  I can even listen outside around my house.  They adjust well and are comfortable over long periods.  Do what I wanted
R3UIMT7G58L2OK,5,"I purchased these for my husband so he can watch TV while I'm sleeping and the sound won't bother me. Once we figured out how to hook these up, he absolutely loves them. They are well made and they are comfortable on his head as he's laying in bed watching.<br /><br />A helpful hint: The instructions aren't wildly clear about how to hook these up. They say to plug it into the &#34;audio source&#34; and we assumed that meant into the Audio outputs on the TV. Nope. My husband looked up a YouTube tutorial on them and he figured out we had to plug these into the Audio outputs on our DirecTV box.<br /><br />Also, depending on proximity to your neighbors, you may be able to pick up phone conversations, which is disturbing."
R1NA3L5SW46TJC,5,"My headphones are better than I expected.  I'm a little hard of hearing and had trouble understanding dialogue on television programs.  I can now understand what is being said without the television volume being too loud for others.<br /><br />Also, I stay up later than my wife and can now reduce the audio on the TV to zero, while listening on my headphones at any volume t I select.  she gets a better nights sleep and I can understand what they're saying on my programs.  A win-win.<br /><br />The headphones are perfect, audio is clear and understandable, and the audible range moving anywhere around the house is fine."
R1X6YWJNH16KI3,5,Great for couples in bed if one wants it to be quiet so they can read and/or sleep while the one with the headphones on gets to enjoy their show.
R3KLLKYPL1HVF3,5,Works well when others are in the room talking and the TV gets turned down. Now I can hear everything on the TV well.
R27XE57MSX4Q36,5,"I read dozens of reviews before purchasing these headphones. I was worried about the earphones falling off my head and not receiving sound well enough, etc. But the positive reviews also convinced me to try them out. I didn't find a single thing wrong with this product. In fact everything so far has been right. It was easy to set up the unit and get the headphones charged. Once I was ready to use them, the instructions led me through each step and I found a good location on the tuning dial to hear my selection. I should say that I use the headphones primarily to listen/watch baseball games without annoying others, so I have no recommendations with regard to using the headphones for more lofty purposes, such as listening to opera or symphony music. However the product itself is in good condition, seems well made and certainly worth a try. As part of a test of this headphone set, I walked around my house, went into a bathroom and closed the door, went outside, went into the detached office and never lost connection. That seems to be a wider range than they promise, which means I can sit outside in the summer time and listen or watch baseball games on a lounge chair. As for complaints from some on thise site that the headphones kept falling off the user's head, they felt a little strange to me, too, when I first put them on. I looked in a mirror and found out that they were not on correctly. They were crooked. Once straightened out, they became among the most comfortable headsets I've used. They are very easy to adjust. I would recommend that if you are considering good wireless headphones, you choose this one. Great price, too."
R1U5BKRDI1DHNG,4,"I purchased these wireless head phones because my surround sound system was disturbing my neighbors.  The sound quality is great and battery life is outstanding (I've yet to exhaust them, even after falling asleep with them on).  Even better I can use them in any room in the house without interference.  They are a bit bulky and uncomfortable as are all headphones of this style."
RUGYQK53BWWC6,4,I ordered these headphones.  They have good range and good sound.  If you pay attention to the lights on the front they have a good wireless recharging capability.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is that they avoid enclosing the ear so if there are things going on in the background you won't be able to shut that out.
R24MOHE8SGWUAI,5,The whole setup is great once you figure out where the analog dial needs to be for perfect reception.  Sennheiser is trustworthy as always.
RGB9L8J1KZTVI,5,"Best wireless I have used. I have gone through 2 Sony's and 1 JVC and this is by far the best. Clear sound no buzzing, warbling, like others."
R1TJB84WPCP4P,4,"WHY?<br />I purchased these to replace the $15 dollar pair of wireless headphones I purchased from Sharper Image as they were not too great to begin with, but recently I could not get rid of the enormous amount of static coming through them, so it was time for an upgrade.<br /><br />SOUND?<br />I have had them for three nights now and have used them for hours on end. The sound is very good. Don't get me wrong, these aren't $250 headphones. The bass identity is decent and the sound is precise and clear with good mid. They came with a charge on the batteries (lasted about 2 hours). I plugged the RCA connections into my TV, turned on the headphones and adjusted the Tune setting on the earpiece slightly for better signal, but reception was strong and immediate. Some other products require &#34;syncing&#34; on different channels, but this one picks up the signal quickly without much frustration. I found only one spot in my kitchen (about 30 feet away) where I picked up some interference, but it was very slight and possibly due to my entire family's phones gathered on the counter top close by. I walked out to my mailbox (70 ft) and around the outside of the house with zero problems. The sound was just as clear as it was sitting on my couch right in front of the TV. I have yet to hear the first bit of static or background noise. I also read another user say it actually made the TV experience better by allowing you to hear all of the background noise in whatever you are watching (people talking, ambient sounds). This was absolutely true and it made me smile knowing I got all of the information I could have out of the Game of Thrones premiere I had recorded. The only qualm I have with these is that they really do not reduce any noise from the headphones from entering the world around you. So, if you want to lay in bed next to your significant other while watching Die Hard as loud as possible, he/she will not be asleep for long, as it will be almost as clear as just turning up the TV volume.<br /><br />FIT?<br />I read a lot of people complaining about the fit of this unit. Holding it in your hand, the ear pieces are almost touching, so when you put it on, the fit to your head is tight, but not tight enough to be uncomfortable. I found these very comfortable to wear while marathon-ing True Detective. Having said that, If you jerk your head forward, they will slide without question (I have a larger head, so i can imagine it would get worse on smaller users). However, to negate this you simply don't headbang or do flips while wearing it. It takes a little effort to make them come off. The fact that they don't budge while walking leads me to think they would perform well in this area for those who want to walk on a treadmill with them. I'm not sure how much more I would risk unless I knew I would be able to catch them if they fell off. The ear &#34;cups&#34; (I use &#34;&#34; because these are not actually cups, but flat on the ear) do swivel back and forth, so they always lay flat against your ear.<br /><br />QUALITY?<br />This pair is made well enough to withstand normal use and probably a few easy falls. They are very light, giving off the impression of cheap build quality. Eh ... maybe so, but I wouldn't want them any heavier, so I won't complain. The controls are tight, but easy to use. Everything ON the device feels solid and like it will end up lasting quite some time. The charging base of the unit is very light as well and that puts off a cheap feel to me.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this set to anyone who wants a great sounding set for the TV or to listen to music at moderate volumes around other people, or at high volumes while along, as they still sound good when you crank them! And for someone who wants a seemingly well built set for a price under $100 (not much :)).<br /><br />Pros: Price, Sound, Ease of setup and use, Clarity, Rechargeable!!!!<br /><br />Cons: Possibly the fit (not for me), MAYBE the quality. Iam iffy on that one to be honest."
R3FNB7N1TRCT83,5,It was easy to use and no setup. It is great for when your family is either studying or reading
RR6SL3YQX7FN,5,"I'm hearing impaired and hated having to raise the volume on my tv. Thanks to my Sennheiser, I can hear clearly without bothering anyone. I got an additional headphone for my hubby (who stays up late watching tv). This way, he can enjoy his programs without waking me up!. I can go about my chores while listening to music or news because it has an excellent range. I've even gone outside my house and can still pick up the sound. By the way, I can use my hearing aids while using the headphone and it's not uncomfortable but I usually don't use them because the volume control can be raised significantly. I really recommend these headphone for anyone who has difficulty hearing or doesn't want to bother others. I've had these headphones for a couple of months and now, with the really hot weather approaching (I live in the tropics), I want to see if I don't get too hot wearing them."
R2BDHVZN25H55E,4,I've purchased numerous Sennheiser headphones over the years and the sound quality is wonderful. These also have recharging batteries (when you put it back on the cradle) which saves a lot of money in batteries. And I can walk around my entire apartment and still hear everything. The only issue I have with these is they are really loose. They fall off if you happen to look down.
R3E8HMQYS4OGIH,1,"Lots of static the first time I used it but after the 2nd day, the static was too much!  I had to go on travel for a month and when I came back, found out I was 3 days over the return deadline :(  Upset that I can't get my money back!  Do not waste your time or money on this!"
RZ44AO76OZA39,5,"Sound quality is excellent. Connectivity amazing. Range is of the charts and the product quality it self is very very high. If you never had a Sennheier headphone before, don't be affraid. They are amazing."
R1B77U28TS9Q7O,5,This is my second set. (first set were dropped on slate floor) I've used this model for the past 6 years. Sound quality is very good and I'll never watch TV/movie without them. I never realized how much I was missing before I received these as a gift so many years ago.
R2GBD4F29URR3S,2,"I chose this rating because I have to be honest and look out for others in deciding what's good and not good.<br /><br />This set of headphones does not achieve volume desired and one has to be in certain positions for them not to have constant static. Once center tuned to the signal, they are okay, but do not have a good sound whatsoever...basic mono/mono with no stereo sound produced.<br /><br />I would definitely look into a couple of good name brand units over this product.<br /><br />I would not ever choose these again, nor can I give a good review. People deserve to 'hear' what they pay for."
RDP5F8GWN8V9R,4,"I love them, we bought them because my husband likes to let everyone know what he is watching on TV? Taking classes online and needing some quiet time but yet together with your love one.... these are perfect."
RZBZXPYP7N918,4,Great to be able to hear what people are saying on the tv...but they yend to be loose on my head and dont fit well
RH6L3AM1V9HR9,2,"It was not easy to keep the headset tuned into my TV; if you touched the wrong button, you'd get some radio station or something.  Had to turn off and reboot too many times."
R1FJ5KZ1ALNRQE,5,"Easy to use, good reception, worth the money.  I replaced a cheaper model that did not last.  I am much happier with this product."
R1OY4CC3KNS9Z7,4,"I finally am able to hear the dialog on shows that I was missing, especially the female voices. Also getting a lot of sounds I never heard before. They are not as comfortable as I thaught."
R2EKEKIZ0CT4MT,3,"Out of the box I had issues with the headphones. The right ear would be on full with the slightest increase of volume, but the left ear was dead. I did some internet searching and came across someone with the same issue and was able to clear it up with some electronics cleaner being sprayed on the potentiometer for the volume. Issue disappeared for a few days and then it happened again. After the second shot of cleaner the issue has not returned.<br /><br />I do like the quality of sound from the headphones, but you cannot wear these unless you're sitting still. If I drop something on the floor I need to put a hand on the headphones at the same time as reaching down. Otherwise the headphones will slip and fall to the floor.<br /><br />I dislike how the transmitter will turn itself off if it the volume is too low (can't listen to any relaxing (quiet) music). I have been woken up a lot of times because the transmitter turned off and the headphones were outputting static at full. It would be nice if there was a way to keep the transmitter always on. It doesn't matter if I turn the volume at the source up all the way if my music is quiet."
RZPWN3OHLMVZ7,5,Sitting in a hot tub - listening to music or watching our favorite TV show or Movie is quite relaxing.  These headphones are the best!
R2310CHNMLLYR2,5,I needed to hear my TV voices more clearly.  The RS120 gives me this pleasure.  It is light weight and comfortable.  Charging is no problem.  I have attached the charging/transmitter unite to the wall near the TV.  I then hang the headphones onto the charger (as seen on picture).  The RS120 has worked just as advertised.
R1FQFGFCKURWTO,5,"VERY happy.  I have a rowing machine, and it is NOISY.  THESE wireless headphones WORK, and I can row, watch, and listen to whatever I feel like without waking the dead.  Well worth the money."
RO1JW881OTD6Z,5,Purchased after becoming unhappy with TV Ears.  These offer excellent sound reproduction without becoming uncomfortable over the ear.  I like them enough to have purchased two other sets for use in our vacation homes.
R3DPNJSOQ4SS76,5,Very easy to connect to the TV and very pleased with its clarity.  Wife very relieved that I no longer keep asking her &#34; What was said or why is this happening?'  Easy to charge & recommend it to anyone in need of hearing assistance.
R29UZEPXLFI0TP,5,Recently purchased the headphones and am very happy. Previously had Sony wireless headphones that I connected through cable box that worked well however the range was limited and you had to be directly in front of the unit or you lost the signal. After we got rid of our cable box I couldn't get them to work through the regular t.v. which lead me to these Sennheiser headphones. These headphones worked exactly as described and I can literally walk out of the room into my kitchen and hear the t.v. with no loss of signal. Very happy.
R32362M7JJV033,5,"These headphone were a lot more then I expected for the price ,they work great and use them while watching TV and movies and should have bought them long ago. Good Deal"
R19XSXVZGQONXN,5,I read up on this brand before making the purchase.  I am soooo pleased with the quality of sound.  I can pick up sound from the transmitter when I am several rooms away and it is still clear.  The earphones are comfortable and stay charged quite a long time.
R2YW29SLNG5H,5,"These headphones perform as advertised, were easy to install, no extra plugs needed, and I can walk around the house wearing them and doing chores without missing anything.  Makes vacuuming a delight!  I did experience a little interference, but it was negligible.  My husband, who has diminished hearing, loves them, too.  He wears them when he takes the dogs out in the back yard (big yard).  Took some things to the neighbor next door and said he never missed a word.  Need to buy another unit.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who suffers from hearing loss or who just wants to move about in their house or on their property and not miss their shows."
RW4GI3FM1YP36,4,"Not sure why I hadn't looked into these before. I'm a veteran, with a high-frequency hearing loss, and not being able to hear all the dialog on TV shows, finally got to the point where I wanted to do something about it. I don't have a problem with DVD's, or Blu-Ray, as I can put on sub-titles. Anyway, these headphones have been a boon to me. I had been using earbuds, plugged into a curly cord, plugged into my stereo receiver, but dealing with the cord got to be annoying. Now that I've gotten used to the wireless, instead of just wearing them for my favorite shows, I use them all the time. Part of getting used to them, meant dealing with the weight, as these obviously are heavier than ear buds, and making sure that they're placed on the cradle properly, so that they will always be charged when you use them."
RFVAWVW3HILJ,5,Very comfortable and crystal clear transmission.  Indeed I was using it with the RS130 transmitter and am happy they it works with that transmitter.
R23Z29XPVG5FRS,5,"Good quality, great sound and range.  Tendency to slip off you head when you look down but wear the ear pieces lower.  Still very, very, pleased, highly recommend."
R2HU8DXFUIXMM0,5,"Just received my wireless headphones and they work very well. When I first turned them on, there was a lot of hiss (noise) because the volume on the amp was set too low. Any radio system has noise. To get the highest signal to noise ratio (the best sound) be sure that the volume on the source is high enough that you don't hear the hiss but not so high that you get distortion (clipping). My headphones work perfectly over a wide range of amplifier volume setting ranging from -30 to 0 decibels.<br /><br />I am using the headphone jack for my source. If you are plugging into the &#34;monitor&#34; output on your source instead, the volume control may have no effect. In this case, however, the signal should be strong enough that you hear no hiss."
RTI5EBQOJ9XQV,5,"The head phones works fine but the ear pieces are some type foam that after a few minutes starts to irritate.  I would love if the head set would have a spring closure instead of the one size fits all.  Very uncomfortable.  My wife loves them since she can no longer hear what I need to hear but the headphones themselves are simply a vice on my head.  I wear a 7 3/4&#34; hat.  so!!!!!!????  This is my review<br /><br />The addendum is after a 3 month vacation in my motor home without the Sennheiser RS 120 headphone.  Well, this really made a believer of me.  I had the volume on full but could not really hear the dialog in movies.  Return home this week and was able to use my headphones and wola, I can hear again.  My previous remark about the &#34;uncomfortable&#34; and the foam around the ear pieces irritating, being able to hear with clarity is well worth the minute negative comments.  If you have a hearing difficulty, this is the help you need.  Just be careful that you do not turn the volume to loud or you will damage what remaining hearing you have left.  Now, YES, I would recommend this product to those of us that deny a hearing loss due to our wives saying so, but because this helps the kinda deaf to hear our TV&#34;S"
R1T8HQ60BNRA7V,4,Ok sound. Decent reception at about 15 feet. Nice ergo style that looks ok<br />next to the flat screen. Only downside is that my ears get hot after about 30 minutes of use.
R38FXFW7PYMXE4,1,"I don't know about you, but when I hear Sennheiser, I am expecting this to be a superior product. Or at least slightly better than fifteen dollar RCA wireless headphones I purchased 12 years ago. They are not in any way acceptable. These are subject to an enormous amount of static and interference. i am using them in a area with conditioned power but still they pick up static when I turn my head 5-10 feet away from the transmitter. Also, got the amazon warehouse deal and they looked like they found them in the gutter - would it have killed amazon to wipe these off before they sent them to me..."
R3PM9PY71YHJJV,4,"This is everything claimed of it.  Perhaps the sound would be better for double the price or more, but the value inherent in these headphones is very high for my standards.  I do like to hear a good bass, but not to the point of sounding artificial.  There was some interference from the TV at first but I switched the channel on the base and the headset and that remedied that issue.  I use it for CD listening, primarily and expect to use it for a long time.  I would have liked to have purchased a spare set of replacement ear covers, but the price online was much higher than direct from Sennheiser.  I didn't want to get on any more lists though nor paying shipping, so I will see how long the original ones last/"
R2FFH4JI4MTW8D,5,"Incredible sound quality, like sitting in a movie theatre. Comfortable headsets that you can wear for endless hours. Excellent product. Wireless. Gives you freedom to move around the house and listen at the same time. I would never go without wearing them. No worrying about disturbing neighbors. No subtitles needed because every word and sound can be heard with this headset.One of the best electronic products available. I highly recommend this headset."
RAKLW7PE09GLC,2,"I was replacing another Seenheiser ,same model, that had quit sending sound to the left ear.  The adjustment was critical to hit at the exact mark and I have found the same problem with the one ordered above.  It must be an inherent problem with this brand as the problems are identical.<br /><br />I used Discover rewards to purchase it and those I can't recover but It would be more expensive to try to repair these.  Haven't decided what to do but will definitely not order another Seenheiser product.<br /><br />The price was actually 99.95 with free shipping. The reduced price to $87 was posted just after I ordered at the 99.95 price and Amazon would not qualify me for the reduced price."
R1X5SG38GBHS74,5,Love them.  They work great.<br /><br />Great sound quality<br /><br />No problem with signal strength.<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear.  I love these headphones!
R3K1RIE4MAQZT7,5,"My husband used to have the TV volume up so loud that I could watch the same program in another room w/out any sound.  Now, he can crank it up and I don't have to go deaf in the process.  This product has truly been a God-send."
RBB09GQXUJ9G7,5,"Excellent product, worked perfectly since the beginning.  Sound is crisp and clear and has good reception range, even across walls.  Really love it."
RMFMQ2MBZEGNA,5,"Have had these about a year,I can walk any were around my 1800sq.ft house & on the back deck & they never fade."
R1PV6U58JR3YS,2,"The unit works okay with my tablet, but I couldn't get it to work with an analogue to digital audio converter box. Also, the headphones were simply uncomfortable. Too rigid and tight."
R1DZQAXHJ7LFYK,5,This is an excellent product that works beautifully as designed.  This wireless headphone has very good range and excellent sound clarity.
R109UKUGEWCF0H,4,"It works just fine, just not as good as Phillips, I also feel they are a little large that's why I bought the Phillips."
R36R2ZBNUNE99S,3,"They work pretty good, but there is a little more hissing than I expected when you get a little outside the room edges.  Also, they were used and slightly stretched out (now a little big on my head)."
R2KPZAM4UAE6YC,1,"Delivery was very prompt, but the unit would not power up when plugged in.  So no idea if or how they work."
R1ZKEHS3TCKFY,4,"These headphones are being used in a church sanctuary for hearing impaired congregants. I gave them 4 stars due to ease of use. However, they are very hard to tune to get quality sound without hiss and crackle but serve the purpose for which they were purchased. I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality and ease of recharge."
RMFQ7XBRG9D9B,4,"Very unhappy with this item. It worked once, now won't come on. Have contacted Stennheiser tech support - waiting for a reply.<br /><br />I was wrong. You have to turn the volume up on your receiver way beyond normal listening levels to make the base unit power up and connect to the headphones. Then they work fine."
R2HOE0IY2UBTN0,3,I'm not an audiophile but the sound seems very good. My only complaint is I wish they fit better. They are not as snug as I would like. I have a normal size head. It seems they are designed for individuals with larger heads.
R1J95TWJO4SRE4,2,I still get static when I'm only sitting a foot away from the charging station. The slight static noise gets annoying. You can also hear the headphones when they're not on you.
R330HNDV2TK5PT,5,"I am hearing impaired and have been using these for a few months now to watch tv and play video games.  They work very well.  Usually when I watch tv I need to have the sub titles on.  Without subtitles and using my hearing aides and the volume turned up, I still miss quite a bit of the dialogue.  However, with these I can remove my hearing aids, keep the tv at a normal volume and still hear perfectly.  I obviously can't say you will have the same results, but if you have hearing loss, these would certainly be worth a shot."
R1F0RKJOLJIUT2,5,"Brother got one and loved it so we bought one from Amazon, too.  Simple to hook up and works like a charm."
R300QLMNT5TKVZ,2,"no chord!  I got them used,  I dont know if new ones are better or not  I have a rubber band around the ear band to keep the phones a little tighter!  All in All worth the 42 bucks but I would search for better set if your looking......"
R2M4SF4EE2D1EH,2,"VERY POOR!!!! ONLY PICKS UP IN ONE EAR. WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS TOO LATE FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING. IT WAS TWO DAYS PAST MY TIME TO RETURN THE PRODUCT.  ALL IT APPEARS THAT WAS WANTED, WAS MY MONEY.  NEVER AGAIN."
R1CF15OA85SW1B,2,"After several attempts at trying to hook these up to use with the TV, we sent them back.<br />Seems it was more effort than it was worth.<br /><br />We will try TV Ears next."
R2OWM9VG8B2ZWW,5,I use these primarily for music after the wife and kids go to bed. The sound quality is far above others that I have owned. I bought the Sony version just before these and had to take them back due to several &#34;dead spots&#34; where I would just get static and they lacked range. I can use the Sennheisers throughout my house and yard without interruption. I have only had these a couple of weeks but so far I am very satisfied.  Update: I have been using these over a year now and still love them. Note: They do tend to fall off if you bend over( Very wide headphones).  Update: Three years later and still working perfectly.
R2BMIU7L4CY1U5,4,"Works as discusses.  Easy the setup and clear audio.  Headphones are not real comfortable.  Configuration is flat and doesn't fit over the ear but fits against the ear.  For the record, it is worth the money.<br />UPDATE:  Ordered SoftRound Earpads from amazon for $9.99 for two and they are great.  Are much more comfortable now.  Still like the product.  It really works"
R3U0JQFDG1VMBN,1,No it did not come up to our expectations. Returned it because they didn't work where we needed them to.
RJTZ0RM5CAQLK,5,"Best remote headset for hard of hearing. Tried several others.  None compare with the Sennheiser.<br />Expensive, but outstanding performance.<br />This is my second unit. One for home and one for vacation home!"
R3FC8PT6ZRFA0Q,5,My family could not do without these!  It is super handy to have kids put these on when you are tired of their repetitive movies!  They are very easy to work and provide excellent sound quality.
RQEORFQZFTJ3D,3,"We previously had use the TV Ears but when we bought our HD TV, we could not get them to work.  Our son told us about these wireless headphones so we purchased them.  The instructions weren't too clear on how to hook them up - either that or we're really technologically challenged!!! - so we had our son come over to help.  Husband seems to like them okay - I like them because we don't have to have the TV blaring for him to hear while I'm reading."
R2IEY8K713E07L,5,"These are perfect for me to enjoy TV --both the shows and the music channels, without worrying if my<br />volume is too loud for my neighbors in my apartment building. I love having music with me<br />anywhere in my apartment."
RFE5OA8DLUN7J,5,Bought these for my husband who has a slight hearing problem.  He loves these headphones!  Sound is stereo.  The TV doesn't have to be loud anymore and I appreciate that.
R24V8LZ19IBKBE,3,"sound quality excellent but fit leaves something to be desired.  Easily falls off if you shake your head.  Also, fine tuning sound can be difficult"
R3DZV7VXCVV74J,5,"I reseached headphones to help me hear TV better as my hearing is bad.  I read good reviews on the RS120, but never did I think they would be as good as they are.  The sound is really good.  There are two controls on the headphones, one for the volume and one for the tuning to correct frequency.  The sound is crystal clear.  I did not experience any buzz as was in other reviews.  I can walk into another room and still get good sound.  Our TV was loud and my wonderful woman put up with it.  She can set the TV sound for what she wants and I can set the headphone sound for what I want.  We are both happy.  It makes all the difference in the world.  Two RCA plugs go into your TV or Sound Bar.  Make sure there are outlets for the RCA plugs."
R1I0RXF704IG6Q,5,You can spend a lot more for and get a lot less.  Very comfortable and easy to use.  Setup was a snap without any confusion.  Sound quality is what you would expect from any Sennheiser product.  I use for my PC and occaisionally with my TV--so far no issue with distance and quality of sound.
RJQDMVTA4PXE7,5,"These headphones are Great! I can use them all around the house, exercising, cleaning, and so forth, and not be tethered to one room. The headphones actually give better speaker quality than my TV that's only 2 years old! The detailed sound quality is So good that while I was watching a movie, I could hear background talking that I'd not previously noticed while watching the same movie, on TV without headphones. At first I thought I was hearing neighbors, and it threw me for a loop til I realized I was hearing every minute detail of the movie! Well worth it, a real bargain! I love these!"
R17IHDTXDRYHNU,1,"Poor design. The charger is part of the transmitter, which means the headset can't be stored by your bed where you use it"
R2PKQKLMPX85A6,5,What an awesome headset. Truly a plug n play setup. The sound and range exceeded my expectations. Thank you for such a quality piece of equipment at a reasonable price....
R39455T8GRYLQS,4,"These headphones have a fabulous sound quality. Listening to music, it sounds like you are in the room with a live band. The transmitter sends out a very strong signal, I can walk clear out to the street in front of me house and still hear it full volume. The only thing I am a little disappointed about is that they are a little bit uncomfortable. I think the main reason is because I wear glasses, and they push my ears against the ear piece of my glasses, and cause some discomfort. I would recommend them, especially if you don't ear glasses."
R15EYNCCAJO108,5,"I've always had good luck with Sennheiser headphones starting with my career in broadcasting several years ago.  I purchased these with the intent to listen to TV with better clarity.  They are serving their purpose perfectly.  The unique thing is, I can still clearly hear a person speaking to me while I have the phones on so you don't have to yell WHATTT? if your wife asks you a question about the program you are watching.  Most recent movies are mixed with several channels for theatre applications and audio suffers greatly when they are dubbed down to DVD or Blue Ray.  Many poorly mixed productions combine voice and music tracks at similar levels and become almost impossible to hear well in surround sound.  These headphones seem to cure that problem, and you don't have to crank up the volume to hear dialogue clearly.  I love how you simply have to set the phones on a cradle to recharge them...no need to plug any wires in...very easy and handy.  Also a great buy for the price."
R1UZLYFE3CU3BS,5,We just brought our newest TV upstairs for my dad.  It is in close proximity to another TV so we needed some head phones.  These were super easy to install and they work great.  My dad loves them.
R2J2OEKSU68YR7,5,I wear a hearing aid and am unable to hear dialog on most TV shows because of all the background music/noise. Turning the volume way up is not an option. These headphones are excellent. I can hear all the dialog now and I get the benefit of surround sound from headphones that are very comfortable to wear because they sit on the ear instead of covering the ear.
RTBD026J9NYV5,5,"My whole family has fallen in love with these earphones.  The sound quality is great, and we enjoy the peace and quiet they have given to us.  You can walk around the house, and not miss a thing.  My father-in-law wears them because he does not hear so well anymore.  My daughter wears them, because she can turn up the music very loud.  A great device that has come in quite handy.  Easy to set up and the fact that you can control the power, volume and clarity right on the headset is fantastic."
R398YF2GEI5G9M,5,These work really well. The best part is you can leave the room and walk around the house and still hear your TV or you could plug them into your stereo with the speakers turned down and the head phone volume turned up and enjoy the music without disturbing other people in the area.<br /><br />The only caution is to adjust the tune setting first other wise you may experience some hiss or distortion. They are easy to hook up other wise.
RP99CX9BWLO8K,5,I ordered this for my husband. He wears it to listen to the tv. Now the tv is not playing so loud the neighbors can hear it. Also I can go to bed and sleep while he is watching tv and no sound!!!
R3CM72NN636V0I,5,"My first pair lasted about five years, and I recently purchased more. I hope these headphones will be made for many, many years."
R3KMEM979MTNJY,3,There is some hissing at lower volumes. It will lose connection without warning if the output sound is not high enough and blows your ears with loud static when it does.
R1XSOHBEOQ6AHL,5,"They have allowed me to keep my sanity!  I used to find it necessary to go down the hall to my bedroom, 30' or more away from the TV in the breakfast room, close my bedroom door and watch my own TV with volume turned up to hear over the TV in the breakfast room.  Now I can sit next to the person wearing the headphones, use the mute button on the remote control and still be able to hear from HIS set of headphones!!"
R1A5B70RDX7Q5X,5,"Don't have much to compare to, but for the price I got these ($40) I couldnt be more pleased. The tuning knob has a slight learning curve to it, but once dialed in I was very happy with the purchase"
R2MG7P9H23OGZA,3,"I have two HDTV's and both have audio RCA jacks and another jack for headphones.  I have WiFi headphones and they work independently on one TV and not on the other.  On the one TV, I can listen over the headphones which do not cut off the TV speakers and on the other TV, the headphones cut off the TV speakers.  Before you buy any WiFi headphones, you better find out if your TV can simultaneously emit sound out of both the TV speakers and the headphones.  I have researched lots of headphones and none of the manufacturers address this problem."
R1E2D8U9G8WBDU,3,Everything is fine except I cannot make it small enough to stay on my head.  It keeps on sliding off.
RV39SZOTMSNKJ,5,"I purchased these for work (music, audiobooks) and they are comfortable, great reception, no interference and good battery life.<br />They aren't noise canceling, but they do block out a bit of ambient noise.  The foam pads on the earpieces are a bid fragile, but I'm careful and havn't damaged them (yet).<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with them."
R159XFREFYY4I7,4,This headset is far superior to the Sony that I had before.  Sony had proprietary batteries (actually modified AAAs) that they charged $16 to replace.
RPBR7A00WDRJL,3,"The sound on the headphones is great.  The issue I have, they do not fit snug,  and will fall off if you try to walk around with them."
R1UN85LTDEFCDL,5,"Whatever the reason for the sound loss in TV's or stereos these will definitely improve your experience while watching or listening. Turning the sound up for everyone is not the best solution but these will allow you to hear the show while in the same room or not. Good batteries, great sound."
R3NGKPVLBMG2BM,3,There is a little background hiss. Sometimes you can adjust it out sometimes you can not.<br />It is only noticeable during low or no sound moments.<br />Otherwise sound quality is fine for me.
R15GATI325906W,5,"I have very loud tinnitus and have tried various ways to cope with it.  I've had the RS20 for nearly two years.  I plug it into a 4-way selector box which has inputs from the cable box, the ROKU box, the PC and a line which I can plug into any device which has a headphone jack.  The audio quality is superb.  I can work outside. in the garage, upstairs while listening to music, radio, tv or whatever.  And no loud tinnitus ringing to drive me nuts.  Give each rating star 2 points!!"
R3DEISYRC4KX8M,5,"We ordered this because I usually have to have the TV turned up twice the volume that my husband because I have tinnitus. I wasn't sure about this at first because the way we had it hooked up, it would play a while and then lose the signal. I became frustrated and called Sennheiser. They were very knowledgeable and told us what we needed to get it working properly. I was becoming uninterested in some TV programs but now I'm back, explaining &#34;what they said&#34; to my husband. There are times when I am working on music at the piano and my husband has used them to watch a TV program. So glad we got it . . . both of us!"
R3SOAF97YEU0G6,3,"I've been using wireless headphones for some time, several years.  I thought I'd try these ones because they were highly rated.  They didn't compare to the Accoustic Research wireless headphones that were similarly classed.  The Senn headphones sit kind of awkwardly, if the media pauses for too long, there is a really loud white noise sound.  The headphones are not cupped to limit the audio to the person with the headphones on. If you're in the same room as someone else and you are listening to something else, they can become very annoyed.  To say the least, I'm still using my older Accoustic Research headphones until they wear out."
RWHWFAMYAS7GH,3,"Works as described, but too much FM static to enjoy fine music. I use it in a noisy fitness room and this is fine."
R2VF6BR8QVD14G,5,I bought these for my husband. He loves them. And he turns the TV. On in our bedroom and then sometimes brings the earphones I to the family room. As long as it is the same channel he can hear the tv almost around the entire house. They are great! I've recommended the to several of my friends.
RDLIWHZW6H56H,5,Been using the same pair for a few years now and they have held up just fine.  My wife is a light sleeper and I use these almost daily.  Great sound quality.
R3EX8JFZZ8PRQF,4,"This is my second Sennheiser head phone. I like this brand just fine, There is one dislike however. It is way too easy to slide off my head whenever  i bend over. I would buy this brand again."
R1VP14UDRJSPDZ,5,"My husband used to have his Tv so loud, he was on one end of our home and I was clear at the other end trying to watch a movie, and couldnt, now its perfect  , with his head phones, so quiet. LOVE IT"
R213KN75GXCWNW,5,totally worth the money and they saved my husband from turning the volume all the way up on tv so he doesnt lose his hearing
R1J7OTFKQJ1W7Q,3,"I purchased these headphones to replace my old Rocketfish wireless headphones so I could have two pairs of headphones on the same charger. I purchased a pair of supplemental headphones and was able to get both to charge simultaneously on the same charger with a little finesse. There is an LED that lets you know when it is charging, which is nice.<br /><br />The headphones were fairly comfortable, but they do not go around your ear and rest on your head as I prefer. Neither do the Rocketfish headphones, which I was hoping to remedy. I have found very few headphones available that do this. I hate having my ears pressed down for hours when watching a movie.<br /><br />The open air nature does allow you to hear people talking without removing the headphones, which is both good and bad depending on the noise level in the room (think noisy kids).<br /><br />However, the main problem and the reason for the lower rating (and why I returned them) was with the audio quality. For the most part they sounded fine, but there were many times when moving around that I would pass through a hole in the signal and would hear static. I tried everything I could think of to prevent this issue by changing channels and moving the transmitter inside the cabinet but was never able to. I often move around while using my headphones. Even just rocking in am arm chair can create a repetitive hissing sound. The Rocketfish headphones never had this problem. In fact, the Rocketfish ones never had static at all. When they would go out of range, they would just go quiet, which I prefer. And they would only have problems if I walked a significant distance from the transmitter while the RS120 could have problems within 12 feet of the transmitter. The two transmitters were in the same place in my cabinet and the RS120 would perform better with the cabinet door open, but I'm not willing to do that.<br /><br />So I would recommend these only if you tend to sit in one place and not move around while usingthem."
R13J3F1SMS9EQW,5,"Great cordless headphones! I bought these for my father. He likes to listen to news and other sports programs. He is a bit hard of hearing. And sometimes it was annoying for others in the house when he had to turn the TV volume up in order to listen to programs on TV. After I bought them these, everyone including my father in the house is happy!<br />He freely walks around the house at a range of about 100 to 200 feet far from TV, (I'm just guessing) , yet he says he can still hear everything very clearly.<br />It's a great buy!"
R1TFH2BSYPZ952,4,"I got these to eliminate the battle of the volume control.  My wife's got sensitive hearing and mine's fading.  They completely meet my expectations as to function.  The headphones only need recharging infrequently, and it's amazing the rich detail and subtle sounds that I now hear that I don't think are reproduced well by the TV speaker system.  This was a totally unexpected benefit.  The only down side of wearing these is that they could fit better on the head if the headphone portion could be swiveled."
RA1WFLLRJ6DM7,2,"After only 2 uses, it stopped working. It is going to take too much work and bother to try and figure out if worth fixing."
R28A3L7CU3ANYU,4,"My parents are hard of hearing and since I've gifted them with these head sets, peace has once again entered our home :)  Nice sound quality.  You do hear a little static when there is no sound, but for the price, we're not bothered!  We run 3 headsets off one base unit."
RJC93FS7NMTNC,5,"They work so well, love it much more than TV ears which hurt my ears and broke after 2 months!!  Can hear super clearly!  They are the best!"
R3EN6BP06UWIG9,5,I bought this to replace an old Sony headphone set that bit the dust and so far it's working great.
R1NDYY2C3S95C6,1,This is the second set with the same problem. The volume control dial is very sensitive and shifts the sound from one side to the other and sometimes cuts out altogether. I have to constantly play with the volume dial to get good and equal sound in both ears. I will now look at products from another company. Very disappointing.
R3HZHD4272E0ZI,5,"I have been using these for six or seven years. ( I am on my second pair, ( nothing lasts forever )) I couldn't imagine being without them. I have had family and friends buy these with my recommendation and they are all pleased!"
RP54AQU1TGZL,1,"Tried all three channels, hissing sound comes and goes....annoying with silent moments in movies.  Sometimes just turning my head causes sound to faze in and out.  I got these to watch late TV without bothering the rest of the family when I come home after my late work shift.  I'm no more than 10 feet from the trasmitter base.<br />These were a Christmas gift that I just started to use recently, so I don't think I can return them.  I'll call to see what my options are."
R2537K1O2Q9RLH,5,Sound is good and fits both my husband and my head.  Love this -  easy to setup and sound quality is good.  If I am not interested in hearing his programs I do not have to hear them.  Great marriage saver
RHALIVPCXULK8,5,"Works very well. Excellent sound quality, range and battery life. The use of standard rechargeable AAA batteries is an advantage. Lightweight, comfortable for long periods, even lying in bed. I really am enjoying this product and would recommend it to anyone."
R1U0SE5CMKW5M8,5,well i had another one just like it for over 4 years. I paid 99.00  for it and got a bargin on this one. I put this one in the Motor Home. I ware hearning aids and it sure help me to hear and understand the TV.
R1TEXWAQD7NPTJ,5,My wife uses these at night for watching TV and they're great.  I've not hear any complaints of them being of poor quality or not working.  They tune quickly and the battery life seems to be great.
R1RGORLFVGU6D3,5,"This is exactly as advertised, high quality Sennheiser wireless headphones. Excellent packaging and shipping. No complaints. I use them with an electric drum kit, as well as, my computer."
R3ECB2RZDWR3GM,1,"Tried on three tvs, watched the video tutorial online to make sure I was connecting correctly, worked with the tv  menus to be sure output was correct, and I never could get them to work. To be fair, I didn't have the time or stomach to call tech support. Sending back."
R2WJFWE55A0B2D,5,"This is my second set of these headphones and they are perfect for me. I now use one set while charging the other. I wear the headphones at night while watching TV, so my wife can sleep. These headphones are comfortable and very durable (I used 3 sets of Sony phones and they all broke) as I fall asleep with them on and I usually manage to roll over on top of them.<br /><br />I have not used them with the stereo, but the music on the TV is very clear and vibrant."
R1GBIQF1G4GOEM,3,"They work but at least in my home they are subject to A LOT of interference. Every time I move my head from one moment to the other, I hear radio white noise and sometimes if the volume is turned up it can be quite jarring. It's too bad because I like the design overall, the charger and they fit well on the head. If I am just in the right location in the room they work great but the next moment when I shift my position... loud crackles. I really contemplated returning them but for the price and for my limited use case (I plan to use them only a few times a month) I decide to keep them and just adjust my head position to make them work."
RFZVCRQVDYGKE,5,"These are by far the best wireless headphones I have ever used. Just plug them in and  WOW. Once you use them, they will be a favorite part of audio in your collection"
R45SGMX6QY4QP,4,I m very happy with this product I can listen to my music as loud as I want without disturbing anybody.
R2SW1UTPEGSKPF,5,Excellent…where &#34;excellent&#34; means 10 on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being highest. A coach who asked a player to give 110% is crazy. One can only give 100%. Or a teacher who uses an A+ grade when the scale only goes to A. I now should have enough words to send this on.... but &#34;Excellent&#34; should have said it all.<br /><br />My &#34;Excellent&#34; means if I need more of this product I would buy from you.
R3VAVW3JVEGSZI,5,"I was very impressed by these headphones.  I don't have any bose or other high end headphones to compare to, but these have the best sound quality of any headphones I've ever owned.  These were on sale for under $40, but I believe they would be worth the $100 they usually sell for.  Great pair of headphones!<br /><br />Pros:  Great sound quality, amazing range, long battery life, comfortable, easy to put on and take off charging station<br /><br />Cons: When there is no input going into headphones, they buzz very loudly.  This is not a big enough deal to lower it a star, but it is noticeable to me, since I use it with my computer.  When I finish playing a game, I need to take them off or deal with the buzz.  When there is a sound coming from my computer, there is no buzz whatsoever that I have noticed."
R1JI56OJOFIM1I,5,"it is on-ear, not around-ear and that makes it ideal for people with above-ear hearing aids. it also has pretty long reception. I can hear the tv easily 150 feet from the broadcast unit through six walls in my ranch-style home. this is the second one I have bought and the first one still works well after 8 years of usage. it beats anything I have bought in the past both for signal strength and sound quality."
R2X3R2BNP8BTNE,5,Bought these for our teenage son to avoid competing TV's in a small house. Working out perfect. Be purchase ever.
R2W0OEFIB520OL,5,"Nice fit and feel, great price for Sennheiser,  Sound quality is very nice.  I like that they are rechargable.  Thank you"
R1ND3FYDAB8E7F,4,Works well. Batteries don't last as long as I would like. I would recommend it for anyone with a hearing problem.
RNONG2SDCFY77,4,"I had an 10 year old pair of wireless headphones that I wore to listen to music while I worked around the house. I dug them out of the closet and started wearing them for listening to the TV when I was working around the house. It was nice to still be able to hear the show when I was doing dishes or in the next room or whatever. The hiss was pretty noticeable, but still range was great and I was just listening to TV, so it wasn't that big of a deal.<br /><br />My mother lives in a retirement home and, due her poor hearing, struggles to hear the television (so she always has closed captioning on). I figured a set of wireless headphones for her would be a pretty cool gift and I could test drive them to see if I wanted to upgrade. So, I bought the RS120s. The sound quality was much much better than my old set. Almost no hiss at all. Cool. I set them up at mom's. The first thing we heard was a neighbor's telephone call (this was pretty much crystal clear too). I guess they had an old 900MHz telephone. That was only the first night though. After that, it wasn't a problem. She struggled with the philosophy of tuning the headphones to the base thing, so I bought her a set of the RS160s (and I took the RS120s).<br /><br />The RS160s weren't as convenient for charging (she has to plug them in as there is no charging stand), but there is no tuning involved (you just have to pair them, but that is not hard). Another key difference is the RS160s are over-the-ear headphones (an outer foam ridge that goes around the ear), not on-the-ear headphones (a flat foam pad that lays on the whole ear) as with the RS120s. You can see the difference when you look at the pictures, but none of the reviews I read mentioned this. This is a huge difference to me. Over the ear headphones cup your ears and stay on if you lean over. On the ear slips off even if you bend slightly forward. Major pain when you are working around the house. Unfortunately, while the RS160s don't suffer from this same drawback, they don't have the same range as the RS120s - they sound absolutely great when you are in the same room, but start cutting out when you get much further away (and since they are digital, they don't just get more static, they cut out).<br /><br />So, I compared the size of the ear pieces on the RS160s with the RS120s and they were pretty close. Close enough that I decided to drop $12 and buy a set of replacement RS160 ear pieces and put them on the RS120s. They got here today. It was a breeze. I just pulled the old earpieces off of the plastic piece that fits into the phone and put the new ones over. They are slightly bigger and not exactly the same shape, but I put a couple pieces of cellophane tape to hold them onto the base before I put the earpiece assembly back on the headset. You would never know they didn't come this way. Best of all, they stay on and I get the range of the RS120s. Why Sennheiser didn't make them this way, I have no idea. So much better.<br /><br />Link for replacement ear pieces below.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DEYA5UO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
R2YHQRQYHT3EN8,5,"Love these headphone. Lightweight, great sound!, stays on my head, good reception and a great price.  I highly recommend them."
R1GEDIKLSO4P2N,4,"Easy to set up and use, great sound.  The only con is that after a few hours they get a bit uncomfortable."
R3I5MFDRTNNFQH,5,"I don't know why these get any negative reviews.  They are fantastic.  I hear things I had no idea I was missing.  So what if you have to tune them in, set the volume and hang them up to charge.  It is no big deal.  I guess some people were born to whine."
R2YNRLKAQGZDZ6,1,"I like the idea of the soft ear phones, however, I couldn't get them to work at all.  Good idea though."
R1RYEU9K3FG8ZH,5,my hearing is bad and require the volume on the television way up to hear properly which makes it to loud for my wife. These headphones do a wonderful job. I'm very pleased with there performance.
RA3G616E08II7,4,"I bought this so I could watch tv in my room without disturbing my parents in the other room.<br /><br />This works very well however its very annoying when the headphone just emits a loud static noise when it doesnt receive any audio signal. Which is only annoying when you have them on.<br /><br />I think there might be other headphone out there with better prices. However, this is still a very good headphone and I would recommend it."
R5UU0G8YY890Y,5,I purchased this item for my dad.  He's 86 years old and hard of hearing.  He's very happy with this item while walking around the house and still able to hear the TV clearly.
R190NAYEVQW1M,1,these phones work really well for my husband he likes to watch the news on tv and I hate tv so he can watch away an I dont have to hear so they work well for both of us
ROB6QM9XIDJF4,5,My husband loves the speakers.  So do I.  The volume on the TV doesn't blast me out of the room.
R38PKEUXTF4IEZ,5,"My husband likes to go to sleep after me.  So, with this headset he can watch tv in bed while I sleep without waking me up!  I am a very light sleeper and I cannot even hear the headphones next to me when he has it on loud."
R2BGHZK0IOXC5C,4,Nice sound. No hiss. Comfortable to wear for many hours.  I have used for 12 hours and  are  still  going strong.
R20T41WT0YGORN,3,"Bought these to replace another set of a different brand.  I immediately noticed that these don't fit as well as my last pair.  They're very uncomfortably tight on my ears.  Also, the band across the top, despite the padding, becomes painful after awhile.  Sound quality is good.  There's occasional static or crackling, but it's brief and my last pair had the same issue."
RMQU7LR7RLEYV,5,Works great for when I want to watch the tube but need the area to be quite for other people.
R2MICL6F1IE9O3,4,"Great help to hear if there is ambient noise in the TV room or characters in program whisper. Don't have to keep asking, &#34;WHAT DID SHE SAY?&#34; The head band does not fit very well....if you get up out of chair, the head band falls off. This is really a nuisance."
R2HBWG42IYJFFZ,5,I Love these headphones.  I use them in my bedroom and I want to purchase another set for the living room. I recommend this Excellent product!!!
R31DKGA9KTTRCR,5,"It is so good!  Battery never ran out, always had good sound.<br /><br />Now that I have inherited it, I haven't found a use for it."
R35ZLDD2KLS2Y0,4,"Good:  Has controls for both volume and adjustment (sensitivity or tone).<br />Not so good:  Easily slips off, if you tilt your head.  The fit is tight enough for vigorous exercise on treadmill, but not tight enough for the slings and arrows of daily household chores."
R2TGLQSKLL7BQI,5,"Not do they work fantastically with the TV, but I also use them with my large computer so I  can listen and not bother another one else.  PLUS, the sound is so much better through these than the mini speakers in the TV or Computer."
RLR3BYGHQ6UNU,4,It is good to use with PC and TV<br />Not with iphone or laptop<br />Very Good sound for sure .
R366SNYJT2110Q,4,"Seems to be all I would want<br />Short one star because head set is loose on head no way to tighten<br /><br />battery great<br />sound excellent<br />Main use music, tv .<br />Fast  delivery"
R1VBDH6H2022V8,5,"I was a bit skeptical that these wireless headphones would work well, but they really do. There is a little tuning adjustment which you can turn back and forth until the hiss stops.<br /><br />From the TV to our bed is only nine or ten feet, so I can't testify as to its operation at a greater distance."
R5D92T8UYRUX7,4,"I bought these for my 90 year old Mom and she loves them.  I put them on to try myself and want a pair too.  They are very comfortable and easy to use.  I think the only thing I would change is the tuner and volume control are next to each other and for someone who is 90, this can be a problem,"
R30Y21DH4XFKXG,5,Lost my first set in house fire.  Just had to order the same ones because they work so perfectly.  Comfortable and clear sound.
R2HUG984CFI6AV,4,"My television was not equipped for external audio.  Friends with the headphones loved them, and I wished my tv had audio out."
RWNBHVZJZT5ZR,5,Awesome pair of headphones. They work great and are comfortable. I can go on other side of my house and still works. Starts getting static after about 50+ feet but not too bad! Recommedned
R2HQ0U35JPI2LX,4,"Though the headphones themselves are good but the holder is quite big and if you are planning to keep it attached to a TV, then it takes a lot of space.<br /><br />Area around the earphone is not covered with foam rather it is clothing material, so not as firm as any foaming surface.<br /><br />Otherwise overall these are decent headphones"
R2RLWK0GEWPTVK,5,"Best money I've every spent. sound is great, don't  know what all the fuss was about hooking them up ,it was a piece of cake. I can hear them any where in the house ,downstairs, in the garage and even outside."
R3R16G8RK2G3NV,4,"Works well, It is comfortable to wear,  I would recommend it to others. Headphones are well made and easy to use"
R22J1M8SOWPQW9,4,Good sounds quality and easy to hook up.  Could be more sound cancelling and material on ear pieces could be a littlemore comfotable.
R2UARDS9FSQ0IG,5,Great for TV and easy to hook up. Excellent sound. Headphones can slip off when bending forward. So I am a bit careful.
R1WOKPHPBIB263,4,I would like to have more options for input instead of just the composite red and white (black in this unit). This is a great unit and the sound is awesome.
R2U8FTLJ38PVOZ,5,"Lightweight and comfortable, and what a relief not to be tethered to my computer.  With my hearing loss, I can't intelligently critique the sound reproduction.  It does seem a little heavy on the bass, but chances are that's the cheapo motherboard sound on my low-end computer.  However it IS clear and noise/static free and I can hear streaming video clearly which is a great blessing for me.  I have wandered up to 30 feet from the transmitter with no loss of quality."
RC8M77NXC2VTA,1,"Took me a while (my fault) to get it hooked up properly, but once I got the connections right, I LOVED it.  Super clear sound, easy to see that the headphones were charging and that the signal was being sent wirelessly.  Great product...until yesterday.  Stopped charging, stopped transmitting.  Tried plugging it into a different electrical outlet to make sure.  It's dead.  It's not only merely dead, it's really most sincerely dead.  Dead as a doornail.  DEAD!  And I spent so much money to get a really &#34;GOOD&#34; brand?!??"
R2QL16TK37QULR,1,"Sorry but I've been using these for months now trying every possible angle and tuning frequency in an attempt to get these to play without annoying interference.  I've tried moving the base, hooking them up to different computers.  I've tried them at work as well.  No matter what I do, there are constant hisses and crackling noises in the background.<br /><br />Occasionally if I stay still I can get a clear signal but not consistently enough where I would even consider them for just watching TV from a stationary position."
R1WHDR1SY8N55G,5,"its all I expected, easy to connect, comfortable to wear. the time it took to arrive was very short. everything was more then I expected."
R2W0ETY8TP4TW9,4,"The sound will about -beat, the new beats headphones by cost & sound quality I have two sets, thinking about a third!"
R1PNN68AD9MDQF,1,It worked with good range for about 6 days then its range dropped  to about 4 feet. Not worth the money
R1CGLIEOVGXIC6,5,"Clear, comfy, decent volume range and works well with my computer system. Great range, easy set up. My favorite feature is the transmitting unit doubles as the charger and a convenient spot to park the headset.  I purchased a refurbished set to save $30, I couldn't tell that they weren't brand new. Only drawback, if you have a small head, they do tend to slide off if you lean over (while cleaning house, etc.) but I can't find hats that fit me either.  Convenient on/off and volume controls on the headphones themselves.  Choice of three separate channels, no problems with interference from other wireless devices in our home (like most homes, it seems most everything is wireless these days).  Over the years, I've had a couple other pairs of wireless headphones...these are by far, my favorite."
R2XBMDHT07HYVA,5,"Good sound quality and easy to install. The headphones look good and are very comfortable to wear, even with glasses. Happy I purchased this headset."
R2QATS2UPHZ2OR,2,I bought this to use with the tv. I can get it to work with everything other device but not the TV so this is another thing to put away in the closet.  I wanted to listen to tv at night and not disturb my sleeping partner.
RYCR9GYRK7SZ6,2,"Before buying, I went to a store and tried on what appeared to be a similar pair of Sennheiser's in the same price range . . . they were just fine.  The RS120 was a completely different fit -- and definitely for the worse.  The range, however, is as advertised -- as long as the batteries are fairly fresh."
RATPNRV1OIEY,4,This unit is far better than my old tv ears which i have used for half a decade. TV EARS HAS CRAPPY QUALITY.  this system is working just fine  i would advise covering the ear pieces with some cushion. sound is great  and plenty of volume .<br />wish it had an optical jack but i can deal with it as it is . so far in one week i have enjoyed the use of these phones and the wife has yet to holler at me to turn the tv down. tv can be muted while i hear just fine.Phones appear to become loose with more use but i can also deal with that . I took the covers off an old pair of Koss phones and slipped them on this set and it gives me more room and a tighter fit for the phones. I am enjoying the great sound and no more tips falling off in my ears from the old tv ears crap.
RMXKBDE901UBR,3,"I have an older set of wireless headphones that were OK, but can't find them after a move.  So I needed something reasonably priced and ordered the RS120s.  They are fine for casual TV and music and they fit my need fine.  Just need to be able to watch some TV or listen to music when working without disturbing the rest of the family."
RPPQQLUYMG5UD,4,"We bought two sets, because an extra headset cost more than the whole rig. Simple to set up, easy enough to use with some minimal attention to the controls. They are comfortable enough, though you are quite aware of them on your head and more so the longer you wear them, so - yes, less weight would be nicer."
R3A98SLYP36U7X,1,"These are the worst &#34;headphones&#34; I've ever used. They are just flat cups! They don't wrap around your ears! So they just fall off instantly. The radio quality was atrocious. Cool idea with the charging station, but do not buy these. Terrible."
R1LO939YPILV7L,3,Have to constantly adjust the tuning. Slightest movement and the tuning has to be adjusted. Would not recommend these to anyone.
R17KQ31CN3RLKL,5,"Great sound and comfortable to wear.  Be careful not to get the cord to the base crimped in a cabinet door, because it will disable your unit."
R178RIP9RNXCUI,5,"Great sound from these headphones.  Occasional static, but doesn't last long or interfere with listening to tv.  Came very promptly."
R1KLPSHY08PM6A,5,I have very bad hearing and needed a good pair of headphones to use while I work out. I ordered these headphones thinking they would work fine. When I got them and took them out of the package I thought I made a big mistake. I was going to just return them as they seemed just to cheap the way they looked to be made. I decided to try them and first and wow do they work great. When you get them make sure to try them first before you make a decision on them. I have had them now for a couple of months and I am very happy with them.
R112LS614VEJ4H,4,these took a little longer than expected to arrive but they did and they are ok. they do the job they are made for. the wife is real happy when I use them.
R1VC0Z401PYWWP,5,I'm hard of hearing and this solves my problem. Speaker systems & TV don't work $ me.<br />Setup can require a little effort.
RSBZT2QFFT9GN,5,"I love being able to watch my own programs without subjecting the rest of my family to my own personal favs.  They don't like Downton Abbey (I know, it's shocking isn't it!)  so I can now watch it in peace.  Love the ability to hear the car tires crunching on the gravel and the background sounds (birds, crickets, etc. . .) that just blend into each other when I watch tv on the regular speakers. We already own a set of these headphones with the charging cradle and I was going to purchase one more headset when I noticed that the headphones with a charging cradle was just a few dollars more.  Well worth the price as we have two televisions."
R2Z5REQS6EQT8Y,5,"I bought these and love them. I was having trouble hearing<br />tv shows with music in the background, no I hear them perfectly. Love them.No interference great sound and range, I would highly recommend them!"
R3871F31XX7DAK,5,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. I can listen to t.v.  Or not while he is watching. He loves being able to walk outdoors and still hear his music  or T.V. show. I don't have to hear the T.V. blaring all the time.  It's comfortable and has fabulous sound quality. The sound tracks from the movies are so clear it's like being in a theatre. LOVE IT.
R26FSMPWZ5IRQ6,3,"They work OK.  Sound quality is pretty good.  It has some static now and again and the headband won't keep it tight to my ears.  I'm not sure how long the headband part will hold up.  It looks a little cheep.  It does have really good range, tho.,"
R36ZMKCKKBWJAA,5,These are awesome and  very clear! Liked them so much we ordered another set  for my dad who wears a hearing aid. He won't have to wear his hearing aid with these.
R3OQPNSOLNDTX5,5,"We used TV Ears before and experienced numerous issues including line of sight requirements, static, ear soreness from extended wear (i.e., watching a full length movie), and durability of headsets (over time). The RS 120 units fit comfortably, and they perform as advertised. We can walk into another room and still have great reception. Another positive is you can leave the TV audio on for other persons who do not need the headset and there is no sound feedback from dual sources.  Additionally, this is a good price for the quality of the unit (although time will tell on this as we have only used them for two months to date).<br /><br />The only negative is there is not a deal or promotion to purchase dual headphones for the home that needs a set of headphones. The difference between a single headset and headset with base/charger is $7. A recommendation is to offer a package deal that provides two headsets with a base/chargiing unit that will accommodate (charge) two headsets.<br /><br />We would definitely recommend this product to others."
R24Z3F83MKBZAV,1,"These are the worst headphones I've ever purchased.  They fall off your head if you lean forward or backward.  They stopped working after 3 weeks.  As far as I could tell it wasn't the batteries.  They just went dead.  I suspect the on/off switch, which is a cheap soldered on board slider.  I have Sennheiser HD 220 pro  and HD 457 headphones which work well, but these are really garbage."
R2HKJ9R8UDF5LG,4,"I found the sound quality very good at both high & low ends, fit is comfortable and range  more than adequate in case you need to grab a beer in the kitchen without losing track of the game.<br /><br />And this isn't even the high-end model!  Truly a great buy."
RUXQOFED7U8KJ,5,"When your husband can't hear and blasts the TV, this is wonderful. no more fighting.  Can listen quite far away."
R2ZOM44YMNA75I,5,"I am impressed with the simplicity, effectiveness and clarity of these headphones.  I bought them for my Father who is profoundly hard of hearing..... the only way the rest of the house can stand watching TV id when we have the volume turned down but then Dad can't hear.  These allow us to maintain comfortable levels while proving acceptable volume for his enjoyment.<br /><br />Good Value. Does what it says."
R1LQWH460YRAYH,2,"The sound quality is ok, my main complaint is the ear cups are flat, not recessed to fit over your ears, so when you move or just lean over they fall off your head. Also the have to be exactly in the right position to charge, requires moving them around on the charging stand to get  charging light to come on."
R2BM8LHOE11AYX,1,Very pleased with it except for the fact that it falls off when I move my head. Admittedly I wear size small in hats however there is no option to adjust this set to even make it firm enough to hug to my ears. Can't turn up the volume because everyone near me can enjoy the music as if I'm wearing speakers. They fall off my husband also (he wears average size hats) so I don't suggest these for anyone I have met so far in my lifetime.
R2M7AIVV7XILUL,3,"Even though I ordered it back in November, I as yet have not opened the box, so I can not really comment yet regarding whether it works or not.  My hearing of words is not very good.  So I do hope it helps me to hear words on my TV without having the volume set as high as I set it now."
R1TEJ0H5PXRRP6,4,Seems(ed) to work fine.  I purchased this for someone else; they has since passed so these are in a closet not being used...
R301Q4WRLWENXQ,5,"My wife has lost over 80% of her hearing, with these she can watch and understand the TV. They are independent from the TV volume so I can turn it up, down or mute without disturbing her. She just loves them, and its nice to see her laugh at Jimmie Fallon."
R2YCMB5RSINFTI,4,"These are the best wireless headphones I have used.  The audio is exceptional.  The signal is clear even while walking around.  The charging rack makes recharging easy.  I like the on/off switch separate from the volume control so I'm not always adjusting the volume when I put them on.  The fit could be better, but they are comfortable."
RFW7F0653AERV,5,recommended by a friend<br />the sound is so clear<br />so easy to use<br />easy to charge<br />everyone should have them
R1ILC7NK2556DG,5,I ordered these because I have enough hearing loss that watching TV and actually hearing it well enough to enjoy the programs was just not happening for me any more. I was missing most of what was being said.  Since receiving the RS120 Wireless RF headphones....I can enjoy watching TV again. I don't miss any of the spoken words any more......I've had these a couple of months now......I love them.
R1D2DWX80D7YP0,5,"We have four sets in our home.  They are marriage savers for sure when one partner is hard of hearing !  And they have a<br />pretty big coverage area so we can use them anywhere in the house.  The adjustments on the side are easy to manage, the<br />charging cradle is very efficient and provides a place to keep the headphones as well.  The sound quality is excellent.  Sennheiser is the best, as far as I'm concerned."
RV30YMM5398R5,5,Still working flawlessly some years after purchase. Comfortable and great sound quality. At least a 50 foot range. Sennheiser has always been a great name in audio.
R313PTYYCX6UWQ,5,"This headset works great at a reasonable price.  I can now easily hear the TV spoken dialogue over back ground noises.  The bass is good too but not overdone.  Movies sound so much better now.  An unexpected benefit is I can keep listening to my program/news when walking into another room or outside.  Now I don't have to crank up the volume to hear the news while I'm in the kitchen cooking dinner.  My family can adjust the sound to their comfort level now while I can still hear clearly.  I have an all one level home so I don't know how it would perform in a home with multiple levels but several rooms away it still works great for me.<br /><br />They are comfortable even after wearing it longer than an hour.  So far I haven't run out of battery power, even after a 3 hour movie marathon.  I was able to tuck the charger behind my TV screen so it is nearly invisible but convenient for setting the headset in place to charge.  I love that there are no batteries to fuss with.<br /><br />I've been using this headset since early February and I'm very happy with it.  Its been one of my smartest purchases."
R18LIZTAV779FM,4,I am no expert but I can hear the dialog in most movies when I need more volume nice product
R32BM4U1NI3KFV,5,Works great...second one I bought. Other brands I have tried just did not work very good. Will tell others to buy
R17OY4HSB50KX1,4,"This is a great sounding headphone but it does not fit snugly,if you bend over it will fall off.  However,the sound is clear and crisp throughout my house."
R39WKC0KMR7F7X,5,"I am &#34;hearing challenged&#34; and have tried four sets of &#34;TV Ears&#34; which do not last and do not work nearly as well as the Sennheiser Headphones.  Headphones are comfortable, charge lasts at least a week (I use them two hours each day on average).  Also use them to listen to cable channel music without having to turn the TV on and disturb others. They are excellent!"
R1D46H901NXKRK,5,"Not very comfortable if lying on the pillow.  But, they work nicely.  I would buy again if necessary.  Certainly recommended."
R1WH2L2D00NBWC,5,"Real hifi sound, full bass, clear dialog from TV. The battery charger works just fine and batteries are easy to replace when they die as all rechargeable batteries do. Does not require line of sight to work."
R221C8WYBMFU7N,1,Husband thrilled when he got them the beginning of January.  Yesterday they stopped working.  $85 dollars is a lot of money and now according to your policy we cannot return them.  Can u please reimburse us or send us another set of headphones. Thank you.  Priscilla Joyce Farrell
R3AWEOCBKCHZ4Y,5,These headphones work great.  We bought an extra pair to go with the system and it was completely compatible.  Just turned it on and it worked.  It is nice being able to listen to the TV while the baby sleeps.
R2EAE0Z9EJ6X7I,5,My husband is hard of hearing and these earphones are wonderful!!!  I can hear the television at a comfortable level and can even sleep at night while he watches TV.
R3LVTY78XONYTE,5,I could hardly hear the TV. Now I can hear it plainly and conveniently and don't have to have the TV so load that it bothers others.
R1BG2ZUJM2BARD,4,I am able to hear sound much better. I can now pick out back ground sound as where as before I could not.
R21C5BD65GGKCN,2,"Bad sound Quality, Wireless FM is not a clear technology.  The headphones require you to tune to the base frequency."
R2R9OIUTNTANL4,4,"Batteries in the original corroded & ruined set right as the warranty was out. They served me well enough in the last two years, that I bought this one as a replacement. Very good quality sat, but replace the batteries after a year!"
RNXFGWY32VSQW,5,I love it. I can put the tv on mute and still hear the audio on my headset perfectly.I can walk around the house and still hear the basketball games! The charging station is also a good feature.
R1E823PXIU4JLJ,5,"When we moved into our house 2005 my in-laws purchased two of these headphones.  They lasted 9 years of daily use and abuse.  They were dropped on the floor, sat on, etc.  We purchased another two pairs to replace the existing set.  They love these headphones.  I think they are the best on the market."
ROVYOPHBGTQ5Z,5,I liked this headphones so much I purchased another set so I can what TV in the bedroom.  I checked out all the other ones out their and some of them are NOT cheap.  For the money this one by far is the best.  Have had no problems and the battery last for ever.  You can't go wrong if you buy one.
R25V1YO2R2AGBV,4,"I am not sure how these are faring now, but they were happily received and they liked the quality.  They were pretty easy to setup and charge."
RCPHDGJSR9I94,5,"Purchased this product after reading reviews and comparing cost etc. for my 88 year old mother who wears hearing aids and still has much trouble hearing the tv. She loves them!! Sound is clear, no static or hissing. Easy to tune. Would highly recommend, especially for the price!"
R35QFMQIGMWMN4,4,"These do the job, especially late at night when the wife is asleep. The only 'gotcha' is that it doesn't stay on very well. If I tilt my head the unit moves and will fall off. On the other hand, they are quite comfortable. All in all, I like it and would recommend it."
RVUV87D3D8K1D,5,"My husband and I met decades ago and as we are children born in the '50's and love any type of music, THIS WAS THE PERFECT SET OF HEADPHONES as he wears them around our large home and when taking out the garbage to our yard.  I wear them while watching TV in one of our spare bedrooms, family room or even at our fully-equipped home office while on the computer.  We have 4 sets for each TV and we never miss a news program while doing other tasks.  I am a retired accountant but since my husband still works, I wear them while he sleeps and I am viewing TV late into the night.  But the BEST advantage for having ANY headphones is that we both wear them in the family room, watching our largest screen TV and viewing music videos!!!  We NEVER watch a movie or music video without them.  Mrs. Gale Sirrine, Chandler, AZ"
R3H781QVTJ5B87,4,"These are nice wireless headphones.  I don't like to miss a bit of dialogue in a film or dramatic TV show, and I have a bit of a high-tone hearing loss. These headphones allow me to pick up nuances in conversations in movies and on TV without having to re-play things I didn't quite get (which annoys my wife, who probably didn't get it either but just doesn't seem to care like I do)<br /><br />The one thing I hadn't considered is that these are like ear muffs... and in the summer they get really warm(hot!) I don't know if they heat up from the electronics in them or if it is just because they hold the body heat in... but I think I need to consider some kind of wireless ear buds in the future as these are just too warm for the summer."
R30CQ6OOXH6UI5,5,"Excellent product & very easy to hook up , or the money the sound is fantastic & I would recommend this product & company to anyone."
R2HL8156DB8QZQ,1,"The wireless transmitter for these is analog! You're basically wearing an FM radio on your head. This means no error correction on the received signal, which, combined with the aggressive AGC (automatic gain control) results in constant background noise. I was shocked to find this to be the case; it's like a design from the 90's. But the worst thing about these headphones is this: after a certain duration of inactivity (about a minute or two), the transmitter turns off. I have no idea why it does this, the transmitter is not the thing running on batteries. Once the transmitter turns off, the AGC in the headphones flips out and boosts the only thing left--the noise. So you're sitting there, nothing is playing for a minute, and then all of a sudden: HISSSSSSS. Fantastic design Sennheiser, now I get anxious every time nothing is playing. I either have to turn the headphones off or get an earful of static. Needless to say, I'm returning this 1990's throwback."
R1WOR39B45RU8I,5,"I love these!  We owned TVEars for many years and though we loved them, they eventually died.  We couldn't afford to buy another set, so I did my research and bought these.  They are perfect for my husband that is hard of hearing.  He has hearing aids that he refuses to wear, so these are perfect for us.  He can watch tv and adjust the volume to his liking instead of waking the neighbors!  They are great and I'm so happy that he can watch tv and I can read in the same room and not be disturbed.  Awesome sound!  Also, he can keep them on and walk all through the house and still hear the tv."
R1SK77C35P2ZNM,5,Great product  if you have to keep the room quite while watching tv than this product is for you and it's easy to hook up
RC5A6V86EWQFJ,4,"Very light-weight, sound is fabulous. Exceeded my expectations. It would be nice if it were smaller. Hard to wear with head on pillow."
R3BCKAM64EKJFV,5,"I didn't realize what I wasn't hearing until having the RS120 to assist.  Being a fan of Sanyo Eneloop NiMh Re-Chargeable batteries, I put them in the earphones before installing those that were included.  I've used for over a month almost every evening with never an interruption for the batteries.  The RS120 Charger Cradle plugs into our Mitsubishi TV's stereo Audio Output RCA jacks & 115Vac wall Receptacle.  I like the Red light indicator on the Charger Cradle that indicates when the earphones are positioned on the cradle and charging as well as the Green light indicator that indicates that the audio signal is present and then automatically shuts off when the TV is turned off after a short time.  I have left the unit on the default channel but have changed the tuning to see if I can return to the crystal clarity and had no problem doing so.  Being able to leave the TV area and venture to the other end of the house, garage, and even the back porch/yard and still hear the TV audio is crazy.<br />  The RS120 has made TV much more enjoyable for me and probably for my bride now with the room audio volume turned down considerably.  Has been a very worthwhile investment."
R3KS6WGF37SM5P,1,Did not last long.  Replaced it with a Sony that I have had no trouble with. This review is for Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones
RZ9YDNS3LZPLS,3,sound great<br />range could of been better<br />it for those ppl who like to walk around the house an listen thier stuff
R1Z5GI2BZ37G8E,4,"For a long while, I have been unable to hear the tv intelligiblely(sp?)  The way tv shows present their dialogue with lightening speed, non-stop talking and whispered lines, I missed out on a lot that was actually going on.  With these simple to use and hookup headphones, I can now hear very clearly what the person is saying and catch alot of jokes I missed.<br /><br />Only one thing I could say that is a bit negative - - the headphones tend to slip forward alot.  I guess it is the way they are made for the head"
R2SO1DRTV9FKJK,1,I want to return it  It is too inconvienient to be practical for me.  it did not work well with my TV placement.
R114AEPIO7XB1V,4,"First off, these are great. I was hesitant at first because I had read the reviews talking about the hissing. This is not a real problem if you read the manual and keep the volume on the source high (so that the base doesn't turn off). Also, I have had no problems with the battery life.<br /><br />The reason. I gave them a 4 and not a five is that they are big. You will win zero style points in these babies but they do do their job well which is what really matters (to me)."
R38X2MX3BR7Y4V,3,"It worked great but then died after about a year of use. If these were cheaper I'd get it. But not so. They are also quite fragile. At one point I had to tape the headphones together. I will say my 8 yr old uses these but never disrupted the charging cradle, which is the part that died. It's tough. For the money there doesn't seem to be better out there. And I'm used to the peace and quiet. So I'll prob break down and buy them again."
R4NOJ8FA1HI4L,5,"I had been using an older, similar model (Sennheiser RS 65) for a number of year and it had worked very well for me. So I added two of these newer RS120 sets some months ago. They are even more comfortable and have an even longer range, through walls and even to the outside of our home. We use them primarily for quiet TV viewing but also for classical and other music. They provide very good sound and, of course, enable us to move about without losing the programming we are enjoying. Yes, we would recommend them to anyone considering such headphones. Moreover, I would caution anyone considering wireless infrared  headphones because they are only useful when within line-of-sight of the sound source. These radio frequency (RF) headphones enable the user to move about freely without being limited to line-of-sight."
R7O4XLJLTAH71,1,Item came with no instruction manual that was supposed to be included. Unclear whether it will work with our tv. Seems like item was used and repackaged. Arrived in box ten times larger then necessary. My husband is partially deaf and now losing his vision. This was supposed to improve his quality of life. Extremely disappointed!
RDZR8Q4K504J5,5,These headphones are just as described and we're very happy. The price was excellent and we've had them several months with no problems.
RCSEH0346IW65,4,"I love them for watching tv since I'm on a noisy street, but they do kinda fuzz/buzz out a few times like there's interference in the lines  and they don't really block out the traffic noise.  They just have a clear, close tv sound.  Very good for the price"
R2IHOP9H0066R4,5,I was looking for a good quality headset that would provide me and my family with controls over late night TV viewing.  I purchase a refurbished Sennheiser TS 120 - first generation product at 40 % off.  The set is well made and did not appear to be used - It arrived without the original packaging but it included all the parts and instructions that are included in a new product box.  The best part of the purchase is the high quality sound and comfort of the headset.  I would definitely recommended and re purchase a similar product from the Amazon provider
R3M76XNV3P8YTP,1,"I bought this as a gift for my son-in law this last christmas. I have owned the Sennheiser TR130 for several years and it has performed great. I would not be without it. He was not able to use his 120 till february. He complained of screech and popping sounds and it does make unusual noises that i have not heard on my set. I was going to return it for an exchange or a refund but the warranty was only good until January 29. I would not purchase this model,but I would spend the money to upgrade to a 130 as sennheiser is normally a great product. This is part my fault for not checking the unit as soon as it arrived."
R31S5D3YR1LXZX,4,"Great product, but you have to have a place to put base that is far enough away from tv that it doesn't produce static in your ear"
R1Y3VODWP97BME,5,Great Sound and looks great. Very pleased with this product. Works great for late night video games and t.v. viewing
R1NSJFB1J0YHKX,5,"I bought it for my husband who likes to wake up early in the morning and watch TV while I'm still sleeping. (The perfect complement to my eye mask). The sound quality is great. He says it sounds better than watching TV with the TV speakers.  The charging cradle is solid and the headphones fit it nicely.<br />I could easily see how this would be beneficial for someone who is hard of hearing.  They could wear the headphones turned up as loud as they like. For everyone else, you can turn up the TV volume to your preference. Or, in my case... it's on mute."
R1ECR4927G8LMB,4,I bought this as a gift for my husband but it seems to be a little glitchy when trying to connect to the tv audio. It will randomly cut out and you have to manually connect and disconnect it to switch from tv audio to headphones
R1MAWELLC9QO6W,1,Right out of the box there were troubles with this unit.  When I tried to insert the rechargeable batteries in behind one of the ear pieces the ear piece never fit on properly again.  The unit we received has very poor volume and does not recharge well.  We may have just gotten a bad one.  I plan to send it back and exchange it for another that I hope will work better.
R3GT0KYNRQMS3Y,5,I have owned another and this is far superior to. My original one.  Others have tried it and were so amazed with the quality.  I have since bought three more for other people.  Enough said.
R65ZL9DUJOY9Y,5,This is our second pair of Sennheiser Headphones and we love them.  My husband wore the first pair out.  They really help him hearing TV and make it so much easier on the rest of us who are just watching with him.
RFVFL8SMUVSBW,2,"I got these from my 4-yr-old as a father's day present a few years back. I thought they were the best father's day present possible, so I bought some for my mom for *mother's* day so she could give them to my dad. My mom never stopped thanking me because now she isn't being blasted out of the room when my hard-of-hearing father is watching TV. Another set was purchased for an uncle for his birthday. We liked them that much.<br /><br />They aren't full-isolation high-def headphones, nor are they supposed to be. I use them to put a low level of TV sound right next to my ear. The sound level is high enough such that I can focus on the dialogue instead of background noise, but low enough such that I can still hear when someone is talking to me. These headphones are more than perfect for this purpose.<br /><br />Problems reported by others:<br /> - Keep slipping off head: This one is true, IF you are trying to wear them while doing other things. So these aren't good headphones if your intent is to listen to music while doing chores or going outside. The fit is loose and they fall off when you bend over. But if your goal is to sit and watch TV they are perfect.<br /> - Tuning wheel is too close to the volume wheel: This is also true, but solvable. After I kept hitting the tuning wheel when trying to adjust the volume I put a little piece of black electrical tape over it. It is questionable as to why, exactly, it even has an exposed tuning wheel. It should be either pre-tuned or else the adjustment should be out of the way. In the battery compartment, for example.<br /> - Audible Hiss: Sort-of. Again, I keep the volume really low, so I don't really notice the hiss. But these aren't supposed to be studio-quality, and they are wireless.<br /> - Auto turn-off is useless: I agree. The auto-turnoff does turn off the transmitter (which is plugged into the wall), but the headphones (powered by battery) are left on and blaring a loud hiss. This is pointless. The headphones should be what turn off to save battery life.<br /><br />So all-in-all a great purchase. If I had reviewed this back when I bought it I would have given 5 stars. But not now. About a year ago, the volume wheel started messing up on mine. When turning the wheel in one direction the volume would shoot up, cut out completely in the left ear, go to static, and come back on. At my preferred low listening level the left ear was silent. Both ears worked at a much louder level, so I took to wearing them with the phones back off my ear slightly to attenuate the loudness. It was a hassle to minutely turn the wheel to get it set even to those levels. But I'd had it for a few years by this point, and I didn't use them all the time, so I just dealt with ti.<br /><br />And then my mom called to say the ones they have stopped working altogether. My dad sets the TV volume to \\""earthquake\\"", so she desperately wants a new set.<br /><br />Today I was looking at getting a replacement set of phones (the transmitter is still good), only to discover<br /> a) the price has nearly doubled to $100, and<br /> b) the cost of a replacement set of headphones is exactly the same as a new starter set (headphones and transmitter). I guess the transmitter is free??<br /><br />At this point I see no use in getting replacement headphones when the complete set is the same price. And if I'm getting a complete new set, I see no reason to stick with this brand and model. Two examples of this model didn't last very long, so maybe I'll give another manufacturer a shot. As for this pair, they functioned for a while and are still semi-functional. And while they worked they were quite excellent. So 3 stars for functionality, but $100 headphones should not break in such a short amount of time. So 2 stars.be what turn off to save battery life.<br /><br />So all-in-all a great purchase.

R1KIS57FAXYMNC,5,Couldn't be any easier to connect to the monitor output jack. Within a few minutes it was like I was in a theater. I could hear all the background sounds I didn't know was there. Little sounds that give a movie or show that little extra enjoyment. the stand charging unit works great keeping the headphones recharged.<br /><br />I use the headphones at night after my wife goes to bed so I don't disturb her. That way I can turn up the sound hearing all the lower registers I can't hear while listening the the TV at the lower volume.<br /><br />I have recommended these headphones to other folks and will recommend to others in the future.
R1YCR6AV2J7UN1,1,"These headphones had very poor quality.  No matter what channel or how it was tuned to that channel, I couldn't get rid of the hissing background noise.  I worked at it for two hours, hoping to make these work....but no luck.  The only way I could get the hissing to somewhat disappear was to turn the volume way down low.  But that defeated the purpose of buying the headphones, so my mother-in-law could hear the TV without the rest of us having to listen to the TV with the volume way up. I though maybe it was where the transmitter was placed.  So I reconnected an old wireless headphone set I bought some years ago for only $5.00  (Price for New on sale-normally $10 -very very cheap) and they sounded great.  I thought I was replacing the cheap headphones with better ones.  That didn't turn out to be the case.  I guess I'll go back to the cheap headphones."
RI378IGU30IWG,4,"These wireless headphones are meeting my high expectations based on reader reviews.<br /><br />The sound is good and with very little static.  I find the tuning knob to be a little fussy and not sure why it isn't on channels.<br /><br />The fit is good but is going to warm in the summer.  It is not a problem this winter in MN and actually feels nice.<br /><br />The charging caddy is very nice.<br /><br />The choice of jacks is limited and I have it connected directly to my DirecTV box instead of video receiver.  This meets most of my listening needs, but not all."
R2Q3XKXD3K673I,4,"Instructions for set up were lacking details. Until I called customer service, I was unable to get anything but static. Instructions fail to explain hook up with a cable box. Now headphones work well"
R2KC4YNXSBTEVT,5,"The headphones performed better than I expected, and arrived much faster than I could have hoped.  These are definitely the best buy on the market"
R3F00R7FHNT9M4,4,"Headphones are just fine.  Installation was just like the previous set.  My only complaint is they slide off my head much easier than the previous ones did.  I do believe the first set were more expensive and the design of the ear muffs gripped over the ears much better.  This set have a flat earpiece and tend to slide off if I bend over to pick up something.  Audio quality is great.  No real problems with comfort, quality.  An no, I'm not going to use duct tape to correct the problem....."
R20AVYND49N8Z,4,I bought these so that I could watch tv shows and movies without disturbing my wife.  For that they work great.  On occasion I will get a little interference.  They fit comfortably but I do wish they cupped the ear.  The fact that all you have to do to recharge these is set them on the cradle is a huge plus. Overall I am very happy with these headphones.
R14SM1EZERI8M1,4,"I needed a pair of open wireless headphones for the office, so I could listen to my music (at a reasonable volume) and still hear what was going on around me.  My other Logitech wireless headphones I couldn't hear a damn thing, even at very low volumes.  These sound good enough -- I'm not super serious about quality but I do find the lower end headphones/speakers to be very tiring and these I do not.<br /><br />The feel a little cheap, for an $100 set of headphones, particularly the ear-pads.  But I'm over all quite happy with them.  You definitely can hear what is going on around you.  I keep the volume fairly low in the office and they sound fine.<br /><br />The one annoyance is the tuning.  Annoying that you have to tune it to begin with, but even worse is that the tuning knob is *RIGHT NEXT* to the volume knob.  This has lead to several annoying moments of trying to figure out what is going on, why my music is soft and/or choppy.  This is made worse by the sheer complication of my music setup, where it could be: My browser being weird, my laptop main volume control, the browser software player volume, now the headphone volume, could the network be causing choppyness...<br /><br />I really wanted the digital RS 180, but couldn't bring myself to pay $250 to replace the $50 Logitechs I like, but are not open design.<br /><br />I'm very happy, but in a world of reasonable $25 Bluetooth or $50 bluetooth+USB wireless headphones, I kind of expect more."
R1OPW4VHX2TOGV,4,I've been using TV Ears for several years and was amazed at how much better the Sennheiser headphones worked.  I can use them with my hearing aids which is much more convenient.  We bought the headphones for my husband as well and he now enjoys watching TV much more now that he can actually hear all of the dialog.  The only issue I have with the headphones is that the ear piece falls off occasionally.  It snaps right back on but it should not fall off so easily.
R32K52G89SRW66,5,"Compared to my old headphones, this one is a winner. I like the recharge option and the range is very good- I can go to every room in my house without interference. Easy to set up too!"
R2GB87GF13FU65,5,My purpose was to utilize the headphones while I was outside on the patio or back yard.  I wanted something that had a suitable range ( 50 -100 feet) and these work perfectly.
RHASRHQM77GG2,5,"This headset works great with TV sound!  My uncle loves them...and easy to use!  Wireless, so definately worth buying!  Great for seniors!"
R30EVAZR3F7M9Q,5,"I used to use closed captions and plug-in earphones so as not to disturb a renter upstairs. I don't need closed captions anymore. The sound is so clear, and speech understandable. Considered Sony, but after reading reviews on internet decided on these. Very pleased.  Dick L."
R2SK6AVVII8VRH,3,"Sound is clear.  Separating the tuner and the volume more would prevent detuning by mistake.  Perhaps move the volume to the bottom of the earpiece and leave the tuner on the back.<br />Over the ear is best for me as I enjoy listening to Pandora as I work around the house.  The Stennheiser fall off my head when I bend over, my Sony set does not."
R1CAO4C8YGII9R,3,"I really like the style but it seems to cut out when adjusting the volume,if it dosnt clear up ill send it back."
RIA9R1R77SNYX,4,"Use it to listen to our Tv, and it works perfectly, with no sound distortion or gaps. The recharge stand is so easy to use even in the dark. I am not totally in love with the ear pieces, which sit on one's ear as opposed to surrounding it. Something I'll get used to. Anyway, the bottom line is I now enjoy watching movies on television as I can hear what is said - well, mostly! A good buy!"
RGBWQNKV3L5ZC,4,"After extensive research, I selected Sennheiser headphones due to the quality of sound received.  Ease of tuning and fitting on my head.  I would recommend this wireless headphone as the one to buy.  The sound is so clear."
R3KACV671J8XR,5,The headsets are great . Best reception I have found for my home. Competitive products were poor reception when walking around or moving at all. Excellent product<br />Pat C
RMLCB9UU7ZJV4,5,"A wireless headphone with good quality and excellent feeling. Friends, do not hesitate, please enjoy it as soon as possible!"
R16TKJRY6W8NZE,1,This device has a rechargeable battery system.  After using the headphones for fourteen months the system failed.  Now I don't have a useable set of headphones and have to buy another set.  This time I will not cut the cord but stay attached to my amplifier.
R3DPTB3RCN76UA,4,"Great sound as long as you keep the TV and surround sound down to a lower level. Otherwise the sound is like being in a barrel.<br />The head phones do move around and fall off if you tilt your head down, as most people have reported. Still I do not think this is a reason not to purchase. Fixing this would solve the biggest fault that I can see.<br />Easy to set up once I found the right way to plug in to the TV without cutting off the TV sound.<br />The sound does come through well even though I am two rooms away...I was surprised, not that this is big issue for me.<br />This is definitely a good buy for me and I would give my recommendation to anyone who needs this type of relief."
R33PAQCYY9ARWK,5,"My boyfriend stays up way later than I do and likes to watch tv in bed. I cannot sleep with the tv on. For months we were trying to compromise, making each other miserable. We didn't even know headphones like this exist. Now all of our problems are solved! I knew my boyfriend wouldn't use headphones unless they sounded just as good as the normal tv speakers. He's picky about things like that. But these are absolutely crystal clear. And they are comfortable, too! Just tight enough to be confident they will stay on, loose enough that you forget you're wearing them. He has started wearing them when I blow dry my hair, too, so he can still hear the tv over my hair dryer. I would have paid double the price for these."
R1U84C5WFP8Y7O,5,"Great set of headphones easy to install ,easy to charge,great sound have had other phones and these are by far the best."
R2K5I4CCU6Y73P,4,Good range and overall good quality (for an average user like me).<br /><br />Hiss when there is no sound input is very LOUD.
R1CWUX2P6DFX50,4,"My ears don't hurt after a few hours of wear, sound is great and they are so easy to hand up on the charger. My last set had the charging connections at the bottom of the earpiece an it took a lot of playing around to get and keep a good connection. The only problem I've found is when you loose the sound signal for a while, you get a lot of static like when you are searching for a new Netflix title. you have to turn off the headphones until you start the next movie."
R33O9LJED44SI,5,"I previously had an infrared headset but it burned out.  This one was easy to install, had clear directions, and has excellent sound quality.  It was shipped quickly.  I'm happy with it."
R35CU8TS5OC9ZD,5,My hearing has deteriorated over the years and I couldn't understand but about half of what was said on TV unless it was so loud that it could be heard in the yard. I could hear the sound but couldn't understand the words. With the RS-120 headphones I can finally understand the words much better.
R11NDREVXV07D3,1,HAD IT FOR 3 WEEKS AND UNABLE TO HOOK IT UP TO MY HOME THEATER SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE RESEARCH BEFORE PURCHASE
R3QAYVLE64ZYYK,5,"I love these headsets.  Clear and good range.  We are both a bit hard of hearing, me more so,  even though he wont admit it.  :). Hubby and I generally do not watch the same TV shows so I hang out in my woman cave and have the TV as loud as I want with these on.  When I want to watch one of his shows with him in his cave I simply tune my TV to the same station and still be with him in the other part of the house."
R1XATUVX6BQP7N,5,"We purchased this headset for my father in-law for Christmas. My husband has a gaming headset for X-Box, which I swear saved our marriage. We had a (loud) family gathering and my father in-law wanted to focus on a particular program on the tv. Instead of turning the set up, he used my husband's gaming headset and muted the tv. He was blown away! Loved it. So, for the holidays, we bought this rechargeable headset for him. He has never been happier! I think it was more a gift for my mother in-law b/c now she doesn't have to listen to programs he is watching while she is doing something else. The charging cradle is great, too!<br />This headset allows you to really hear every sound that you normally don't hear.<br />Fantastic."
RZA5UUYB55WX1,5,"I use these in our home theater every night to watch TV or movies without disturbing the family. In the past I have tried so many pairs of wireless headphones and never have been satisfied. Either they were too heavy or the sound quality was bad and had a static sound to them. These are great, they are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and sound excellent. Very glad I purchased these headphones!"
R1XLKCL3UOLZYF,5,"One member of my household has poor hearing...invariably the volume of the television gets higher and higher as time goes by. With this wireless headset, the volume can be set at a comfortable level for all. I am running these through a stereo receiver out of the headphone jack. The great part is that if I am not watching the television, I can turn off the speakers completely, while the headset can be cranked as high as needed.<br /><br />The signal is very good, no background noise. You can dial in the signal on the headset; there is also a three-setting channel changer on the base for optimum signal. Just teach the user to be careful when taking off or putting on the headset not to accidently turn the tuning dial."
R2TMDSLPBQ92WU,5,These are really good headphones for listening to TV. Sound quality is great and the fact that they have a tuning button as well as a volume button lets you really focus in on the signal. We keep the transmitter on the bottom shelf of the video cabinet under the TV (which puts them near floor level). I have had them on and walked from the bedroom around a corner into our kitchen and could still clearly hear the TV in the bedroom without static. I once accidentally left them on around 7 a.m. and didn't notice it until about 9 p.m. that evening - they were still going strong. Amazing. I would definitely recommend these headphones.
R3JBQJ1E8WC83L,4,"These headphones have good sound, I replaced mine with the RS 170 and was disappointed. These headphones sound better. Save your money!"
R3ICXLF9X0IXVU,4,"I've only had them for two days. My own error, I didn't click all the thumbnails--these are over the ear headphones, but not cups, and I didn't catch that. I prefer cup headphones so I can have that seal and since these were not that style, they were really uncomfortable for me (pushing on tragus/forward helix piercings).<br /><br />That being said, the sound was pretty good considering they had no seal. Definitely not something I'd use in a library but for watching movies late at night and not wanting to disturb others, they're perfect. I never tested the range/battery life though so unfortunately this isn't a lot of help."
R35C0L6XL7YWTN,4,"These are very good headphones.  They would have been 5 stars if (1) they were over the ear instead of on the ear.  They would be more comfortable and would let in less outside sound. I can't imagine that they couldn't be over the ear without much extra manufacturing cost. (2)  They are a bit heavier than I anticipated. (3) The volume and tuning controls could be positioned better.  It is easy to accidently nudge the tuning wheel and lose reception.  The wheel has to be carefully and slowly moved to get the best reception.  I like them the way they are, but I would love them if they had the 3 points I have mentioned."
RNHBSK0AN954G,3,"I haven't used it yet.  I need to go to Sennheiser's web site to figure out how to connect the plugs.  They include everything else in the instructions except that one important particular.  This is what the instruction sheet says &#34;Establish the necessary connections.&#34;  Period. Yeah, big help that is."
R2XQIDAJPPIHQX,5,My father loves being able to be outside while listening to music or the news without having to be near a TV.  They come through loud and clear.
R1E2M0X0343TLO,5,"This is actually the second RS120 wireless headphone set that I bought from amazon.  The first one was 3 years ago and it is still working flawlessly. In fact, I loved the first set so much that I ended up buying a second headphone to use with the base. I bought this second set to use for my bedroom TV.  So now I have 2 bases and 3 headphones.  What I love about this set-up is that each person in my house can wear a headphone and then simply adjust the tune dial on the side to choose to listen to the living room TV or the bedroom TV.  You can use both at the same time without interference by just making sure your bases are on separate channels.<br /><br />After using the RS120 for 3 years, I have no complaints about the function at all.  The headphones have great range. I can be in the basement - or any other room of the house - and not lose any signal.  I can go outside on the deck or driveway and still hear the TV inside.  Once in a while walking outside or from room to room you may hear a small bit of static as you move about. Usually if I hit a dead spot with static, all I have to do is move ever so slightly and get full signal again.  In other words, the dead spots are so small it is very easy to avoid them. In fact, you have to try very hard to find a bad spot and stay in the exact place where your signal is dead. This, of course, is putting it to a very hard test because most people will use them sitting on a couch or chair in the same room as the TV and none of this will be a factor at all anyway.<br /><br />The only thing I would change if I could about this set is that the headphones are rather large and a bit heavy.  I'm sure this is due to the batteries and wireless receiver they have to put inside the headphones, but perhaps the newer updated models have a lighter, smaller feel to them.  But the weight is definately not enough of an issue to keep anyone I've showed them too from wearing them and enjoying how great they sound.  They really enhance my TVviewing and allow you to hear much of the subtle audio and background music much more clear.  I really don't watch my TV (especially movies) without them anymore.<br /><br />One last note... the batteries that come with these headphones have been amazing so far.  After 3 years, they are still going strong.  They hold a charge for at least 4 hours of continuous use. I can't exactly tell you how long it takes to fully charge them, because I just store them on the charging base when I'm not using them anyway.  If you do this, they will always be ready to go when you want to use them.  I have never had them die on me while using them unless I had left them off the base for a couple days and did not charge them between use."
R3IU1QH2EWDELM,5,When wearing the headphones I don't need the TV's closed caption.  I'm hard of hearing; these phones receive loud and clear.  My wife uses in the bedroom while I am sleeping.  I would recommend to anyone hard of hearing and anyone whose wife watches TV into the wee hours of the morning.
R20O3PWX9FGPYE,5,"Living with someone who loves TV all day long can be a challenge.  I like quiet until the 6 p.m. news.  Friends boasted how their lives changed by using these headphones!  I was convinced and it's the best dollar ever spent.  Push Mute and the headphones still transmit all the sound!  Like majic, I have peace and quiet all day.  He couldn't be happier with the quality of sound!  Buy It!  You will have no regrets!"
R2Z166KCH1AT0Y,5,"Just recently bought it used. Works perfectly, and it lives beyond my expectations. It has a slight background noise, but it disappears when music is turned on.<br /><br />For the price range, it is very impressive."
RN7YEY8PENGQ8,5,son in law loved this for christmas. great product for a great price. fussy son in law and met his expectations. YAAAAAA
R383AM5HHRRS2M,3,They have terrific sound but slip off my head whenever I need to bend to pick something up.  Seems like they are made for bigger headed people.  Any suggestions?  I strongly feel I should return them.
R18GYP1ZOQ9SFB,5,"I sit up and husband wants to sleep so I decided to try a wireless compromise.  These are great.<br /><br />Originally ordered the Sony MDRRF985RK.  Various set ups on the Sony never produced transmission.  Pondered a bluetooth adapter and headphones but really wanted the single and seamless charging option than RF provides.<br /><br />Ordered the Sennheiser RS 120 and LOVE IT.  Nice long cables, easy set up and after tuning it got instant clarity and can hear TV on the headphones throughout my 5000 square foot house.  I did the cable box option so husband can hear TV if he wants.<br /><br />Am THRILLED."
R12P9WTEAVB4LQ,5,"This is our 2nd order of this product.  Out first was several years ago.  My husband (who is hard of hearing) uses it in the den.  Then, this past Christmas, I thought he would enjoy having one in the bedroom.  The sound is awesome.  You can walk through the house with the same superior results of sound."
R2V7UBSFHVA2OV,3,"I enjoyed these wireless headphones even though they were much heavier than advertised.  I had to tie a cord around the back side to keep them from slipping off my head whenever I looked down.  They performed well and could hear my source anywhere out in the yard around the house.<br /><br />What I'm disappointed in, is they failed just three months past the warranty period.  Totally dead.  Tried new batteries, different audio source, different channels and no good.  Not even any static as you could normally hear off channel or with no source.  I would expect a product costing this much to last a couple years longer."
RH126GY6WM4FS,5,Bought this as a gift for my husband but for selfish reasons.  So I could read in the quiet comfort of our bedroom. But these are great. He is very pleased and I would definitely recommend them.
R1XA58VN0P7CCC,5,"Peace for me as I can't stand the television blaring. My husband wears these while I am reading and he said it is better than just the TV, that it sounds like a high quality stereo. So we both win because I can have my peace and quiet."
R1LJYPSJ20P26Z,2,"This wireless headphone was a good one in the first month. But after a month, the sound became noisy and the transmitter started to stop transmitting randomly."
R3MIYSFB5U2CIV,4,One negative. The head phones don't fit tight enough and will fall off when I lean forward to pick something up.
R3HDOQLU5DTWZI,5,"I baught these for myself and I have to fight to get them away from my husband. The quality is way above what I expected, well worth the costs. Thank You for quick delivery also. Lisa"
R2V58UMDY7MWA4,2,"I wanted to like these headphones but I had to return them.  Sennheiser makes great &#34;cans&#34; but these show that the old 900mhz style just don't cut it today.  The headphones pop and hiss no matter how close or far away I am from the receiver.  The fit is also very tight and was not comfortable after about 15 minutes.  My hat size is 7 1/2 so I have a decent size head and they did adjust to fit me just fine, if only they weren't so tight.  Sounds quality was actually pretty good if they didn't pop.  I stepped up to the RS 160 2.4GHZ model and can go anywhere in my condo and they are as clear as can be."
R2E2S7FYKTYYBL,4,When you rate so many items in one day it is not my ability to write a long lenghty description why I like a product suffice it to say I like this product according to the number of stars 1 stars i could not use it 3 stars I do not use it enough to rember 4 o5 I continually use this and reread and recommend it to others ok?
R3IJFGPOMWGEZ9,4,I really like these.  They make watching TV & movies much nicer.  I can raise the volume to a level where I can hear easily and my wife can comfortably listen to a lower level volume on the TV or surround sound.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that I didn't receive the model I ordered.  I ordered the model that uses an optical digital connection and received the model that uses the RCA connections.  I just didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them when I was satisfied with the performance of what I'd received.
R3GPAPS3BS6YIU,5,Gift<br /> I guess it worked out cause the dude I got them for dogs em. Nice job senheiser. I have a pair of their headphones I like.
R111XH1CVBICLD,5,"Got this since I seem to find it harder to understand what I am hearing on my TV.  This headphone is very clear. I can now hear every word clearly. Also surprised at it's range. When I get up and go to another room forgetting I have it on, the sounds come in clearly from a distance.  It does exactly what I wanted it for."
R2EKMI591A6WTB,2,"My wife purchased these for our 10 year old son as a gift recently. He really wanted a wireless headphone and after looking at reviews and being convinced by a coworker that these were a great brand, she ordered them. When they arrived, I helped with the unpacking and setup. This is where I began to form a negative opinion. They felt cheaply made and not something worth $100. Then we realized that the base had to be plugged into a wall outlet and that it wasn't mobile like we were expecting. Our son then complained about all of the steps that had to be taken to get it to operate and poor sound quality.<br /><br />We actually just returned them. Perhaps a good bluetooth headphone doesn't exist at this price point, but I didn't feel that these were worth any more than $50. They actually had the ever so familiar Chinese made feel to them and not the quality feel that we told that this brand was supposed to be."
R2952F5L9CXI7G,3,"I've given this headset  a 3only because it seems to be for a mans head. To big for my head. Sound is wonderful, a bit heavy. I would have sent it back if I could have gotten smaller set with same quality."
R3KJC4PAT973JY,5,They are fantastic in performance  just like the offer promised.  I was able to go three rooms away and not miss a word from my TV.
R2FR0KIYYUT25J,5,I could not believe the clear sound coming through the headphones because I had read some reviews that  said they had a hissing noise.  When my husband uses these I can have the TV at a normal level or if he watches while I'm in bed I don't have to grit my teeth while I try to go to sleep.  I love them!
R2LV34550YKBBE,5,We have a set of these and I can mute the TV and hear my show while my wife listens to the radio in the other room.  Very convenient!  I even bought a set for some friends as a Christmas present and they love them.
R1Y5J9G53RQO0K,5,Got it for my father who works 2nds and would get off at 11p and would like to watch tv in his room without waking my mom. He loves them and uses them nightly.
R2RXDFHRQJ9LE1,2,"for the price they are very sub par, and does not do what they claim, would never buy again.  Buy a lower cost brand they are better. You are paying for the name with these."
ROT3BD9NQ7MPO,1,"Don't waste your money in this thing. First of all is only analog, it doesn't have a optical audio input. Second, it didn't turn on the second I plugged in.<br /><br />I'm sure there is something better."
R3IIVPUYH0LRDR,3,"The unit works as advertised, however, the flat shallow Muff is on ear and does not line up with the slope of my head.  No comfort for me.  Since I don't use daily or for long periods, the headphones work for me. I would not recommend to a friend unless they tried them on first."
R237LBSM2IO64K,1,I TRIED DIFFERENT STYLE HEADPHONES LOOKING FOR COMFORT.  I WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE<br />FIT OF THIS HEADPHONE BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT SIDE TO OPERATE.  I AM A SENIOR<br />CITIZEN AND IT IS JUST TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO CONTINUE WITH THIS.  I STILL HAVE THEM AND HAVE NO IDEA<br />WHAT TO DO NEXT.
R1988G5PI9RCDT,5,It's a very good product.  It serves me well listening to the television without interference .  It is easy to operate and I love the battery charging.
R3JG7ZAOSGFOAM,1,"I can't get them to work but it's a hassle to send back. Not a fan at all. If you know how to make them work, please help!"
R2PDU5NY4I1273,5,"Having some hearing loss at 64, I use it for watching TV.<br />They are so clear, I now understand Brittish, Irish, Southern and even Ghetto."
R30C215JCEU3LK,5,"Just love these Headphones, Have three sets of them now.  Everyone who tries them likes them. We have a very large room with high ceilings and these Headphones make for good listening."
R2PUNJ87DO7O7F,1,"I've had this for over a year now, and while I'm too lazy to return it, I've gotta say it's not the best.<br /><br />The transmitter is very weak and, evidently, the receiver is in the right earphone.  So, the transmitter needs to be very close by, definitely line of sight (not in a cabinet), and on the right side.<br /><br />The design is beyond stupid as well.  The transmitter has a fixed frequency, but the receiver must be tuned by a knob by you.  Now, kiddie walkie talkies have mastered this problem back in the '50s, WTH were these guys thinking?  The tune knob is very easy to move when handling the headphones.<br /><br />Finally, if the audio source stops for more than a few seconds (like between vids), the 'phones blast you with static.<br /><br />When the stars align and the winds are favorable, these do work and sound good, so I don't bother to return them, but I think just about any other brand would be a better choice."
R1ZZRG02V1MI87,5,"I bought these for my live in mother-in-law who watches tv all day with the volume up high.  Finally, I have peace and quite in the house."
ROE7X042I0GQ2,5,"Purchased to give wife some extra sleep, being that we are on different schedules.  A bonus here is that the sound quality is well beyond its price, plus, one can walk around all over the house and still hear the TV.  Not huge but but listening to the news while grabbing a snack is okay.  Downside?  Phones are a bit wide for my head and not adjustable that direction, and can fall off when lying prone.  I still give them five stars.  A small tip:  Don't start laughing/cursing at the TV with phones on.  Dead quiet of the bedroom will be interrupted and likely wake the spouse, thereby defeating the point of purchase."
R3SLVYXIVXMU1X,4,My husband loves it and I love the peace and quiet. Will recommend  it to others. May even purchase a second one for out 5th wheel.
R1ZGV7GWDI6E2V,5,"Fast delivery and good price and the Sennheiser  brand has always served us well.  This lets us keep things quiet while viewing an action movie.  We've never run the battery down but do replace it on the charge stand when not in use.  We've recommended this to friends and they are happy with them too.  And yes,  my hearing is not too good so this really helps."
R3BQ1DNI8BTC4G,5,"Dad loves it, uses it to watch tv, and Netflix. Told me it works well. Can sit late at night and not bother anyone that tries to sleep."
R2LULKLH4ZDPTU,2,"I had a fairly inexpensive pair of Radio Shack wireless headphones that worked great but the padding around the ears fell apart.  These way more expensive headphones have to be dialed in to get the best signal.  I can get a decent signal....as long as I don't turn my head to the right any.  When I'm in bed using these headphones, I'm only about 15 feet away from the base."
R1ZIMISZDN2LA1,5,There is no static noise and the sound quality is excellent.  I can walk around with it on and still I can hear and this is particularly good when I am listening to the evening news and cooking dinner in the kitchen.
R2I0CE4LLY4RYV,4,"These are great for running on the treadmill but taking them out in the yard to mow the lawn, which was my main reason for buying these, didn't work as well."
R1JMTLWPOXNYU0,5,My husband uses them he says it makes him understand what they say on TV better and he can adjust the sound. This way he doesn't have to raise the sound on the TV and blast me out of the room. They are great wireless Headphones. We would recommend them highly.
R3AXEQJQNSSDP1,1,"I bought these for my husband to watch television in bed - we could not get them to work.  We did not have the headphone plug-in on the television, but my husband tried several work-arounds and nothing worked.  Had to send back."
RUSBJ44THY1PP,5,"After using units from TV Ears and JVC, this one is far and away the best. Just wish I'd found this one first."
R1OU1LTK9FOGC6,4,The headphones arrived when promised.  The connection to the flat screen TV was simple and the headphones sound great.  My only complaint is that after an hour or two of use they become uncomfortable from the natural heat buildup due to the ears being covered.
R3BCBU5GAQVV70,1,doesn't work as expected. there is interference and stop working suddenly even after following manual explanations of use. turned on/off intermitenently.
R3LT1DB9TZIAEE,4,Bought these for hubby and read all the reviews and picked this set out!  Sometimes they just have a mind of their own and loose the signal while watching tv!  On the whole they sound awesome!!!
R2GYLW6CNKGSJM,5,"Bought these for my husband, who has a hearing problem from working in a coal mine. He loves them. I should have bought them along time ago."
R3OB4YEEB72HSI,4,"This was a fantastic buy, wife loves it as she can watch TV as I snore away. Great purchase, love it."
R25MZRRASQTJPC,5,"I have tried several different pair, and compared to them, this one has earned 5 star quality. In the first place I am nearly deaf. I have to have good ones to keep from disturbing other tenants. I use to own 2 pair of Sony which were great as long as they lasted, about three years.  These are comparable to them. I can watch TV in my living room or bedroom with one pair. In the bathroom too.<br />As I said I've tried several different pair and these are tops. They deserve the 5 star rating. They are not unreasonably priced. Try over $200 for the under the chin where it hurt my ears to plug them in. No thank you. These are comfortable, have great sound and I can go from room to room just as they said I could. As a person that is quite nearly deaf, they are a life saver. I hope everyone tries them. They are great for the price and I have no complaints at all. I bought these from Amazon and the delivery was fast and good. They are as advertised.I give them a 5 star rating because they deserve it, and I should know since I've tried several different brands and these were tops. Thanks..."
R1Q7BHD6LBV480,5,"the headphones proved to be absolutely perfect... this is the third set I have tried- various brands. It meets every criteria that a person with hearing impaired needs- comfort, fidelity of sound, ease of use,,,,great and thanx for asking."
R1Z0KVH2RBGFZT,5,"Received on time, works great, unlike some things ordered elsewhere......Beats the heck out of TV ears.....Got tired of them breaking which is why I switched."
R3HWI9HCQQ71H,4,"Good sound quality, nice price.  Seems to have a good range although as one gets farther away static starts to develop.  Very happy with this purchase."
RBKQMS45R64FP,5,"my wife loves it, very clear sound-fast shipping"
R3MSNC7N9D743E,5,"Our house is an open floor plan with the second floor open to the first and the TV right is right in the middle of the first floor.  If one person wants to watch TV and the other wants to read, talk, sleep, or just veg, there is no place in the house to escape the sound. These headphones are awesome for everyone.  The volume and tone controls on the headphones work great and the sound is as clear as coming out of the speakers.  The best part is that I can walk anywhere in my house with these headphones and the volume and quality do not diminish.  They are a tad loose on my head, but I have a small head."
R1SCWO4OLKSNF8,1,"when i received the first shipment, it began making crackling sound which was very annoying. The seller contacted me and asked me to send it to Sennheiser company and they would send me a replacement. The second headset was also defective, right from the first day. I am very disappointed. i have paid for a product that is dysfunctional and useless. PLEASE DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT AND I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS."
R2PMNP54D2JPJV,1,They didn't work! I received 2 different pairs and both were defective. The a/c adapter will not plug in to power them!
RJL899O8EOQW9,2,"Update: Our second pair did the same thing about a year into ownership.<br />Can no longer recommend.<br />Previously: These headphones have just suddenly stopped working....seems to be the transmitter, even though the power light still comes on.  We've had them for just over a year, and they were used a LOT. The battery charge lasts a long time and the sound is great. There is a little bit of hiss, yes, but tolerable, for sure. The range for these headphones covered all over my house....two rooms away.<br />I was told it would be a $20 to look at these headphones, and it would not be likely that they are repairable. I am buying another set regardless. Pretty sure it's out of limited warranty.<br />Anyhow, assuming they'll normally last longer than a year, these are great headphones. It's crazy how hard it is to find wireless headphones for tv."
R7PHY2FY4I6JW,1,"As pointed out on the other one-star reviews, I received these headphones and plugged in the A/C adapter to the transmitter and  the transmitter failed to power up.  It was also very difficult to plug the adapter into the transmitter. The plug does not seat properly. I went on line to get technical help from Sennheiser and ended up paying $25 merely to chat with a technician who simply told me to return the product to Amazon.<br /><br />I am a disabled veteran with a hearing deficit, I need headphones to watch TV; so I returned the Sennhaiser RS120 to Amazon and ordered a better set of headphones from Sony.<br /><br />I might add that Amazon has a very good return policy which allowed me to return the defective headphones via UPS at no cost."
RBF7IS00LNAI2,2,"I bought this for my husband so he could listen to his stupid reality shows on tv and I wouldn't have to hear them.  However, he rarely uses them because they lose the signal or something and then he gets a burst of REALLY LOUD static in his ears. I used them once and the sound was great, like having surround sound."
R1FWM3ADQRRGU1,5,"Good product.  Comfortable, after learning to adjust it for my pleasure.  Only had them for about 3 weeks and have no issues.  Seem to hold a charge very well.  I put them on the charging cradle after two or three nights of watching TV, no problem, and I am sure that they could go longer without a charge.<br />I highly recommend them as an inexpensive headset."
RAGP5K24NHNSH,5,"These headphones deliver an outstanding crisp, clear sound. I can move from room to room with no disruptions or distortion. Volume controls the earpiece is easy to access and adjust.  A perfect choice for someone who requires the volume to be louder than the rest of the household can tolerate or likes to view television without disturbing the rest of residents.  The price is very reasonable for such a high quality product.  I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone.  They are amazing."
R1AR8SO3VD5209,5,When we are on a cruise I love to use my time to read and my husband  enjoys watching TV. It was wonderful that I did not have to leave the room  when I wanted to read and  he  had the TV on. We will never leave home without it. It cut off the sound of the  TV and he could hear it clearly on the headphones.<br />It took a little time too find the right plug in on the TV but once we did -  they work great.
R19UCZTQ15D71X,4,"I bought these headphones primarily for gaming, but I also wanted to have hifi headphones for when I wanted to listen to music. For gaming they are great; comfortable, good sound (although not booming base), and they work for hours without needing to charge.<br /><br />For music listening, I am still trying to get them set up so that there is no hiss when the music is quiet, and to get ride of the random bursts of static (not bad enough to notice while gaming, but distracting when listening to music).<br /><br />I gave them four stars because they work great for the primary purpose I bought them for, and because Im not sure any RF headphones are better as far as the static/hiss issues."
R31X54K33QTE7M,5,It's awesome headphones. They are very easy to install and works out of the box. I would recommend these to all insomniacs.  Your spouses will love you for it!
R8WPO6S9I12NT,4,"The reception is generally very good.  When I get some static or light buzz, I adjust the frequency dial and it almost always corrects the problem.  Sometimes it also helps to raise the volume on either the TV set or the headset, but not both.  I find that just about every issue with sound quality is a matter of tweaking the frequency and volume (so that neither the headset or the TV has too much or too little volume).  My only issue with this set is the fact that if I use it for more than an hour or so, it can feel tight around my head, probably because the frames of my glasses (over which the ear muffs must fit) are thick.  I think this will get better as the headset gets used more and &#34;stretches&#34; open.  Overall, this product has solved a major problem in my house because it allows me to enjoy late-night viewing without keeping my wife awake."
R1ELFM0FEBOI6J,5,"I bought this product in 2009 and took it out of my junk today because now i have a baby and could not play the TV loud. I was amazed, still works great, no problems whatsoever. If anyones looking for wireless headphones, this is it! trust me."
R2VHXG40BU95VY,4,"I bought the wireless earphonee for two reasons .first to listen to Tv without disturbing my wife and to listen in other rooms to ball games and sports shows. I believe the range will allow me to sit on my patio in the summer and listen to ballgames which is a big deal to me easily 100 feet from my living room TV. I also was able to hook up my IPAD to the wireless headphones and listen on my treadmill. Not great sound but not bad either. the quality of the equipment is very good and the included accessories are sufficient to hook up with most electronics, so I'm satisfied. It was a little pricey but the overall quality and ease of use probably justifies it. I don't know of any other similar product which costs less. So if you want to listen to TV in bed and not bug your companion and also listen in other rooms or within 100-250 feet this is the set for you."
R1RD2ECDRTW012,2,The product is comfortable but there is a lot hiss and the sound quality is poor. Have a hard time trying to tune in on the right frequency.  I would not recommend this product.
R120IYVEDB94H,2,"I love love loved! these for 3 months. Great reception, comfortable, easy to install. But...one day I went to answer the phone and barely pulled them off of one ear... then silence. Never worked again. Big disappointment. Too fragile for the price I paid for them."
R1TYAC03XFR6EU,4,"Product is all as expected.especially helpful is the ability to hear the Tv in other rooms of the house.  Line of sight is not necessary for earphones to work well.  Earphones are slightly heavier than expected , but this would not be a negative were I to need another set."
ROFCVPGC0DTHH,5,I purchased these for my dad as he is a big movie fan.  The sound is great and he is very pleased with these headphones.  These are a must have!
R1G0SFDIDKZXQE,4,"Like how easy it was to set up headphones,<br />After 24 hours of charging, I tried the Sennheiser unit and liked the quality of sound and how light the head set was. This Sennheiser unit far exceeded my damaged headphone in sound quality and range of reception."
R2VBFKN1VSCJ7D,2,I had to return this product because it DOES NOT work if you have a plasma TV.  No place in the item description does it say that.
R27TNM5XSFM2HS,4,I used this wireless headset for my recordings.  It works great.  A word of caution the headset only work after receiving an input signal.  If they lose the signal they go silent.
R3OYW1NJQTKUXP,5,I have had these headphones for a couple years and the batteries still remain fully charge.<br />The quality is great and they are comfortable to wear. The only negative comment is that they<br />sometimes slip easily while wearing them.
RQXI9W5DGEMTB,5,"Brother asked for these for Christmas.  I bought a cheaper pair in a dif brand...he sadly asked me to return.  Told me all the guys at work had this brand.  Used my prime, shipped right to him...got a call saying how nice they work."
R20FYFG802VPDX,3,"The headphones slip off your head too easily,a design flaw.<br />Too susceptible to potential breakage.The sound quality is<br />good but wouldn't buy again for that reason.Would also tell friends."
R118XEY9DLF13N,5,"Plugged it in, charged the headset by hanging it on the base unit the turned the headset on and put them on my head.  Sound was clear right and good right out of the box - no fiddling with channels or tuning required.  The TV had left and right RCA jacks on the back that the base unit plugged in to and the volume on the TV (in our case) had no effect on the headset volume.  We could mute the TV speakers and the headset user could still listen at their desired volume.  The instructions warn about placing the base unit near metal shelves or metal reinforced concrete walls - we placed the base unit behind the TV so that it would be out of sight and it still worked fine."
R3VFIDRVOHNN9H,5,We've a set of two headphones that perfectly adjusts to each individual.  Range is excellent enabling freedom of movement indoors and out.  Its sensitivity picks up sounds that enhance viewing.  Especially great for older people and those who are hard of hearing.
RYDYXK7YX15QM,5,"Tried this item on recommendation from two other friends.  I am rather hard of hearing and had trouble both with hearing and distinquishing words.  With the Sennheiser RS120,  I can hear very clearly and I now know what is being said. It also gives my dearsd wife some relief from having to be over whelmed by the loud sounds from the T.V. It is a God send to me and I  have recommended it to my<br />brother in law who is very hard of hearing.  Thank you very much.<br /><br />g"
R3OC3IE1IVTCAX,5,Didn't know anything about the Sennheiser RS 120 Headphones. Only that I wanted to buy a set for my inlaws since they got a new TV for Christmas. My father-in-law is blind and gets all of his news and weather via some type of audio broadcast. He has rated the<br />RS- 120's excellent. Claims the clarity is beyond anything he has ever heard and now hears every word. I tried them myself and was very surprised with the sound and could roam about the house with no loss of signal. I would recommend this set to anyone. They are super.<br /><br />T. Kemp
R2J2RYEXFOLGM2,1,Right out of the box this didn't work. Plugged into wall socket and no lights came on at all. I am returning it to Amazon tomorrow for a refund. Do I have to buy a $300 set of wireless phones to get something that works properly? Even the higher end ones are probably made in China as well. This is cheap looking and has a cheap feel. The less expensive Sony and Brookstone models worked better.
R1GON8J7EPRC6T,5,"I bought these for my mom who is hard of hearing and does not like to turn up the tv volume to loud due to her neighbors. She loves them so much. These high quality headphones replaced the poorly made TV Ears which we had bought repeatedly over the years. The TV ears wear out, require expensive battery replacement frequently and do not sound nearly as good. I recall buying a new TV ear set every three years and repalcing batteries more often.  My mom says the TV ears signal faded if she turns her head. She really likes the increased range of these Sennheiser headphones so she does not miss a bit when she walks to the kitchen or bedroom."
R3H51XJZ5238ZS,5,Really pleased with the results. Sound quality excellent. Works well with my hearing aids. Amazed at the sound from a distance. Can leave the room and still keep in touch with what is transpiring on the TV. My neighbor had them on and went next door to his condo and could hear the TV clearly on the headphones. Only drawback is if the mobile house phone rings while I have the headphones on you will get a very loud interference in the headphones.
R1FZYCW77MB48Y,5,Works great. easy set up. great gift. my dad loves it and my mom loves not having to listen to my dad's tv programs.
R2SAVEKTD1UVCR,5,"This is the best set of headphones I have ever owned.  I have a  slight hearing problem so I have been using different headsets for years.  I have used Sony, RCA, and TV EARS.  The Sennheiser RS120 are absolutely the best.  No hissing.  I can walk around my house and the sound is clear in every room.  I took them out of the box , charged them up,  and they  worked perfectly.  I feel like I have surround sound all around my head.  I highly recommend this headset to everyone."
R2YAAV3CUPPXWW,3,I expect mor from Sennheiser. The materials of yhe headphones are cheaper. The sound is médium quality. And it has too much interference at no more than 5 meters in other room. I must recognize that its not too expensive. But I insist I´was expectin better sound.
R9LA9Q1QY6XD8,2,"Okay, the fit part is subjective. If you're using these headphones for staring in one direction, they probably work okay. Otherwise they're just way too loose. Even on the smallest sizing which puts them up far too high, they fall off constantly. If you're moving your had a fair amount (like going from paper work to your monitor), they fall off. There clamping force is just ridiculously weak.<br /><br />Static...  Do not, I repeat, do NOT stop listening to something. The moment you do, you will be deafened by a burst of static at deafening volumes. Aside from the there's the random static bursts that happen every minute or two.<br /><br />Overall, they're junk and relegated to watching TV late at night so I don't wake up the house. I've gone back to my wired headphones with the 10-foot cable that's constantly trying to kill me. At least they stay on my head and don't squawk static in my ears."
R1N6RRTYQO5YMT,5,"I was having trouble with hearing some movies where the background music is too loud, and the talking was too low, or whispering. After I read the reviews, and decided I wanted RF and not infrared, I decided to get this product. Glad I did, because it's GREAT! No wires across the floor, I can walk around and even go outside and still hear the dialogue. I don't think you can work out or exercise if your head will tilt a lot because it will slip on your head. I don't use it for that, I just watch tv or listen to music so no problem. I can turn my home theater and the tv sound completely down, and just listen with the headphones. (Plugged into the RCA red/black OUT connection on back of Samsung plasma tv). I think the weight is ok, not too heavy, and I like the volume and on/off switch on them. They recharge overnight, never have used up all the battery juice so far. I had NO PROBLEMS setting it up, it was easy and straight forward. No issues with tuning or interference from other equipment either. Now, late at night, I can listen to tv, hear the dialogue, and not bother anyone else in the house. COOL!"
R1QKCUDSSYPZDQ,5,"need something that i could use to watch T.V. at night in bed without waking the wife, i have owned sennheiser headphones and the quality is always top notch, these are easy to set up, and have built in rechargeable batteries that charge once you place the headphones on the cradle , great sound and easy volume controls and channel changing  options if you get static on one channel you can switch to another,<br />keep in mind other electronic devices will cause some static in the earphones, so place them away from other electronics.<br />otherwise these are fantastic."
R22G3E5KQAAVHZ,4,"I've got a hearing problem so watching TV is hard unless I turn the volume way up so when my last wireless headphones were worn out i decided to get this product line as they had good reviews. After having them for a few days I'm really happy with there proformance BUT, the only draw back that I have found is there is a little bit to much bass for my liking and I was use to an over the ear so will take some time to get use to them just on my ears. The design of the cradle/charging dock is great as the headphones drop right into place for charging."
R1ALQS9FKT6NH,2,"The sound quality was adequate.  It seems good when very close, but reduces when the distance increases plus there was a &#34;hissing&#34; noice at the greater distance."
R1A3RS24BFR9OL,5,"Ordered these rather than the TV ears which I've tried before.. They didn't last and the ear pads must be made from gold spun fiber.  These pick up all the voice, music and sounds I never heard before.  I really enjoy TV now and I don't have sore ears when I'm through watching night time DVR TV.  Sennheiser makes a fine product and the price makes it even sweeter.  Thanks both of you.  I sure enjoy my new ears.<br /><br />Allow me to add this bit of info.  If you're a cable user or satellite like us, plug these into the audio out RCA ports.  Much better sound and you won't have to take the TV off the wall like I did.  Learn from my mistakes.  We'll be taking these to NC in a couple months and will do the same there.  These are good for hearing impaired folks like me.  Go for them."
R2OLSFK81KWL5J,5,We have had other wireless headphones that did not work well at all.  This one was easy to connect and is working great.
R3PVH5R0CP53MG,5,"I purchased these for my wife and she loves them.  They were very easy to setup and have very good sound quality.<br /><br />Sometimes you have to tune them on every use, but that consists of adjusting a dial on the headphones. This could really from the dial getting bumped when being put back on the stand. Overall no big deal.<br /><br />Overall a great product."
R27FT62CQ47PFO,5,This is the second pair I bought. Love them!!! Good quality and now the tv doesn't have to be so loud that the neighbors have to hear it also. My husband wears them all the time. I bought the second pair for my son in law so he can watch tv in bed after he gets home from his afternoon shift but my daughter can still get her sleep.
R1NNGWIUDI0EV6,4,"I am hard of hearing and wanted to try something for my TV, it does work great, however, if you have 2 of them which I do one upstairs and one down if you do not turn off the cable box you get both signals and cannot dial one out."
RW7W0YRJWQM5E,5,Bought these for my husband who has trouble hearing the dialogue on many shows.  These headphones have such great stereo sound.  You can even go to another room and not miss out on the action.
RQE2CZNPI2MSV,5,"After several failed sets of junky TV Ears, I finally switched over to RF headphones.  They phones have a great range, I tested them at 100' away and the signal was just as clear and crisp as if I was still standing in front of the transmitter. Battery life is excellent, as I only have to charge them about once a week.  The only downside to these is that they are a little bit heavy, and don't fit as tightly on my head as I would like them to.  Since I don't really move around a lot with them on, that isn't a major drawback."
RE7O2JLNNGRDS,5,I  purchased the same wireless headphones over 10 years ago and they still work fine.  We wanted another set for a TV located in another room.  Very happy with the product.  these also help with hearing loss.
RRUAQA0GIYBNB,3,"Pros:<br />- Easy to set up and get working<br />- Good range<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Slight hiss on quiet sections (apparently this is a thing with wireless headphones though)<br />- Will fall off if you bop around too hard, but otherwise comfortable.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />For me this was the most important part and ultimately what led me to return these. The sound was very clear. My dad put them on and remarked on how amazing the bass was. However I seem to have been spoiled by my regular earphones, the dirt cheap  Panasonic RP-HT2 Stereo Headphones. The bass on those is incredibly rich and powerful. The Sennheiser phones in comparison felt sort of weak and less full. I kept finding myself turning the volume up to compensate, but of course it didn’t make the sound any richer, just louder.<br /><br />So if you’re not terribly worried about sound experience they’re perfect. If you’re concerned about sound quality, especially bass, then depending on your tastes they may be not quite right."
RQ6VJUEWXZ9HH,5,They are extremely easy to set up. Good quality make and great sound. Very comfortable and I have owned several over the ear headphones and was nervous about purchasing on the ear headphones. No worries because they are more comfortable than the over the ear phones I own now! I bought 2 and my wife enjoys them as well.
R3W2FPQ0LKOZ7V,2,I got these thinking I could connect my phone wireless through Bluetooth. Instead You have to plug your phone up to the charging cradle. You cant go to many walls away from the Cradle or you'll just get static through the headphones. Not worth it and its old technology.
R3FB9ZS42VQMEX,5,"I am hard of hearing and despite hearing aids needed the volume loud when watching TV.  That's not great for other people, nor ideal when the grandchild is sleeping, etc.  With these, the &#34;out loud&#34; volume can be whatever is right for other listeners, and is separately adjustable on the earphones.  Further, the sound from earphones - at least these - is clearer than room sound, despite some good speakers from a home theater system.<br /><br />This may help some others, though not strictly part of a review:  my home theater receiver has an earphone outlet, but when you use it, that shuts off sound through the speakers.  The only other source of all sound is through HDMI output.  So I purchased a  J-Tech Digital (Registered Us Trademark) Premium Quality Hdmi To Hdmi + 3.5mm Stereo (RCA L/R) Audio Extractor Converter [Electronics] from Amazon.  I put this in the path of the receiver to the TV set.  It extracts the audio from HDMI (as well as pass through all the HDMI signals) and provides it as input to the headphones.  Perfect."
R1OL8Q2LKEBQK7,4,Did alot of searching and checking reviews. My husband uses headphones when he goes out in hottub and kept buying cheap pairs.  Was tried of hearing him complain about them and yes even throwing them.  Well these are the BEST!! He loves them grat sound no static and no he hasn't thrown them once. As a matter of fact he says I should of bought two so I could use other pair. Well I use his cause I get up a lot earlier. Shhhhhhh!  I am glad I did alot of searching for right pair.
R23EMV3LAPEKBT,4,"A repeat purchase. Excellent sound and very useful for watching night time TV , when partner wants to sleep and not get disturbed by the TV sound. Very easy to connect and totally maintenance free.  Would be happy to recommend to others."
R1B0N9NQ9AMUH4,5,"Got the earphones as a Christmas present for my Son, whom lives with me, and he loves them, can wear them all over the house with no problem listening. I love them, because now I don't have to tell him to turn down the sound.<br /><br />If you looking for a wireless headphone that is comfortable to wear, these would be worth the money!"
R2DG9ENBSVRTY3,2,"The headband is adjustable for length the ear cups don't swivel.  They applied too much pressure to the front of my ears while barely touching the rear, which made them very uncomfortable to wear.  I had a pair of Sennheiser RS 140s which did swivel and were comfortable but they aren't available any more.  I returned these and upgraded to the RS 180s."
R3HTDJP84192JH,5,"Wife always yelling to turn the volume down on the TV !!!!  Getting older and the eyes and ears don't work lie they did.. This unit was very simple to install to the TV.  Headphones are comfortable but the Unit is the best part.  Transmits very well and clearly,  hear things and sounds that I haven't for years.  Would recommend to my Veterans buddies"
R223H621I5WFSU,4,"I was not impressed and had multiple problems when I plugged these directly into the TV.  Including static and losing signal altogether after about 15 mins.  However once I plugged them into the back of the cable box, they worked great.  Sound quality is really good.  Oh, and a single charge lasts for hours.  The only complaint I have when wearing these in bed is that I have to be looking straight ahead, you cannot turn your head to the side due to the bulky ear muffs.  I imagine that this is true with all headphones though, not just these."
R3L2S1NWZTAKKQ,1,Spent lots to get this for my husband and it won't work! It is non-returnable if it has been opened so it was a waste of money
R2X7VROI7Y50EE,5,"It was gift for my sister.  She hasn't stopped raving about it.  She lost her hearing in her right ear and the headphones allow for listen to programs, hear dialog without background sound interfering"
R1NSDV13DNJL8O,4,"This was bought as a Christmas gift for my husband. He likes to watch tv well into the evening and it was hard for me to fall asleep. He doesn't use it often, but when he does, it's great. I can be in bed next to him and not hear a thing through them, which is great. It's loud enough for him to hear his sports just fine, but I can't hear anything. I love it. We haven't had any issues with sound quality or range, which is nice too."
R3A6LYVK3STI16,5,"When I first purchased these for my mom, who enjoys watching television after midnight, I did not realize how great they'd be.  The sound is no different from using wired headphones and we have not experienced any interference except for the one time my father decided to test how far away you can go and wore them outside to the park a block away.  It was very easy to use on our plasma TV.  I plugged the two cables into the output area and that was it.  They're comfy and easy to use.  I'd say they're worth the high price."
RUU8KDVJE3DW0,1,worked great.....but......falls off your head!!!!!  left earpiece stopped working ...probably from repeated episodes of falling off my head!!!  expensive mistake.
R3GLDAVYFZXN31,4,"We are pleased with the Sennheiser ear pads -- the sound is excellent, they are comfortable to wear, they are sturdy, and they are good looking."
R1HZVGKHBQRCJQ,2,"I bought this item because I live in an apartment with fairly thin walls and like to watch TV at whatever hour I choose while not disturbing my neighbors. (Fortunately, the neighbors on either side are also very quiet.)<br /><br />Up until now, I have been using a corded set of headphones and I grew very weary of the cord which, true to Murphy's Law, would find everything it could to snag on and be quite annoying. (Of course, if my life depended on it snagging, it wouldn't snag on anything! Again, Murphy's Law)<br /><br />These wireless were the answer and the only negative thing I can say is that occasionally, there is a 'popping' sound but not so often that it detracts from all the other benefits of owing them. The sound quality is really good to my aged ears and the frequency response is very good. They are light, comfortable for extended wearing and I can move around the apartment and STILL listen to the news. Plus, I can listen to music with the same concern for my neighbors.<br /><br />I recommend these to all save for audiophiles.<br /><br />March 8, 2014.<br />So, now that I have used these for a while and, while I still recommend them, I think Sennheiser should have engineered them a little differently with regards to the placement of the tuning wheel and the volume wheel. They put them on the same side and it is very easy for one to think they are changing the volume when in fact one is actually detuning them which doesn't take more than a millimeter of turning Then one has to fiddle with the tuning again. Not to bad when it is NetFlix streaming or a DVD but I watch Jeopardy and have lost some audio content. Better to have put tuning and On/Off on one side and volume. I am certain there was and 'engineering' reason for the choice but wait, they are engineers and I think capable, no?<br /><br />The other item goes back to my comment about \\""They are light....\\"" Yep, they are, certainly if one defines light (as I did) in the pressure they exert against one's ears but, don't bend over or you'll be picking them up off the floor, hopefully the rug.<br /><br />Otherwise, still a great value for what they deliver.<br /><br />August 11, 2014<br /><br />This is a further update to my earlier reviews. While they deliver very decent sound (caveat: I am NOT an audiophile), the design leaves a lot to be desired. There is still the issue of the tuning wheel and volume wheel being located on the same side and tho' I mistake them a lot less, it takes special attention to turn the correct one.<br /><br />But, the biggest problem with them is that they fall off very, very easily. A combination of more tension coupled with some sort of 'cup' that would sound the ear and prevent this would really improve these headphones. As they are now, they suck (pardon the language). The other day, I arose from my couch rather spiritedly and they simply flew across the floor. Trying tilting one's head to eat a meal while sitting in front of the TV... don't!<br /><br />Now, I have learn to compensate for this by putting a sweat band over them, should one have to do this.<br /><br />If I didn't loathe my wired headphones simply because of the cable itself, I would return to using them. They are comfortable and they DON'T fall off at the slightest inclination of the head. They don't go to static noise when I mute the TV for some reason. I have down grade the stars from 4 to 2 and basically, I do not recommend them. I wish I had research further and had more money to have spent on a GOOD set."
R3LWY7PLSOP4Z1,5,"I had gotten a set of  TVEARS, really uncomfortabe and  hurt my ears. A friend told me about the Stennheiser RS120, I ordered them, best order I've made in a long time. Really easy to put on and keep on, very good sound and I can walk into another room and still hear the TV."
R1LPIHEZJJ8XC6,5,This set of wireless headphones and transmitter has been a great choice. The sound quality is very good and the transmission distance is great. I can mow my whole yard front and back without ever having any sound or transmission loss. I do believe I'll be ordering and additional set for other family members.
R3OX4A6MY5VB2E,5,"Reason to get these, the ear cups are not closed so you can hear something of the real world if you are not blasting them.<br />Get the 120's over the 110 cause they charge on the stand.  I wear these all day and night and they don't break, they just get loose on your head.<br />I guess it depends on you head size, I am 25 inch and they don't fit tight to begin with,  I have had the really good ones the Panasonic 5.1 and the RS170, to tight, can not hear outside of the program and the volume has to be up for you to really enjoy them. If you need just basic stereo headphone for the TV get these. Oh.. also check the back of you TV and make sure you have audio out red -white or red- black. If not all is not loss as there is a &#34;FiiO Coaxial optical to R/L audio converter&#34; and set your TV to PCM Output, however the small box itself can be finicky and it more expensive option to get these sub 100 dollar headphone to work."
R15SECBCASH4XH,5,I can go anywhere in my house--even the garage--and hear what is on TV. Ideal for when you want to watch/hear something on TV and someone in the same room doesn't want to watch/hear. Great quality and value.
R3U3VJP9FT13C1,4,No hiss good sound quality . . . the instructions could be clearer but once I did a Google Search I better understood and they work great.
R12V61QWR1U6G3,5,"This is actually the second set I bought so you know I like the product. I wanted something for my TV, because I was having trouble distinguishing conversation from background sounds. This helped a lot, enhances the sound (even if you aren't having a problem), plus you can turn off or mute the sound from the TV (although neither is necessary). It works great with and comes with all the necessary plugs for the TV, radio, stereo or computer.<br />It has a very clear and excellent sound although for serious music buffs, I would think a more expensive headphone would be a better option. It has a wider range (100') than the usual 30' that many headphones advertised. It worked great as I walked around my condo - no static or interference.<br />I personally have no issue with the fabric covering on the earpiece and have worn them for several hours without a problem. I do however slip them off when a commercial comes on to &#34;mute&#34; the sound, but you can just switch them of as well.<br />There have been a couple of negative comments on the fit and yes there is a small issue with that, but the head band is designed to sit further back on the head than normal (look at the headphones from the side). Properly placing them on the head and adjusting the extension on either side fixed most issues I had with the fit.<br />I bought the second set because my partner wanted a set of headphones as well. You can buy the headphones separately without the transmitter/ charger but it seemed silly for the little cost difference because you would need to keep switching the headphones to keep them charged. Then I found a bonus - with two transmitters two people can listen to two different audio sources at the same time by using two different channels (switch on front of transmitter) and, if necessary, adjusting the tune wheel on the headphone. The volume on each headphone can be adjusted independently to your personal preference. These are not noise cancelling headphones so you can hearthe phone ring or talk to the person next to you in a normal voice even if both are wearing headphones. You can only hear sound coming from the headphone if you are wearing them or if the volume is turned way up.<br />A negative - volume and tune controls are too close together but that is a very small issue. For the price this is a great set of headphones."
R1P2K5IV5IFBAA,5,After a lot of research we decided on this product. It has great range and holds a great charge. Fits nicely. Definitely recommend this RS120.
R18XG5RAKSLDAL,5,"I replaced my Sony wireless headphones with the Sennheiser HDR120 headphones. They work great for watching TV when she is reading or doesn't want to watch my show. The sound is good, they ate somewhat comfortable on the ears but the sony was more comfortable. All in all I think the Sennheiser was an upgrade to me."
R3BU95Y78YO5J0,4,Works well and easy to set up...  I was surprised as to the quality of this unit but it is Great...
R1JGNULX4Z2XVC,4,have had a pair for nine years. new pairs ear pads not as comfortable. still in all a marriage saver.
R26CMR1LSRF1DG,5,"This was my third purchase of a RS120 system.  I've bought them over the years, so Sennheiser know when they have a good design.<br />All units are still working although one head set should be replaced.  At least one unit is used daily.  The three RS120 are attached to different units (radio, phonograph, computer)."
R1U793BKRJSTCF,3,"I haven't used this as much as I had thought I would, because there is quite a lot of static in it."
R1H15Q506VTPHH,4,"My wife likes to watch TV in bed.  I cannot fall asleep with TV on.  Regardless of what show is actually on.  I cannot seem to tune it out.  Now she can watch and I am not even aware it is on.<br />Very clear sound and decent sound quality.  I say decent as I am a headphone geek . . .so these will not match those.  But for TV and movies?  It is great sounding.  Much better than a bedroom TV is from across the room.<br /><br />I did not give it the 5th star as I do not think they are super comfortable.  They are not uncomfortable, but to me a flat pad is never the best design (as opposed to a donut shaped pad).  But my wife says they are SO comfortable she loves them."
R1ER2HFDYL47TG,4,I'm not a good one to rate this product because I have to use it over hearing aids.  The sound quality seems to be good but I wish it had more padding
R2IMBDV2S8J08Z,2,"I have been using Sennheiser's HDR130 headphones for a while and needed another set for a different purpose, but after getting these (refurbished) I wasn't able to keep these tuned into the transmitter very easily.  These use an analog dial to tune the receiver, and after a few minutes they needed to be tuned again - it was as if the dial needs to have better position retention (too easy to move).  The ear pieces are also smaller so they don't fit comfortably over my ears."
R1UA4E1S7R296K,5,Great headphones for the price.  The sound is amazing.  I'm using them with a TV I own and they work flawlessly.  Setup was very simple also.  Highly recommend them.
R361XKWKTPBWK8,1,This item did not work at all.  Nothing but static.  This was given as a gift and the return policy expired before it could be returned.  This was a total loss of $80.00.  Do not buy this product.
RITY2ZCE7E45W,5,I got these because I had to turn the TV up louder than my wife wanted it so I could hear it. Now I can hear it perfectly at MY volume and she can listen to it at her volume. The added benefit is that I hear sounds I never heard before! They are very comfortable and easy to control. Highly recommended!
R31VXQQ586ZBT,1,"I am a huge fan of wireless headphones, and we have used a pair for our desktop computer for years. Since we live in a 2-floor condo, we really need something that has a strong range, which definitely rules out IR. We tried a couple different models of Bluetooth headphones, but again the range usually couldn't make it across floors. We have previously purchased RF headphones from Radioshack, and when the last pair died after years of faithful service we went with this pair of Sennheiser RS120.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- the signal was strong and clear both in and outside the house, and across both floors.<br />- Batteries are easily accessible<br />- Headset charging stand was easy and surprisingly well designed (you can basically toss the headphones on the wire arms and it starts charging - not picky on placement at all)<br />- Decently comfortable<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Auto-shut off --&#62; this was our deal breaker, BIG TIME. I have a difficult time typing and listening to music or videos at the same time, so I will often pause media when I need to type. After a few minutes, the headphone base would shut off automatically, sending BLASTING static into my ears. Not wanting to give up so easily, I tried to get into the habit of shutting off the headphones when paused. However, the base would have a hard time &#34;waking up&#34; from its shut-off state, and the signal would often not start broadcasting until media was playing for 5-10 seconds. After two weeks of use, I starting getting auto shut-off (and the blasting static that accompanies it) when a video WAS STILL PLAYING, even after trying to tweak the balance between the headphone volume and the system volume.<br /><br />I found I was starting to get apprehensive wearing the headphones. You have a click and about a 1/2 sec between the auto shut-off and blasting static, and I was anxiously awaiting that signal. I felt I really gave them a good try, but sent them back to Amazon for a refund. I'm truly disappointedthough, since I have been extremely impressed with Sennheister microphones and receivers. I think these headphones would be excellent if they have a toggle on/off switch or the ability to shut off the auto shut-off. As they stand now, I find them unusable."
R1C78YE7AA8324,2,I ordered this to replace one that was two years old and stopped working.  This one was not as good as the original.  There was constant low humming or static.  The return was very easy and credit issued immediately.
R1S05BYXH0UN5V,5,"I bought it for him, but I am the one who got the great deal. He watches his sporting events in silence!"
R2QIOP7JN76PXV,4,"They are loud and clear at two rooms away.  Probably too much music for me.  I bought them because I am hard of hearing but the speech is only pretty good, not great."
R2U5HGV8UZ45M9,4,"I got these and the RS130 hoping one of them would be comfortable; one for home and one for work.  These press too hard on my ears and cause discomfort after an hour or so.<br /><br />The sound is fine but wouldn't satisfy an audiophile.  I don't find any difference in audio quality between these with manual tuning and the RS130 with automatic tuning.  Either will drop out occasionally when I move my head in the wrong spot, even though the transmitter is less than 6 feet away.<br /><br />Beeps VERY annoyingly and too long whenever it's about to shut off due to no incoming audio.  Who needs these stupid beeps?  If it just did a quick beep beep, fine.  If you could play audio while it was beeping to get it to recover, fine.  No, and no.  If you play audio it does recover, but not until after all the damn beeps, so why all the damn beeps?<br /><br />Next time I'll get the Sony's, which I had before and were more comfortable, but which failed after 10 years."
RWJ0PVQ0OZ4O0,5,"I bought these wireless headphones for my husband, who has been difficult to convince to try wireless. He LOVES them and told me I did a great job in choosing them! Super easy to set up and the range is awesome. he can listen to them with no interference 2 floors below the stereo they are connected to."
RR9BTSHOUQAUR,2,"I was so excited about getting this wireless headset only to be sorely disappointed when the product arrived. First, there was no adapter (as promised in the description) and it included regular AAA batteries (that were dead), not rechargeable (as promised in the description). Interesting in that it comes on a charging cradle and you can't recharge regular batteries. I contacted Amazon who told me to contact the manufacturer directly. I attempted three times to contact the manufacturer with no reply, not even an acknowledgement. In the meantime, Amazon did offer a partial refund if I desired to keep the headphones. The refund was the same amount as it would cost to go but the necessary adapter and the rechargeable batteries, so I decided to take that route. Well, the headphones work now, but they are very tempermental and have lots of static even when trying to fine tune them with the tune button. Not a very happy person with this purchase."
R3BDT56TUZR29X,5,"These headphones are wonderful.  These are replacing the TVEars which are super uncomfortable.  Also, with these headphones, you can move about the house.  The TVEars require that you be in a straight shot from the transmitter.  My only complaint on the Sennheiser headphones is the tuner.  You have very little wiggle room to get you from static to clear sound.  It's especially tricky for an elderly person, but it can be done.  A person may actually believe that their set doesn't work because they can't find their way past the static.  Once you do, they work wonderfully.  There's no hissing like some others have mentioned here.  I believe that the hissing that people are encountering is due to some other reason rather than the set itself.  I think it's either interference or their connection isn't giving them the best signal.  There are some remedies for both of those problems.  I suggest that if you own a Samsung tv, you may want to make sure that you have audio out ports.  I've read that some don't have them.  I may buy a second set of these for a television in another room.  It appears that you can't buy just the transmitter. I highly recommend these for people who are hard of hearing.  These put an end to the annoying tv blasting in the room with your hard-of-hearing parent. Love them!"
R3PTDRIYTTN1IO,5,"Got these headphones about 2 wks. ago, took about 15 minutes to set up, let them charge as per instructions for 24 hours and have been very happy with them.  Everything needed to connect to TV was included with detailed instructions in quick start guide .  I hooked mine into audio out on TV, went to menu and set sound adjustment to fixed, like this u can mute the TV and use volume on headphones to control loudness of headphones, plus if someone else is watching TV with u, they can hear TV and adjust volume while u r using headphones.  It tells u if u have static, how to adjust that out, I have no static or hiss with mine as others have complained they do.  I ordered a extra set of earpads (from Amazon, of course) just in case something should happen to them, last headphones I had the earpads came to pieces and could not get replacements for them.  They are very simple to chance,just remove old ones and put new ones on.  All in all am very satisfied with the headphones, first ones I have had on-ear. so u do hear some outside noise, can hear phone ring or if someone says something to u, unlike the noise-cancelling ones that fit over ur ears.  I also like the 2 year warranty with them,hopefully they will last much longer, but who knows, we shall see.  These seemed high to me, but everything is expensive, I guess u get what u pay for."
R350RRSHTOP9A3,5,Love these very good sound and my wife appreciates the silence it provides her!!!!! Recommend to everyone who like music.
R1ZNFHZ5YN9T1R,1,Cheap is not always good. Bad hissing sound that could not be tuned correctly. Think about a better set before you buy.
RIQA9Q3LU937C,4,Hard of hearing. This product delivers  clear sound while blocking out background noise. I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem hearing the tv for any reason.
RODU3HF8QUAEZ,4,Product arrived on time and works very well in all applications. Great range. I did find however that  the headband  will stretch a bit with use. The padded ear cushions also hold the heat from your ears which can be a little irritating if using for 1+ hours. However for the price and quality I would recommend this product.
R16T0ETB0TYAFH,2,The are uncomfortable to wear.  They press flat against your ear instead of cupping you ear.  The will fall off if you bend over to pick something up.  The sound quality is so so and I found myself frequently adjusting the tuning to get rid of the hiss. Going to buy something else.
R3AQQXNQF1L9OL,5,"Bought it for my wife as a Christmas present. We are both retired. Now, she can continue to watch TV at night when I am trying to go to sleep."
R2O3MW9KQQYM09,5,It works great.  Now I can hear the TV without blasting the volume and bothering anyone else in the room.
R307BCU1T46NYV,5,It works very well for our family. As my husband likes the tv very loud we can listen at a normal tone.
R22KPSQCO17Q62,4,"I was very excited to use these and set up was no problem, however the seller shipped them with exhausted batteries that would no take a charge and not instructions on how to access the batteries to change them. I nearly broke them trying to get at the batteries. Finally I did a Google search  &#34;Replacing batterise on Sennheiser RS120&#34; and found the &#34;secret&#34;. Got some new batteries for $10.., let them charge overnight and the phones are working great.<br />For watching TV without disturbing others they work fine. Sound quality is just OK. I can walk around without any issues and still hear the program material."
R3FG2KPAEHARFF,5,"I am so grateful for this item.  I have trouble hearing the television sound, especially movies, the sound is kind of muddled or muffled to me.  I also bought a sound bar which made some programs clearer to hear but still found it hard to hear movies and other shows unless I was sitting on top of the TV sound bar.  I had TV ears but got fed up with how often the stupid ear plugs would fall off and the replacements were quite expensive.  Finally glued them on and they lasted until the ears finally wore out and started not to hold a charge for very long.  That's when I bought the sound bar.  Since I still couldn't hear perfectly I did some Amazon research and bought these headphones.  Performed beyond expectations.  The sounds are crystal clear, setup is easy and it's attractive enough that I don't mind it sitting next to the TV.  I was watching a show the other night and in the show a phone rang in the background and it was so clear I thought it was the phone in my house.  The background noises in the movies on TV sound like they're in my house.  Next year is probably a hearing aid but I won't need to put my hearing aid in when I'm watching TV.  I'll just reach for my Sennheiser headphones."
R1IWQKK1DSKXDF,5,"Hard to beat for top-notch stereo sound when yo don't want noise from the TV to awaken or distract others. Simple to install, easy to maintain and just what the doctor ordered. Completely wireless."
R3N2P565LEGYWU,5,Received this item the day after I ordered. Connected them & began to enjoy hearing the sound right away. I have always had to play my TV sound around 20 & now can hear everything on 8. I am really enjoying them. Thanks Sennheiser.
R19TESB2WON5IG,3,"I have had these phones for about 3 years now, and they are pretty good, but there are annoying traits to them.  When sitting in my normal TV watching position, only 15 feet from the transmitter, I get hiss and dead spots.  When I move my head, sound pops in and out, hiss increases, and it's generally just that..  annoying. When they're  fully charged, it does a bit better, but even then the sound is only average.  The charging cradle is convenient and looks good.  The headband is a bit creaky and underbuilt.  For the price, they are workable, but my next set will definitely be digital.  Analog is just too hissy.  You also have to fiddle with the tuning knob on this set to get good sound. Would not recommend."
R2PEN7GWMI80A1,4,"Used by my husband to listen to TV. Sound is excellent, but could be a bit more comfortable. They don't always stay put on his head the way he would like. Otherwise, great"
R364WK58DDRKT7,3,These headphones work fine so far. They were a christmas gift for my wife. She has not had any signal interference and the sound is very good.<br />Only 3 stars because they are not as comfortable to wear as she would like and I agree. The head band is kind of flat because of the design to fit the charging stand.
R2ZO9JY2VSIYB4,5,We use these for watching and listening on our TV. They are great for clarity (i don't miss whats being said) and the range is great. We have used then 10-14 hours without putting them on the charger they never have went dead. We are really pleased with the quality.
R2E058VDMD8W4H,5,Purchased for an elderly gentleman and he says they are comfortable and very easy to use.  The charging cradle makes them convenient.
R7UTSQ467CHPR,5,We have not tested the range but these headphones do the job in the living room. Came with adapters for the usual single plug stereo to adapt to RCA. No complaints at all!
R1QWQBVI7I1VP,5,"I wanted something so that I could watch TV without disturbing the rest of the house and these really do the trick. They are lightweight, comfortable and the sound is great."
R1YZGP48AYSPG4,5,"These headphones have made a lot of peace in our home. My husband's hearing is getting worse, so he turned the TV up louder and louder, to the chagrin of everyone else in the room. Now, he can listen and hear his shows clearly and the rest of us can read or use our computers, or play our own music on headphones without the constant interference of the TV. Before I had to have my own headphone volume uncomfortably loud just to hear it over the TV."
R1XGJRLGXUTS3Q,5,"This works great for my situation.  Busy time of year when I need to get to bed earlier than my wife.  She gets the headphones, I get eye shades.  Problem solved."
R1ZD7UC26WILE4,5,These headphones were bought for my mother who has a noisy upstairs neighbor.  She tells me they fit comfortably and the sound is crystal clear.  The range is very good and she's able to move around her 1K sq. ft. apt without any interference/loss of sound.
R1EYMYJ03OINSB,5,Work very well for my husband when has nerve deafness.  Helps him hear the TV and me keep my sanity!  True marriage saver!
RZ6HRTK9QC31S,5,The wife loves these!!!!!  She is 60% deaf in one ear and 40% in the other.  Has trouble hearing many frequencies.  She can hear voices much better now!
R3H721NYWY1B88,5,This has been one of my best purchases I've made on Amazon. I live in an apartment with people above me and I put these head sets at night with full high sound and hear awesome sound especially an action movie with awesome bass without sacrificing disturbance to people around me or neighbors and quality of sound.
R2TBYT07I4MDMQ,4,"Price was right, great product, comfortable and having the charging cradle is really great. I reccomend this product to anyone, the sound is amazing."
R2CA0UY8TG1C20,5,Bought these for a relative with a hearing deficit so she would not have to keep her TV volume up so high. Easy setup. Works quite well.
R1LR6OG4QLOYSZ,5,I use these headphones so my wife can sleep while I stay up watching T.V.  So far I get a seven day use period @ 3 hours a night.<br />Would recommend these to my friends.
R3DMZ2PN1AILS7,5,"I love the headphones, will buy another pair for gift!<br />recharges easily on stand, good distance on the remote reception"
R3SMB452XE8F7P,4,"These headphones were comfortable and work great for listening to TV when plugged into a reciever.  Unfortunately, the outputs from a laptop seem to be too &#34;low&#34; for I to work as well.  Definitely read the various write-up on these headphones.  I think generally you will see that those using it for TV are quite pleased, while other &#34;weaker-output&#34; device reviews are more mixed.<br /><br />I was truthfully hoping to use it for both, thus I had to knock off a star."
R3BS6584CS9E8X,2,"I was so excited for these, but I would not recommend them.  I'll be selling mine and getting a better pair.<br /><br />If an audio signal is not sent to them for 30 seconds (like pressing mute, or coming to the end of a DVD), there is a LOUD!!!! hissing sound that literally hurts your ears.<br /><br />That's annoying, but manageable.<br /><br />THE REAL ISSUE: Every 30-60 seconds (I'm not exaggerating.) there is a LOUD!!! hiss that lasts for just a half a second, but it's DAMN LOUD and super annoying.<br /><br />There is NOTHING I can do about it.  I'm about 8 feet from the base, but I stood right next to it with no change in frequency or volume.  Speaking of volume, the brief but constantly occurring hiss is much much louder than the audio you were listening to.<br /><br />BUY A HIGHER END MODEL. IT IS WORTH $30-40 TO NOT HAVE THE CONSTANT HISSING."
R2WR22O4748LSX,4,"Arrived well packaged, on time, and in good order. It was easy to install, and I have used it for years, and like the convenience and sound. They are reasonably comfortable. I sometimes have a problem getting the charging light to come on right away, but that's about the only downside."
R5YZYZ70SG6AW,1,"Well, I bought a set about 15 years ago for 40.00 at Costco......Seeing what I see now, I probably should have bought about ten pair. The Pair I bought back then was Model # TR130. They fully encompassed the ear and were so absolutely comfortable.  These have ALMOST the usual GREAT sound like Sennheiser's should; however, the biggest weak point is, they DO NOT fully encompass the ear!  They simply rest on the surface of the ear; thus, you hear all the interruptions and existing background noise that may be going on around you. I know, I know, it's probably for my own safety.....big brother and all.....OR maybe the company got sued by someone because their house was broken into and they didn't hear the burglar breaking in because  the headset was so sound sealed from outside sounds.....hahaha....you laugh, but if you're from good ol' sunny California, a company can just about get sued for anything. These headphones plain downright \\""hurt\\"" your head they squeeze so tight.  I have tried everything to loosen them up. There are NO adjustments at all for tightness.......just the standard ones to fit them properly over the ears.  They are being returned tonight, since it's my last day to return them!!!  :("
R28YRBEODHDVHN,1,Bought this product twice and both times stopped working after 1 year.  First time the headphones went out.  Second time the base unit would not charge.  Would not buy again.
RTNOW6TMTD6GK,4,"I use these headphones to watch Neflix while I am doing my daily 5 mile exercise on the stationery bike. I use them everyday and would not be with out them. I am completely deaf in my right ear and only about 30% hearing in the left, but with these head phones and Netflix's closed captioning I do quite well and am very happy with the arrangement. I have been using them for over 4 years."
R3W48H06EQEVMZ,5,I got this for my hubby for Christmas. It works find once I figured out that you could just connected to your Dish box and not the TV.<br />It doesn't tell you in the setup that you can do this. I went on line and search setups for this item and after three weeks I found a site that gave you this information. Very happy with it now.
R3E94NRKSHHOUD,5,We were finding us continually raising the TV volume and still not understanding what they were saying so we ordered 1 pr. of the RS120's. After a few minutes we were convinced that we needed another pair. Now my wife and I enjoy a whole new dimension of watching shows. Sounds and dialog are clear and understandable. We even have the TV on mute.<br />They are comfortable and seem well made and a great value.<br />We hooked the first set up using &#34;Y&#34; RCA jacks into the TV as we already had the audio output going into the stereo amplifier. We did not need to hook the second set to the TV. We just plugged the charger unit into AC power and set both units on the same channel and they both work terrifically.
RLWTO4A5G09BW,5,Bought these for my partially deaf wife. She puts these on and I don't have to listen to her boring programs while I am two rooms away.
R1WKQFLRB2H1WC,4,"Bought these so TV could be watched and other family members could sleep. The power connection is a tight and difficult to reach fit into the charging base and seems to have a poor connection. This causes the reception to cut in and out at times, even with the charging base mounted on the wall."
R33XUQOSX6TC7U,1,"The headphone worked intermittently. Sennheiser replaced unit promptly, that was good!<br />The replacement unit's headphones stopped working after 2 hour and being switched off once."
R27XUYH4YJQ3HL,4,"I always liked these so I opted to replace with the same.  The new price on Amazon was not much higher than buying used.  I read the Sennheiser top model provides incredible surround sound.  However, costs more two or so times as much.  These have much better sound than the TV and I can listen without bothering anyone."
R1PZPS1QYI522Y,5,This Wireless headphones are georgeous!!! You can listen music or your TV audio through walls. Thats real!! I recommend you to buy a spare part of the Earpads. I think they will last a lot but in the future I am not very sure you can get them.
R1WCB1TY04K0HT,5,"I tried other headphones, this works great.  It is more comfortable to wear, the contacts for charging the unit are surrounded by cushions."
R44GAFCCD28CA,4,We had 2 versions of TV Ears over the years as my husband's hearing is not what it used to be.  The problem with the TV Ears headset was that the foam that was to be near your ear would fall off and later my husband resorted to just wrapping the ends in soft Kleenex.<br /><br />We have found the only way these Wireless RF Headphones work for my husband to hear the TV is for them to be dialed at a high noise level.  The problem with that is I can hear the TV when I go to bed. (With TV Ears I did not hear the TV) My husband must then turn the Wireless Headphones down and then he cannot hear the TV. They are made well and are comfortable but I can only give them a 4 at the highest due to this problem.
R1Z2N65HT15U97,3,"These headphones work fine and the quality of sound is good.  However, I can't use them for any length of time, because they hurt my ears.  I have tried them in all positions, but the pressure is in the wrong places on my earlobes and gets very painful.  There is no way to adjust for width, only length on the head."
R7S2THXYVX4G5,2,"I have a normal size head and needed to replace SONY &#34;Over the ear&#34; MDR 970s - no longer available.<br />I am disappointed about these Sennheiser 120 headphones and am considering returning them.<br /><br />They headphones are particularly susceptible to falling off and crashing on the floor unless I remain totally stationary.<br />I'm talking about just getting up from my chair and walking around the room, nothing particularly athletic.<br /><br />These are ON the ear headphones, not OVER the ear so you can't depend upon your ears to help hold them in place.<br /><br />Sound quality and range are acceptable but I had to devise a Velcro strap headband to wear with the<br />phones to hold them in place."
R3BY0L4CC5570J,3,"Not a bad product, but it's heavy and your ears will become warm and sweaty after a few minutes of use."
R1SL9DVKWFNA5R,5,"My wife loves them and so do I. She stays up late at night watching TV and the surround sound would keep me up as I get up early. She pops these on and turns down the volume on the surround sound and everyone is at peace. I worried in the past when she used to use a wired connection to the surround sound directly to some headphones and thunder and lightning was in the area. With these wireless phones, she is safe watching during severe storms."
R3LFT4DQWZAGSS,5,"I'm hard of hearing and have to turn the TV up loud to hear it, I've bought wireless headphones before and they all were crap, these are fantasic, I can walk around the whole house with no problems with the sound fading or any static. my only complaint is after a while they start to hurt my ears, why I'm not sure , cause there not heavy .  Anyway I still love them and so do the other people around me when I wear them."
R33W2NDOKEMOV4,2,I ordered the Sennheiser RS120 when I thought my Sennheiser wireless headphones had stopped working.<br />The Rs120 turned out to be much inferior to my old headphones(which were RS130).  Lots of static and generally poor reception and somewhat uncomfortable feeling on the ears.  I returned the R S120 and ordered an RS130<br />which I now have .  The RS130 is completely satisfacory.  .
RHORH6EDAJYKV,5,These are great earphones. Good quality hearing. These are a perfect gift for that someone who likes to hear movies loud
R2WEBDIUC0R7PK,5,I bought the wireless headphones so I could watch TV without disturbing my wife who was otherwise occupied.  I put the TV on mute so there is no sound coming from there and now I can watch TV whenever it is convenient.
R1YQEIZFZ20ZM3,5,"I bought these as a gift for my mother-in-law who is very hard of hearing (she wears two hearing aids but still has a hard time hearing the television without turning it up very loudly).  We wanted to replace a set we got at Radio Shack several years ago that were finally wearing out, but I have to say, even though we were more than satisfied with her first pair, these are FAR SUPERIOR to that first set.<br /><br />They were extremely easy to install and set up (I was done in less than five minutes), and my mother-in-law loves them.  She says the sound is very clear, even without her hearing aids,  and the head set is much more comfortable than her last set was.  She can even walk around our 2500+ sq. ft. house and still hear her programs.<br /><br />This is a great product at a very reasonable price, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a hard time hearing the TV."
R7KXI80KTL3GW,5,"Got these for my wife to be able to watch TV when we go to bed and I want to sleep, without sound.  Work as advertised; charge up during the day and they last for hours.  Easy to hook up to cable box, and when you mute the TV, does not cause headphones to get softer, as there is a volume control on headphones. Good quality product."
R3UJ9HMMPXFLZE,3,"I got these to listen to my movies while the kiddos are sleeping, but unfortunately they don't work well for that. The way they handle input volume is bizarre: the headphones automatically adjust volume to ensure the sound isn't too loud or too quiet.<br /><br />I watched The Dark Knight Rises, which is a typical action movie sound-wise, and the headphones were constantly changing volume on me, to the point where I missed half the dialog. In short, when an explosion or other loud noise happens, the headphones go really quiet, making any dialog afterwards inaudible. Turning up the headphones doesn't really work, because the volume slowly goes back up to normal, making the next explosion ear-shattering for the moment it takes the headphones to go quiet again.<br /><br />I use these now for playing video games - the effect is still there but it isn't as disruptive in most games. With the base only a few feet away from my head, there's no hiss that I notice."
RBZ5M9HGZRB23,4,Had a little trouble getting it to work at first. But once I able to tune in it worked great
R1TVWTY73PE0VP,2,I got this to work at first and liked that I could hear the TV all the way to the back bathroom in my house.  However there was occasional static and I had to frequently tune it back in.  The worst that happened was it started completely loosing the audio from the TV and when that happened I got loud static which was not good for my ears.  I did send it back and received a full refund from Amazon. They even paid for shipping.
RANDLUWIE2HIM,4,Sound is very good & is comfortable but volume & tune controls not smoothe.  Needs mute button.  Otherwise a good value.
R2F1VZQH6TWRI6,1,"So I got these for christmas and just now getting around to needing them. They worked for about 3 minutes, with static, even on all channels and different tune. Then the main stand/transmitter went out. So honestly, I'd say move on to the next brand. I've dealt with Sennheiser twice now and they have never blew me away."
R31UXL599I7XOL,4,"It took a while to tune these in, I did not understand the instructions all that well but that is just me. They work fine after i got them figured out. Woule recommend these to anyone looking for a set of woreless headphones. The sound is great, a little background hiss is noticeable ??? Don't know what that is all about, but not troubling to use these. The ear pieces are padded well, adjustablility is adequate. Can't compare to others because this is the first time I ever tried anything like this."
R3DWZUA9CH22Y2,5,I love these headphones. My house walls have thin walls and it's great when I'm listening to music or watching a movie.
R2JA9BHXSK0QGV,2,"This is my second review, the first one was during our honeymoon, now we no longer have a relationship, it was very good while it lasted, but it lasted only about 9 months. I have been without it for about 3 months now, and I miss them, but just check online and found out that they they do have a 2 years warranty. I really like these headphones, the sound was excellent and I could walk from bedroom in the back of the house to the kitchen in front of the house and not miss anything, the sound was perfect. I am an owl, stayed up very late every night and bought them so my companion (dog Natasha) could sleep while I watched my programs. Not anymore. The sound is gone and the batteries are charged.. I will keep up to date with the warranty issue.."
R2MUEMDBDESZ48,5,Hooking them up is easy. You leave the headset on the wires for 24 hours to charge the batteries in the earmuff. You get the tuning dial adjusted and the volume dial and you can walk around the room or into the next room and still hear your TV or stereo. Sound is clear and the headset is comfortable. Hard to know what to complain about....
R17Z9ZH5I1FKJL,5,"These are wonderful.  You can clean house, wash dishes, take care of bathroom needs, all while still listening to your fave program.  No wires, re-energized just by placing back on the wire stand overnight, comfortable to wear and especially beneficial to anyone with a hearing problem.  I only wish there was a way for me to listen on my earphones while a visitor can still access sound from the television speakers.  Not a huge problem for me as I live alone, but would be nice to have a switch where both would offer sound if I had a guest."
RVZ334UL3K6NU,4,"I thought maybe 5 stars was too much as i kind of just bought these without checking around<br />I  took one star off because the phones fit lightly enough so that i have to get used to them slipping off my head when i bend down a bit.  You train yourself to be prepared for that.  The first time you do that it is a trauma.  So one star off for a heads up.  Besides i don't really believe in 5 starring everything that comes around.  4 stars rocks in my rating system<br /><br />A while back i had read all the customer reviews for the Sens all the way up to $300 phones and then burnt out on the whole thing as I just didn't know how much money to spend for what i wanted.<br /><br />(problem is stores don't supply demo models anymore  its all online  and i really cringe to think i may have to order and send a few sets back just to audition them.  stupid waste.  So i gambled with the Sens and I won big time)<br /><br />Some time later I bit the bullet and got the lower priced model  I did not shop much  I figured the Sens would do the job.<br /><br />they did  these replace my 12 year old falling apart JVCs for double the price  same quirk in that when the signal you are listening to stops (as in say, a single youtube music clip) after a while if there is no signal you get a loud hiss.  if you are listening at a safe proper level it isn't overpowering.  the jvcs didn't come CLOSE to these at double the price (for the 12 year old price of the js)<br /><br />I find the controls to be superior to what i have had before, and after a bit of orientation i have NO trouble switching the unit off with my left thumb when i know the signal stopped.  I am also having a minimum of trouble on the right hand distinguishing between the volume wheel and the tuning wheel (which doesn't need adjustment once its set for my proximity)  I think i will tape over that.  but the operation experience is SMOOTH.<br /><br />the unit is very comfortable although not completely transparent, the flaw being as above with the slipping. but the sound.  I have very old burnt ears and the clarity of these phones enables me to enjoy a good balance of the dynamics of the program signal without having to crank too high up (as i had to do with my old phones) and that causes problems with my nerve damage in my ears.<br /><br />They sound great and i am not going to knock myself out trying to find a comparison - certainly a $300 or so  pair is going to be too much diminishing returns so i wouldn't bother. They can't sound THAT much better for triple the price.  At least not for my old ears.<br /><br />Best purchase i have made of this type in many a year. Excellent overall.  I really don't like giving 5 stars for items like this,  I took one off mainly for the slippage, which as i said, one familiarizes and then they are trained to be aware and take precautions.<br /><br />Solid, well enough build for the weight and price, and the recharge feature where you hang up on the base works well with a minimum of fiddling.  (although i did get a pack of AAA Eneloops to have just in case i forget to hang them up.)<br /><br />Highly recommended product, the idiosyncrasies and shortcomings are minimal and can be lived with nicely  I don't think there  is a headphone anywhere that isn't going to provide a few nits.<br /><br />Smooth Product, Big delivery  -  Sennheisers ROCK!!"
R3D2XUA06DS032,4,so far i find everything fine except the volume and tuner controls are on the same side and very close to each other so i find i am messing with the tuner control when wanting to adjust volume. this is a pain but when i'm use to this it will happen less. that's why the 4 stars instead of 5. for the rest i'm completely satisfied.
R2J1ZOUVZ1IVUC,3,"The headphones are good, but weak ! You know ?<br /><br />But they are working fine and I do not have much to complain.<br /><br />Thank you."
R2Z9P3WFRH9CIO,4,"Got these for my Mom who doesn't hear well and uses captions on the TV and basically gave up watching movies.  They work great for her purpose and she has shared them with her friends who were impressed as well.  The range is much better than I would have expected, essentially working in the entire house.  They are a bit big for her small head and will slide off if she looks down or up too much or to quickly.  A trade off for having the large comfortable ear pieces I suppose.  Overall I would certainly recommend for this type of use."
R176SN5I6WKK2,5,"She loves them, and has them on whenever we go to visit her at her house. Personally, I have never tried them."
R3NM1PQFF9Z37V,5,"I purchased these headphones for my Dad who has difficulty hearing the TV. They work fantastically, but we had to buy a few extras to get them to work. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR TV FOR AUDIO OUT plug ins. We didn't do that (and I imagine there are other reviews that say as much, but I didn't read through them thoroughly), so we figured out that we needed to use the Digital/Optical output plug instead (his Vizio has an SPDIF plug). I purchased the Analog to Digital/Optical converter and a Digital/Optical cord from Amazon, and then we had it working perfectly."
R1Y4H971IYY9CI,3,"These are just okay. We're a bit disappointed for the price. First of all, it's kind of hard to tune to what you're trying to watch - slight movements result in that in-between-stations sound, so I haven't tried moving between rooms. Second, they're very lightweight so they feel kind of cheap. Third, the sound leaks out so whoever is next to you can still hear whatever you're watching, which defeats the purpose if the idea is to let your spouse go to bed."
R10VX4AU06SV1B,4,I use these headphones all the time. The sound quality is excellent. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars..... intermittent static.
R32WLGKC7MSVA6,5,"I purchased the Sennheisers as a gift for a friend. Having recently purchased the JBL WR-4's, I was anxious to<br />check out the Sennheisers before passing on the gift. I was surprised that your product does not have the<br />noticable &#34;hiss&#34; that most of your headphone reviews reported...I liked the size, comfort and response. Now<br />that I have seen, felt and heard for myself, I will wait to catch a lower Amazon price for your RS120-with the Charger and order a set for myself. ...especially now that my WR-4's have stopped working! I have not heard back from manufactor, but hopefully I can have them replaced or repaired. They are nice, wireless<br />(WR-4) headphones with terrific response but are a bit clumbsey to handle. And as with many wireless headphone reviews I've read on Amazon, the foam earpieces fall off too easily and  the charging cradles are a little difficult . My accolades for the design of the Sennheiser cradle.<br />Obviously some owners of passed purchases might disagree but this is my story and I am sticking to it! Chuk"
RN900SI6H0K8P,1,"Constant loud hissing sound. Does not synch / tune with the home unit well, have to do it each Ike I wear it, stopped using it. Bad purchase."
R201ZVPXQH4DOF,5,"we bought one headset for hubby who has some loss of hearing.  The headset has made TV watching extremely pleasant again. I was very happy for him, then I put them on while watching a movie and WOW!  I found out what I had been missing, the underlying melodies, the faint background voices and much more.  We have a 70&#34; TV and were happy with the sound, until we got the headphones!!  This product is so great that we bought a set for me...and I have great hearing!  Now we are starting to watch all our DVD's again to hear what we have been missing.  One other important point, we had bought a set of TV Ears from Costco for $100 and found that to hear one had to sit directly in line with the base....and couldn't walk away.  Our tech grandson did the research and suggested these....we are beyond happy!!  With this set we can walk all through the house (3,700 sq ft) and not miss a word.  We recommended them to others and they have purchased them, and love them too!"
R1WIQ92YME6QUW,5,On a set of Panasonic headphones didn't work as well and the soft from around the ear pieces was very uncomfortable.RS 120 is very comfortable and the sound is excellent
RBMIWPQK8WSPT,4,"I have several sets of wireless headphones connected to various TVs, set-top boxes, Rokus, etc. throughout my house and these Sennheiser headphones are far and away the highest quality. The sound quality is excellent -- whether watching live TV/DVR recorded TV, surround sound-heavy movies or my digital music library. In addition, they are extremely comfortable (far more so than my Sony wireless headphones that have simply not lasted) and they provide plenty of listening time one a charge. In fact, I've never had an occasion where the charge ran out while I was still listening to them.<br /><br />I really only have two complaints:<br /><br />1) On occasion, I have gotten some static from the headphones. They are multi-channel and changing channels (via the on headphone button) is easy and usually remedies the situation, however, not always. I guess this is a weakness of any wireless device, especially in a modern household where the number of devices that emit EMF signals is increasing exponentially. Shifting the location of the Charging Cradle (literally moving or twisting askew just a few inches) has always fixed this problem when adjusting the broadcast channel did not but who wants to get up and down when using wireless devices?<br /><br />2) The cord that connects the Charging Cradle to your audio source is a tad limited in length especially if, like me, you need to snake it through an audio system and behind audio/video furniture. Additionally, the only connection method is via a small traditional headphone jack. In comparison, my Sony headphones (poorer sound and reception quality though) do allow connecting via other means (headphone jack, audio out jack) which makes using longer cords a bit easier.<br /><br />Having noted these &#34;complaints&#34; it's important to know that with these included I am in the process of replacing my existing Sony wireless headphones with another pair of these Sennheiser's which is ultimately the only real review you need to know.ow."
R1XQK4ODSLXW8L,2,"These have excellent sound, but must be balanced on the head or they fall off.  Beyond annoying in use.<br />Originally, I loved these for the value with great sound for radio, TV and CD.  Except for static during silence, the sound is terrific everywhere.<br />After living with them for awhile, however, I am  beyond annoyed with the way they fall off with the slightest movement.  To look down from a screen is to have them in my lap.<br />Over time I am adjusting to their instability, but it is a lot like a back injury.  I avoid that which causes the pain instinctively:  No quick movement - put my hands on the phones if I move my head off vertical -  reposition or take them off until I can balance again.  A lapse and I catch them as they fall off.<br />I am going to have to replace them.  I thought these were a great value, but I feel I must advise spending more money on whatever is the next level that will stay on the head."
RXERLL54R3QNJ,2,"This was the most expensive Christmas gift on my list, and my brother in law couldn't get it to work after the first time using it.  I'm noticing a trend with Amazon electronic sales in the high dollar range, and it's not a good one.  Apparently if you spend more than $50 on anything shipped directly by Amazon, you're almost wasting your money.  I wish I'd bought this at Walmart instead.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed."
RIL989MNNOHS5,4,Worked out of the box.  Is comfortable and loud enough.  Is not as flimsey as others I have had From other companies
RJDEQY4NYELFC,5,This is the second set I've purchased as a gift. My husband loves to watch sports/movies at extreme volumes that are way to loud for me or the kids. This product is great because now my husband can watch anything and it won't bother any of us. It's also wireless so he can multitask too! Great clear sound. I highly recommend it!
R2QGAIR6YCHGMD,4,"For the price, the RS120 would be hard to equal.  The overall response is not up to that of the RS180, but the value for the cost is incredible.  The sound is fuller than that of similarly priced corded headphones I used in the past.  It did take a half-day to tune out interference; just be sure to carefully try full rotation of the headphone tuning wheel for each of the three click positions on the transmitter.  I connected directly to an audio-out on an A/V receiver for stable volume.  While not KLEER, the output is perfectly clear with no dropouts anywhere in our house.  Practically speaking, the charging system works perfectly, the open-back speakers and flattish cushions keep my ears from sweating, I am no longer afraid of stepping on cords, which, at my age, could be disastrous, and a two-year warranty.  Everything adds up to a great value."
R4SBEUFQNA8ZB,5,I ordered two sets of headphones for the single transmitter so both my wife and I could hear the TV and they work perfectly! We can walk into another room if we want to and still hear as if we were sitting in front of the set.
ROX9869JXMMX7,1,"Planning way ahead for once, I purchased this item in May as a Christmas present. When my wife opened the box at Christmas, there was no power cord to connect the changing cradle to the wall. We can't use the headphones. And, as the return time has passed, we can't exchange it for one with all the component parts. I'm disappointed."
R33HY8XRJDFQWO,5,"My husband loves to watch the TV in the evening, while I read. It somewhat drove me crazy so after seeing the gentlemen across the street always check his mail or receive the trash receptacle with his trusty headphones on, I knew the most excellent gift for my TV hound...the magic headphones.  Now, he can watch TV and I can read without any distractions.  Only drawback, my husband is feeling extremely old as the elderly gentlemen is safely in his late 80s.:/"
R1X8HHVOXOXY47,5,This is what I had hoped for. Very clear and able to adjust volume independantly of the TV. I am hard of hearing and these magnify and clear the sound. I highly recomend these to anyone that is hard of hearing.
RP8EPLSOYJSYX,1,I bought these for my mother for Christmas thinking I was buying her the top of the line.  First pair worked for 5 minutes then quit so I sent those back for a replacement.  Replacement pair did the same thing.  Followed the instructions for charging the appropriate amount of time but just wouldn't ever work more than five minutes.
R2OQY57WGT9JPI,4,"The sound is great.  My only complaint would be that the headpiece falls off of my thin head when I look down or get up out of my chair.  They do not grip tightly enough for a small head.  The ear pieces are flat and not sized around the ears so there is no grip at all.  Other than that, when I am still, the sound is great and I never miss a word."
RHT16SPEWDEP4,5,"These have made it possible for my husband and I to watch tv together again.  He turns the headphones up as loud as he needs and I control the volume from the tv speakers. When I go to bed, he can mute the speakers so the sound doesn't disturb me.  They are comfortable and have good battery life.  When the battery life dropped (after at least three years of steady use) we simply replaced the batteries.  We have three sets of these and take one of them when we travel. That way my husband can listen to tv in a hotel room without bothering other room. Or me!"
RE285K0MBIGWP,1,"This headset is difficult to tune to the transmitter and even when you get it tuned, after a while, it loses reception to the point where the person I bought it for simply won't use it. I need to return it."
R2298Q5T9MT4BJ,5,I rated this based on previous version of this at our former home on Georgia.  I am not so sure about this new one.  Installation was easy but I have been unable to tune in the volume on any of the three channels on this item.  If any one can help I'd appreciate your help; otherwise I'll have to call the T V repair man.
RZ165GU0BN41L,1,"Purchased in order to watch TV/movies while the kids are sleep.<br />Pros:<br />- Price<br />- Range is pretty good.  I can walk almost anywhere on the 1st floor of of my house and the sound is solid<br />- The charger works well<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fit is awkward and does not block out any ambient sound as the headphones rest on top of your ears<br />-  The Auto Shutoff makes this product unusable.  They seem to shutoff regardless if the audio is present or not.  I have the base station connected to my Samsung SmartTV audio out jack.  The sound clearly plays for about 3-4 minutes then the base station auto shuts off, even if the audio is still playing.  In order to restart the base station i must touch the metal charging stand and then the green power on light will illuminate and base station power on again for another 3-4 minutes.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
R2O2GC5UQ31ZY1,1,Very difficult to use and directions are not clear.  Charged and just couldn't get the headphones to work.  Returned for a refund.
R3A2Q8Q3WMVOMI,4,"I bought these to replace a pair of Sony headphones that seem to encounter static around the wireless router. The portion that covers the ear is flat while the Sony cupped the ear, the Sennheiser sits upon it. But it works exceptionally well with all of the RF in the house, and sound quality is excellent for this price point."
RSAOCMLBURPRN,5,"Bought these for mom, while visiting, as she would not say when she could not hear. Now she has control. These are so much better than the TV ears bought a few years ago. Batteries are replaceable with standard sizes (not so with TV ears). Installation was a simple, no interference that we read about in other reviews. Headphones are comfortable to wear."
RWWQ419RDSPM8,1,"Bought these for my father and he loves them. He even wears them in the yard to listen to music from his TV while raking so it is a win win for both of us.  updated: These have stopped working altogether. They stopped working around 9/14. Can't return them now, but way too expensive to only get about 9 months use. Tried to return them but was told after 30 days you can't return them anymore, so buyer beware, this is a lot of money for only a 30 day warranty. Very disappointed, my elderly father really enjoyed them while they worked. I think on products like this it might be better to order from them directly, you might get a better return policy than Amazon offers."
RP67CJ03JJPWK,5,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! She always watches the programs with the British accents, like Downton Abby and could never quite make out everything they were saying. Now she catches all of what they say, plus, she can even walk around the house and not miss a word!  I installed it directly into the cable box, so she can mute the TV sound, yet hear any volume she wishes inside the headphones. Highly recommend this product."
R23GBX5CT5HD60,3,"I was given these as a present. When i first tried them I hated them. They hissed, and didn't seem to have much range. After letting them sit for a few months, i thought I might as well use them. The hiss was gone, and they had a nice sound to them. They are really nice to watch movies with, you don't realize how much sound the new flat screens don't have. You hear more of the sounds you hear when you are at the movies. My biggest problem now is they cut out for a few seconds. Sometimes just now and then, other times a lot. Very annoying when you are watching a action pack movie. If it wasn't for the cut out and lack of range as advertised, I would give these a higher rating, and also buy another pair for the wife."
R2IN7Z9T0FJDQ6,5,"I had no experience with wireless headphones prior to these Sennheisers, but my hearing just &#34;ain't what it used to be&#34; so after reviewing all the models in my price range, I decided to spring for this model. I must say that I couldn't be happier with my choice. I hooked them up to my TV audio out jack right out of the box and they performed even beyond my expectations. I haven't tried a real &#34;range check&#34; as all my TV watching is confined to the room my sound system is installed in. but there was no degradation to the sound quality when I walked to the next room (about 30 feet). If I wanted to be super critical, there could be a little more bass range than they give, and the headband is comfortable but somewhat heavy and tends to slip down if I move around. I can't say I have a lot of experience with other model headphones, but these meet my needs perfectly and I don't think they can be beat for the money."
R36C5W5WDA0179,4,Every thing we expected. My wife is losing her hearing and these are doing the job. Very happy we chose this. Sennheiser is a good name. You won't be disappointed.
RK9OKMFXF21O6,2,"The receiver base will not maintain the signal for any length of time.  This was for my husband, and very frustrating when he is just getting in to the movie/show and the sound goes out.  Seems to go out about every 5 minutes or sooner.  We have followed the directions off the website, but still not working well.  When the signal is on and the sound comes thru, it is very good.  But just too frustrating when it is on/off, on/off, on/off.<br /><br />Will probably send back."
R3VGIV16A210JY,5,"Works as advertised. Synced exactly with Samsung TV and allows for TV volume to be off, headphones on. Nice work."
RLD4X0GBNIQGX,4,I chose the rating because I thought it should be adjustable volume for the left and right separately.This set does not.  Good sound able to listen to my programs on TV
R2SSQ8HS94FKTD,5,"A Christmas present for my hard of hearing husband. He loves them, except that they slip forward on his head when he leans over to get up from his seat. They could be a tighter fit, but they really really help with the TV volume!"
R269TECW4S77I7,4,"Very good sound quality, easy set up.only wish is a more comfortable ear pad. good quality of components and design."
R12Z39NV7YXUXH,5,"Fits onto our TV perfectly without adapters.  Great sound, easy to use.  My husband can turn volume up without disrupting household."
R1CUNDHZOXFV7Y,4,Helps when family members are watching different programming and have different levels of hearing. My only complaint is it messes up my hair.
R2W9262N0A5667,4,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  They are really nice for watching TV.  We wish they would switch over to do the same for movies.
R2MZKVP82AYNPC,5,I purchased these headphones to better hear television without turning volume up to an annoying level.  They work very well and are easy to charge and use.
R2340YVF5QQ7JO,4,Probably the best of three different systems I have used. Good audio & significantly more comfortable than my other ones. Under certain circumstance they do slide off your head if you get up to move aeound.
R2IUDX5Y2NKCWX,5,Love the headphones!  I can hear the t.v. so much better now.  I can have the volume on the t.v. completely down and then adjust the volume on the headphones.  I can go to another room and still hear the sound clearly on the t.v.  Hope these last a long time!
RVNLJVNSOA862,5,better than I expected. walked to the end of my driveway 130 ft to get mail and could still hear the news on tv
RB7GL695G9QPG,5,i like to watch tv in be this keeps the harmony without soun complaints i trie the sony also from amazon i not like the soun cracklingall the time any way gave a new sony to my son in law he loves that for his football games gave the sennheiser to my son  lets evaluate  cliff
R18HP3Z44HMBC4,4,"It is good but, sometimes have to adjust to get rid of the low pitched noise when walking around. Stiil, I would recommend this one to anybody."
RLEXIFAVLBB2U,5,These are great.. as long as your TV can output to multiple audio devices simultaneously.. &#34;Most do&#34; then you can have audio coming out these while anyone else in the room can listen to the TV speakers like normal.  This is great if you have anyone in the room with hard of hearing.  Give them the headset and they can hear perfectly while the rest of the audience can keep the TV set at a reasonable volume.  The clarity and depth of the sound is impeccable.  I prefer watching TV with these on all the time now. You hear things you never heard before.  Wonderful.  They even charge themselves when you hang them back up on the cradle! added bonus!!
R2075TR4IJK60O,1,"This worked great for about 6 months, then just stopped working.  No idea why.  Nothing had changed in the environment.  No one was playing with it roughly or anything.  Just didn't work one day.  Don't bother getting one."
RLZBAH3OBC48Z,5,"These head phones work great, I am able to go to sleep while my husband continues to watch TV. It was a great gift for he and I"
R5ULKCA0DXVNU,5,These headphone are great!  There is no interference.  I can continue listening to the program even if I leave the room with the TV and go to the other end of the house.
R3V8G3KVYOIQKX,5,This is a quality headphone that really works from a distance. My husband can use them while he is out in the garage!
R55ND0LPQ893Q,2,"These were my first wireless headphones after using corded headphones for years. I realize they are probably considered on the low end for wireless, but I did expect at least decent performance and some ability to enjoy music. The headphones are light and not uncomfortable. The recharger works just fine and the distance range is OK. Other than that, they are a total disappointment. The dynamic range seems very compressed around the vocal frequencies with the higher frequencies the most affected although the bass is also weak. Virtually none of my music sounds good. Only a few things which were already lacking in dynamic range originally sound just OK. Too much range and listening enjoyment is simply lost with these headphones.  I don't like them."
R2PQE07AHWWU6T,5,"My husband has significant hearing loss, and always has the TV volume up so the neighbors can hear our programming!  These were easy to set up, and work great!  I can now have the volume set at a &#34;normal&#34; level, and my husband can have the volume in the headphones set so he can hear.  He has actually noticed background music in programs we have been watching, that he never heard before.  If these came with  a digital connection I would get another set for the TV in our bedroom."
R3VPUMB6J2M5XY,5,I ordered these for my 83 year old Mom and she is thrilled with the quality and the fact that she is not confined to her computer when listening to music and meditations.
R2FXH3LOYF5EVX,5,THESE ARE AWESOME!!!! Easy to hook up and sound is great!!!!  I bought a cheap pair of Sharper Image wireless headphones and they were terrible.  You get what you pay for and you will not be disappointed with these.
R371BTCLHVFAPK,5,"I bought these for my mom because she was having trouble understanding the dialog on her TV.  She's not able to learn how to do new things anymore so I was concerned that they might be too complicated for her but I plugged them in, turned them on, adjusted the volume, and she's been using them successfully ever since."
R4K4CCZQU2LT1,5,"I have a set of headphones for each of my three TV sets.  This is my favorite headphone set, the sound quality is great and i can go into another part of the house and still listen to the TV.  My Sony headphones also have good sound quality but I cannot leave the room and still hear the TV."
R35MM9AZ0Z34TE,2,Headphones didn't keep reception very well. Always cutting out and hard to tune back in for a signal. The charging stand is tricky. Hard to get to set correctley to charger. Too much of a hassel. When it did work (for a short time) they sounded great. Very sad it didn't work out.
R1VOFZ0NCFTSX0,4,Sound is much better than TV's speakers. Good battery life and convenient charging.  I highly recommend these for a couple where one wants to hear the TV all day. Only negative is they don't adjust down enough and fall off too easily if you bend over.
R3CE5V0KFW46Z9,5,"Love these Sennheiser wireless headphones. At age 72 I found my hearing beginning to have trouble picking up some voices from movies on tv. And visiting a friend with the same trouble but who had purchased a pair of these Sennheisers more to help prevent disturbing his wife when watching tv at night, I found they helped overcome my problem. So I bought two pair with one charging cradle just to be sure I wouldn't run out of power in the middle of a movie. What a great buy. Comfortable, occasionally a bit difficult to keep on my head when I bend over to pick up a newspaper or something, but with a range allowing me to roam my house and not miss a play during a football game or a pitch during baseball, I consider this one of my better purchases of recent years. I recommend them enthusiastically."
R13KMYJ70JCAER,1,"I can't comment on how well they worked.  I'm returning them because they sent me USED headphones.  (Obvious by the way it was packaged - twist ties in the box not holding anything.)  When I opened it, there was dead skin cells on the ear portion.  GROSS."
RT89WG6E69MWI,5,I bought this over a year ago and the headphones still hold a charge.  I have never ran out of a charge while using for hours every night. I have forgot to charge for a few days and still worked incredibly.  HIGHLY recommend this product.  Now I can watch movies or sports late at night without disturbing the sleeping family.
R2UPE97N9I62G3,5,"There isn't anything we don't like about this headset but I especially love how simple it us to set it on the charger , no fiddling.  Great sound and so comfortable to wear."
R3425M5QWDHVJU,4,bought these for my son after doing some research. these were the cordless version and he says they were excellent from a distance and very clear sounding compared to the much more expensive brands out there!...he loved his!
R3NRKHS4EBN4X8,4,Very good for my expectations although when I get distant to the source There is uncomfortable distortion  the sound is excellent
RZY31VM01CTKP,5,This was a gift for my husband and he loves it! He was really impressed with the charging station and the clarity of the sound.
R2QJVEEYLHI9OM,5,"I bought these for my husband, and he absolutely LOVES them! The sound is clear and he can use them anywhere in the house."
R1K9GUL7EPOPJV,5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves them! He is able to hear much better with the assistance of headphones.<br />This product arrived very quickly. We are very satisfied with this product!
R2GQACCC615GJ0,4,"Occasional static interference. Hearing neighbors activity through phones. It's like enhanced hearing, so at my age, I'm not complaining. Satisfied with product"
RHOPVM721RZMZ,5,I have been using these Headphones at work for a couple years now and I still love them. I work in a cubical most of the time however I move around the office often and don't always have a full charge on my phone. With these I eliminated one more required cord on my desk as well now I am free to move about the whole office without needing to carry my phone with me. I also connect them to my PC and they sound just as good.<br /><br />I recommended these to everyone I work with that complains about there headphones or there headphones tether.<br /><br />Been using the headphones since 2012 and they are still sounding and looking great! I use them more at home now for a way too listen to my favorite music as I wind down from the day's activities.
R2CF7LRTLI6HUX,5,I really love this product. It is well worth the money I paid.  Good quality and durability. I highly recommend it.
RGEUGUCHQ9BU4,4,Fits and sounds well.  I can move around the house with it on.  It is very comfortable and I would recommend it.
R3VA0AOM5STVPE,5,"I bought this for my husband who has trouble hearing the TV. He loves the sound quality, and that it gives him the ability to hear the TV without the volume blaring. I like it very much, too!"
R1914P2EDCSIVW,5,"They provide sound as clear as a bell, even several rooms away.<br />You can take a bathroom break and know when you have to be back with these."
R3SEGC67DP7C3N,5,I got these for my husband and he loves them.  He can walk around the house with them on and still hear the tv with no static.  He says as long as the tv volume is not blasting then there is no feedback.  That is not a problem as my hearing is just fine.  These are very nice quality.  I would recommend these for anyone with hearing problems.
R3FA0POIUUM0IY,3,"Wanted wireless headphones just to watch tv at night without disturbing those sleeping.  Works greatfor that purpose. I wouldn't say the sound quality is great for those wanting to listen to music, but I sm just plugging them into my audio receiver headphone jack. Sound qualitymay be better if I was using RCA jack audio out ports."
R1P8821KB1PJ5B,5,"I live in an apartment and work 3rd shift, so frequently watch TV at about 7am on weekdays and don't want to wake my neighbors. Also, I tend to watch movies at 2-5am on weekends and that would surely wake my neighbors. So, I bought these.<br /><br />After a little trouble honing in on the signal due to very touch controls, I achieved very good sound. There's still static when I turn them on but as soon as they pair with the base station (when the TV show or movie makes its first sound) then they sound great.<br /><br />My only problem is a minor one: Because the recharge station and antenna are one, the headphones are required to be near the TV when not in use. I don't mind it but it's a (minor) constraint on your TV room's design."
R1NPS6F9SZ60ZQ,5,This product was chosen to allow my wife to see and listen to the bedroom tv and not bother me while I sleep. I need quiet to go and stay asleep. This works perfectly. The fidelity and comfort of the headphones allows long usage. Great product.
R1Y4XA32C4VRWB,1,"Sound good when working, but they are old tech now. 2004!<br />Don't get them if you plan to use them watching tv in bed. If you lay back on your pillow they either push forward off of your ears or they change the volume or tuning on the dials that are on the back.<br />The foamy material itches.<br />Heaven forbid these things are on your ears when the sound drops out ....BBBBLLLLAAAAAMMMMM! a scream of white noise blasts on for no reason.<br />They are highly rated because most of reviews were from 2005 and 2006 when this was like magic to the natives. No wires? That's amazing!<br />Sent them back and got the pendant, in-ear type."
R2I4G7K3EKPHSR,4,"The wireless headphone is great. The sound comes through clearly. The only problem is when my headphones are plugged into the receiver, the sound is off for anyone else that wants to hear."
R1RC524FHMI71I,4,"Maybe I get spoiled by my LG bluetooth headset and my Shure ear buds, but while the sound is really complete in these (possibly better than my Shures) they slide off my head when doing dishes, and I wear a 7 1/2 hat.<br /><br />I think I'll move them to the bedroom and get a bluetooth transmitter for the receiver.<br /><br />But not waking up my sleeping wife and infant baby during playoffs...priceless."
RPTKM27823UNG,4,"I was so excited about this product. I live in a small apartment and my husband is senstive to noise, so I usually wear headphones when I am watching TV alone. I had a setup with a long cord that I was always tripping over, and/or unplugging myself. Last year I bought a cheap pair of wireless headphones at a discount store, and I couldn't get them to work so I gave up for a while. I decided to spend more and assumed I'd get what I paid for, and at first I was very happy. I got these, charged them as instructed for 24 hours, and the first 6 or 7 times I used them they lasted the whole time I was watching TV (at least 3-4 hours) and I was able to walk all around our entire apartment without any disturbance. They are also very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. I was so happy with these headphones! However...since then, the next two times I have used them the batteries have crapped out after LESS then an hour. I am SO disappointed. Even more so since I was so pleased to begin with. My 3 rating is an average of 4+ for product performance and 2 for what I'm assuming/hoping is a crappy battery issue. The headphones are great, the batteries? Not so much.<br /><br />Update: 1/17/14<br /><br />After further use, I have figured out that the issue is not the battery at all. I realized that both times they had quit on me, I had the show I was watching paused. If the transmitting device is not transmitting any sound, after a few minutes they headphones cut out. They come right back on as soon as the sound is turned on again. So I am revising my stars to 4, really more like 4.5, I'm very happy with them. The only slight complaint is that they are flat and don't cup over my ears, so they get a little hot after I've been wearing them for a while, but that's a pretty minor issue for me."
R2J87MJM1QO34D,2,"Had high hopes for these headphones but they disappointed me with excessive noises and static. OK, so I have &#34;golden ears&#34; which is the audio industry term for people who have near perfect hearing.  I replaced them with the Sennheiser RS180 -at a much higher cost- and those are noise and static free.<br />Some people may never hear the noises and the static of the RS120 but if they do they can confidently trade up to the RS180."
RZ0QFGQOX3NTQ,5,"I bought these headphones based on the reviews and I'm so glad I bought them. My husband has hearing problems and turns the TV up very loud, we can hear it outside! He loves these headphones because he says that they sound like he's at a movie theater and they are very very comfortable. He says he actually hears the TV better with the headphones on than with the TV blaring at it's loudest. The quality of the sound is amazing, this is a great product. I would recommend these to anyone who wanted good quality wireless headphones."
R33OPZQ664UU3B,5,My boyfriend is hard of hearing and I am most definitely not.  He keeps the television so loud that it makes me crazy so I bought these for him for Christmas.  I LOVE THEM!  I have used them myself and they work very nicely.  We have no issues with any white noise associated with them.  My only wish is that they could be linked to the television AND the DVD player (we do not use cable).
R2Y98Y5JTTKERF,4,"I had Sony ear phones before, and they gave me trouble from the day I purchased them. The Sennheiser really work well, and being a hearing impaired person these are just what I needed."
R2CZITYQEMYT5A,5,"The base stopped working with rattling sound, seemed like something broke in it.. Not sure if kids dropped it (they say they didn't) since the base is not very stable and can fall easily... I sent it to Sennheiser with their prepaid UPS and they sent me a free replacement unit right away, no question asked..."
R35QSL9S2EJK0U,5,"These headphones sound great and they actually work a lot farther away than you would expect.  I have to pull the headset off a little to hear for outside hazards, but I can walk outside of my house (brick/lead construction from the 1950s) and still hear my music."
R2F0GIPXWN7W3T,5,"I wear hearing aids and these Headphones I could not live without.  They are great for anyone who are, just a little bit hard of hearing, they make every thing so much more clear.  Exceptional!!  I've had these for 2 and half years."
R2A0GDCRFFJVPJ,4,"+ Nice cradle for charging and storage.<br />+ Uses standard AAA NiMH rechargables. Can charge these in the cradle.<br />+ Sounds pretty decent.<br />+ Comfortable ear pads.<br />+ Comes with adapter for 3.5mm jack, 1/4\\"" jack, and RCA jacks.<br />+ The headphones turn off automatically when you drop them onto the charger.<br /><br />- The wireless audio transmission is analog not digital.<br />- There is a wheel on the headphones to tune the receiving signal, and a slider on the base to select the frequency. This wheel is annoying and easily accidentally disturbed.<br />- Slight background hiss in the headphones, can't tune it out.<br />- Sometimes moving around can generate short bursts of static. You might be able to tune it out depending on how much interference there is in the area you're using them.<br />- The charging light stays lit red even if the batteries are full. (I wish it indicated when charging is complete by turning green.)"
R3N1A78VEMU4JA,4,"crisp clear sound, nice bass.  I researched a few similar products before settling on this one.  Very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone"
R1SSJ8FQS0NFQZ,5,"I purchased this to reduce the wires connecting to my computer while gaming. It was bought from a third party through Amazon at a reduced price as it was an &#34;open box&#34; offer. The other reviews indicated some people didn't like the fit. I have found them to be quite comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The only objection I had was that they were in the original box and listed &#34;as new&#34;, but they came without the rechargeable batteries. Fortunately I had a pair and they have been working very well ."
R28BPG485XN8OY,4,"It was a little hard setting it up, but once I did I have loved them ever since. I would recommend these if you have a family of women and just wanna stop hearing them complaining."
R3D62B2C03MQOG,4,Good quality sound and comfortable fit.. Lets you listen to tv or music wirelessly and no one else will hear.
R3SLYB27EKLP1J,5,"Good sound, my wife can hear sounds she never heard before using these headphones.  She literally cried when she first put them on while listening to one of her movies."
R2QXB67KRMD4VG,3,"If you have a Panasoic TV, please check with them regarding compatibility before ordering this device.  The Sennheiser RS120 DOES NOT WORK with my TV, which is an LCD TV, Model Number TC-L42E50.  However the headphones work very well on my 2007, 32 inch Westinghouse, which is in the bedroom and used about 6 hours a year."
R1XBPBLSYKQT6E,2,"The phones are heavy, hot, and uncomfortable. Didn't even try out the audio system to see if it worked because I can't wear these things."
R106XPJOY6NZ22,5,My husband is delighted to have the headphones.  He can now understand what the stars are saying when their voices get low and hard to understand.  He also keeps the TV at a lower level when viewing.
R3GNC4M24322L3,4,The earphones produce excellent quality of sound. My only objections are: 1. the ear cups don't fit tight enough to prevent sound bothering my wife; she says she can hear tv with the sound muted. They also don't fit tightly enough to pre4vent falling off my head if I lean over while standing.
R3JBSK3ZG93DQM,2,Works well with some tv's. But not with others. Hard to tune to correct frequency or channel.  Need to try various sets of headphones to determine correct one for your purposes.
R3PA08RQDNJORG,5,"I already had two sets from many years ago, and just couldn't find them for a gift for my wife..They are an excellent item, and this is why I would give it 5 stars.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for great sound and quality."
RXUXRZYJBIAAD,5,Great product - the  best Wireless Earphones  i have ever had.  Now need to see how long it will last.
R3QF9NFS421QV5,3,I bought these for my husband to watch TV with but they slip and slide all over the place. We wished there was a way to adjust them but couldn't find any.
R18DR9FG9JQNAX,3,"The product it´s ok but not perfect because it often catches noise from another sources of sound, for example I can hear voices from radio station."
R3DYQ3D0ZJHN8R,5,I purchased these headphones last Christmas for my son-in-law and for my husband this Christmas and they both love them.  They have clear sound and they can move around the house and not lose any quality in sound.
R12US0ZQ7XCLSJ,5,I bought two for each TV in two separate rooms.  I can have the base on different channels and use both headphones with either base.
R2N3I6XMWLY4YC,5,"This headphone set allows my husband to multi task, listening to a game while in the next room on the computer. No high volume in the house, only sweet quiet."
RY229ATGM7IVH,5,I purchased this for my mom who normally needs to blast her TV to hear it. Now with these headphones she has the volume about half volume she would normally have and it's super clear. It's so good my dad is getting one also.
R2HBH2V2FO4L3S,3,"First to be clear: these are good headphones. For wireless, they are very good. I have to believe the reviews that say they are the best wireless headphones out there. The big question is: do you absolutely need wireless? If yes, then buy these. But if you can make do with a really long cord, then I would go for wired headphones any time.<br /><br />Pros:<br />They work well, have good bass, look good and feel good. So you can listen to your favorite tunes, walk around, and they will last long enough (with good batteries).<br /><br />Cons:<br />There's always a bit of fuzz, the batteries do run out, which is annoying. And because the whole set is a bit bulky, you pretty much have to leave the base station in one spot. You can move it from stereo to TV, but it takes wiring, plugging, several parts."
R1WIO850DG9E8A,5,"Amazing sound, nice tone beautiful base. Easy to get to volume and adjustment. On/ off switch is easy also to work. Only complaint is its a tad loose on my head. Even adjusted to lowest size. But Ive lost 5050 pounds due to cancer so Im allot smaller. But my review is on the quality for the price, simply can't beat this set of wireless headphones."
RVNNSBAMNR8LD,5,"Bought as gift for husband but I use them too.  Very nice.  Feels good on ears (different set we had made my ears hurt, this one does not.). Clear sound, easy to operate.<br />The absolute only negative I find is they they will fall off your head if you bend over (old set, other brand we had always stayed on). Still, I give these a five star rating as they work so well!"
R1G1QMN7DVMJMW,1,"The base unit would not take the power cord or power up.<br />Because the product didn't work out of the box, I gave it a very poor rating. I will be returning it very shortly for an exchange with the hope that the next one I receive is in working order."
R1QDWMEGEXH1W6,5,"esta marca SENNHEISER nunca la habia comprado a pesar de su buena fama , este modelo es excelente , el sonido bastante aceptable aunque no impactante pero bueno , el acabado del producto es expectacular , la antena receptora es muy fuerte y tiene tremenda receptividad sin interrupciones y ruidos molestos , es grande pero ligero y super comodo , las baterias aaa rinden bastante y el diseño para colaborar con la decoracion es expectacular y de primera , comprenlo no se arrepentiran !<br /><br />SENNHEISER this brand never had bought despite its reputation, this model is excellent, the sound quite acceptable but not impressive but good, the finished product is spectacular, the receiving antenna is very strong and has tremendous receptivity without interruptions and noise annoying, is large but lightweight and super comfortable, the aaa batteries render fairly and design to assist with the decoration is spectacular and first, buy it will not regret!"
R2H4ASVF3IZ5P1,5,"I purchased these headphones to replace some Sony headphones that had come with my Sony TV when I purchased it. The Sony headphones had quit working and I could not find the same ones to replace. I looked at the reviews of headphones and these seemed to have the best reviews overall so I purchased them. They are very good quality and have good clarity on sound. The only negative is that they get heavy and hurt your ears after you have worn them for a while. Otherwise, I am well pleased."
R18ZBEF9ZCGWAZ,2,I bought these hoping they would work on my television so my husband could watch it while I slept.  Didn't work.  Tried it on each TV in the house.
RB74EMMI5R43N,4,"This product solved the difficulties my wife and I have hearing and understanding the audio portions of TV broadcasts. The product works as advertised and, is comfortable to wear for extended periods. The controls are easy to access while in use. Although there is always the possibility of electronic interference, I have not experienced it nor have I had to take extraordinary measures either.<br />Price is reasonable and unit delivers satisfying results"
R2BYXJMVG7ZV60,2,It is a waste of money go for higher models. This model hiss and noise level makes useless. I own for a long time now but hardly use it due to hiss.
R2VN2YZUM79C9S,5,I have a mild hearing problem.  I hear sounds loud enough but it is difficult to understand what people are saying on TV. These headphones work very well and also enhance the quality of the music.  They are comfortable and convenient.  The price is great for the quality. I recommend them Highly
REOZJGBUNPKN8,5,These work just great for my application.  I purchased an additional two pair of rechargeable batteries and when the ones in the head phones go dead I just change them out.
R3FO2CVW25KV1H,5,"These headphones are AMAZING!!<br /><br />I purchased this product to enjoy TV in the comfort of my own home, thus blocking out the continuously intrusive noise coming from my new neighbors.  Those who are in the same situation will (sadly) know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />The sound quality is incredible.  It's almost as if you are in the same room as the characters on the program you are watching.  Also, (and more to the point), I am enjoying my solitude once again.  No door/cabinet/drawer slamming or dog barking.<br /><br />It is of course, not a perfect solution to the noise problem.  Ideally, the neighbor's silence would be best.  But alas, as that's not likely to happen any time soon, this is a superb resolution and a Godsend!<br /><br />For anyone else in this same predicament, I also recommend [[ASIN:B001F5VDVE Flents Quiet Time Soft Comfort Ear Plugs  50 Pair]] and [[ASIN:B004U4A5RU Howard Leight 1030110 Sync Noise-Blocking Stereo Earmuff]].  You can buy both on Amazon.  (Please note, you can find the earplugs at your local Walmart as well)."
RU9O0OLSVS7GN,4,The unit performs extremely well.  It is useable in all parts of my home (max distance 60 feet)  Headset battery insertion is<br />quite easy and only time will indicate its stability.<br />One minor drawback is the size of the headset ON-OFF switch.  It is extremely small thus requires feeling around to locate it.<br />Also an &#34;on&#34; lite  (pinpoint LED) would be useful.<br />The on ear headphone is fine but it won't sit well if you are planning to lie in bed and watch TV.  Must sit up!.<br />The charging cradle works well and contains an indicator for both &#34;charging&#34; and a separate one for &#34;transmitting&#34; A nice touch.<br /><br />Overall a definite &#34;bang&#34; for the buck.
R3BGKMV1IEFSC6,3,As with the warrantee it is too soon to give an acurate review of this product as I have only used it for 15 days
ROLJ8RIT5LPUP,3,"Having little experience with headphones I have nothing to compare them to. They will certainly work at quite a distance, but somewhat of a balancing act to keep them from falling off doing yard work. Don't wear them while cleaning the toilet. Good sound quality but for the bucks you would think one would be able to adjust bass and treble to suit taste."
R2B9F3ZITHPDB,5,"My husband and I have opposite tastes when it comes to watching TV.  He would plug in his old earphones and it meant having to watch the cord--then he found these.  What a mixed blessing--more so for me I am afraid.  What is really wonderful, he can walk all over the house without missing anything.  What is bad for me, is he leaves them on and can ignore what I am saying!!"
R1Y85I9ZA0CMV8,5,"my husband (and family) loved these for christmas (my two year old loves to put them on). The sound from the TV is SO MUCH clearer, and now he can watch loud action movies after the baby is in bed!"
R7PI0N5L6IAB6,5,"Bought this to use at home so that my wife or I could sleep while the other watched TV.  Works like a charm, good volume and can tweak the tuning to listen without static or buzzing."
RQTQ1Q2ZUNHYP,5,"Transmits TV sound to anywhere in the house.  Unconvertional battery positioning so look close when installing, because they don't work with incorrect battery positioning."
R2B0JPKML838BA,4,I have not had any problems with these headphones. I never have to retune them (unless my three year old got ahold of them). The sound quality is great. They were easy to setup and I use them everyday.
R999CE71MH45,4,It's not the best range but sounds good and clear and comfortable.  Not super comfortable like Bose but still good.
R2659LG0C4TRYV,4,"I tried one of the $15 TV headphone units from that HFT tool store. Junk. Returned it. Was skeptical of these, but decided to try as the TV is getting evermore difficult to understand. Plus the wife has 'turbo ears' and can hear a snail fart a mile away. So its a constant conflict. To resolve, I just avoid TV is she is in the room. Well, these things seem to work great. I hear a much greater range of sound than with naked ear. Only minor complaint is that the phones sit kinda forward on my head, and have a tendency to fall off if I lean down a little. Also, would be nice if they were smaller and made a better ear seal. Overall, I am pleased with teh purchase."
R8DSCM0ECVO80,5,"I am extremely happy with this purchase. I chose to order the headphones through Amazon's &#34;used&#34; warehouse, which was categorized as &#34;like new&#34;. It really was &#34;like new&#34; and came in the original box. It was super easy to set up. I plugged it into the &#34;constant&#34; out plug and played with the channel settings to see what worked best. I have no interference at all or any other &#34;hissing&#34; that I've heard people complain about. On the contrary, the sound is crystal clear! I have travelled to every corner of my house, with no problems at all.<br /><br />I love being able to listen to whatever I want without bothering my family (I have two very young children). I have my Television running through my stereo. When I get up early in the morning to get ready for work, I will put on music while I prepare my breakfast. Once I'm done and sitting down to eat, I'll turn off the music and turn on the Netflix. You know how many of the new movies have extremely loud sound effects and very soft dialogue? I can finally hear everything the actors are saying without blasting the stereo and waking the family.<br /><br />Long story short, I love these cordless headphones."
RS6MX8TDFXGLT,5,My husband loves the headphones.  He states that they work great and he could hear everything.  He's watched shows that he previously watched without the headphones and he now can hear every word spoken.
R2FERVBQJND30Y,4,"These sound great. I can even where them outside while blowing snow in the driveway and listen to Pandora on my AV system, coming through the new Samsung Smart TV"
R2E2I0X0AQ467I,1,"Buyer beware - I ordered these headphones based off the high customer ratings.  When I received the headphones I tried to plug them into my TV as instructed.  Red cable in red audio out put and black (not white) in the white out put.  Or use the head phone jack.<br /><br />I have a Sanyo HD TV I bought last year that I wanted to use with these head phones.  There is only an orange digital audio output and no head phone jack.  I also have a Samsung Plasma TV so I looked at that as well.  Same thing, only an orange out put.<br /><br />I called Sennheiser twice to ask what I needed to do.  Both times I had to leave a voice mail with tech support.  I never received a call back.<br /><br />I went to my local Radio Shack that sells these exact headphones and asked what I needed.  The Manager explained that with new TV's you have to buy a $40 converter and a $10 cable to make the head phones work with new TV's that have digital output.  He said that the head phone companies haven't caught up with the TV's yet.  I am returning the head phones."
R5HJVOESD4PTF,5,"First purchased one for my Mom, 86 years old.  The sound is great, but she did have trouble finding the volume on the right ear phone.  Also, bought one for my mother-in-law, 95 years old.  She has an easier time finding the volume control, and since she lives with us, I don't have to hear the program she is watching all over the house.  Instead I love my quiet house, and she enjoys her shows.  And sometimes when we watch the same show together, I don't have to have the TV louder than what's comfortable for me. Through these headphones I love the sound for music and TV shows after everyone else has gone to bed, I don't have to worry that I'm keeping them awake (my daughter also lives with us)."
R1I3TVWVHXGOSU,5,Ordered this head phone set for a very hard of hearing person.  It has been received well!  and the best thing is that he can leave his hearing aids in!  They are easy to operate and very comfortable.  Pleased with my purchase!
R2KR2GS7JXQLNO,1,"The range on these things is really good. Sounds good. Charging station IS the transmitter. Weight of the headset is nice and light, and you can easily get replacement parts or an entire new headset that works with the station. I really wanted these to work.<br /><br />BUT these headsets have a flat earcup to them, and that little part of the earlobe that sticks out, it just DIGS INTO.<br />I tried, honest to goodness, tried to make these work but omfg, any1 could easily see where these just killed my earlobes after just a few minutes of wearing them. And if you have a problem like me, do NOT get headphones that have flat earcups, get ones that go around the ears or in the ears or anything else."
R1QA1QPGEY823L,5,"My husband wanted something for the tv in our bedroom, it is a constant back and forth between us because I think the tv is too loud and he can't hear what is being said. This was a great solution. We actually plugged the headphones directly into the dvr which lets the headphones volume work independently from the television. I can set the volume on the tv for me and he can turn his headphones as loud as he wants.<br /> As I said in the title, these do not cancel ambient noise, though with the volume up my husband says he can't really hear anything else going on in the house. Just a warning to those who might be thinking they do.<br /> They charge very easily as well, just drop them on the stand, though you want to make sure the charge light comes on. Overall we are very pleased with these. They are perfect for what we needed them for."
R1FH9EVW93YJME,5,These are great. They do exactly what I wanted them to do.  I would recommend these to every one. These have great sound.
R3UIPOMP5P18SX,5,I can actually hear what is being said on TV!!! I hear words clearly and don't have to rely on context. I can leave the room and still hear the dialogue so I don't miss any of the story or action in a movie. Where were these years ago? More than worth the money.
R343IXUIKZRU3U,5,I love these headphones.  The range is awesome and the sound is very clear.  I use it for TV and instead of a headset for Xbox.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.
RZW8F8MJ51DWM,5,These headphones are perfect for my use. My home is 90 feet long and the base is located at one end. I can go anywhere in my home with no interference. Very pleased.
R3LT5LXL95PAQ5,5,I'm very happy with the Sennheiser wireless headphones I purchased.  They were easy to hook up to my TV and work flawlessly!
RQ0FJGGU8TDZ0,5,Bought it for my wife so that she can listen to her shows without bothering me. We've had it for about 2 years now. It has amazing range. She can hear it from the other side of the house in my son's room. The sound quality is very good and it was very easy to setup. It lives up to what I would expect from the Sennheiser brand of audio products.
R3E9LE6UT4LQ6G,4,My husband works late and I'm sleeping by the time he gets home. These are perfect for us. They are comfortable around your ears and light weight. The only dislike is they are bulky. Would be nice if they were a bit smaller
R1TRW5YRPV6PIT,1,"Buyer beware, these headphones do not work with plasma televisions! They do not tell you this anywhere except in a troubleshooting section buried deep in the manual. Very annoying!"
RUJ4FUW09Y5VL,5,We bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift. He keeps saying that he just can't believe that he can hear the TV.  We are thrilled that he and my mother can watch TV together and that each can have the volume adjusted to suit their needs. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a family member with a severe hearing loss.
R2AHUC9TB92ZUF,5,"I purchased this for my father who is hard of hearing and he refuses to wear a hearing aid. He prefers to watch TV late at night when his wife and mother in law are sleeping and before using this product he would wake everyone up because he had the sound on the TV cranked up very high, this often caused huge arguments in his household. I purchased this for him on his birthday and its the best gift every says his wife; my father wears this every night and he loves it because now he hears everything and everyone else isn't bothered by his TV viewing. I'm thinking of purchasing one for myself."
R3EL4XWS0O9U7J,4,They work great at normal distances (10' - 20') but you start getting static if you go much further.  I haven't had any problems with interference and the sound quality seems to be as good as what I get with my Onkyo receiver and Advent Legacy speakers connected to my TV with optical SPDIF.  I'm very pleased with these headphones overall and I recommend them.
R2I6K7GUZZ83X2,5,"Tried Sony Wireless Headphones before and these are far supperior in price, sound, comfort and every other way. Would reccomend to my friends."
R1R54MPFHNH6S2,4,"The Headphones work great, however they can not be adjusted and when one leans forward they fall off the head."
R196T6EGQURY0Q,3,"I purchased for my wife, thinking it was similar to the Sennheiser RS 180. Upon arrival and close examination, I found the quality of sound excellent. It also carried the sound throughout the four floors of living area we have. However, in comparison to the RS180 (that is more expensive), the casing is much more sensitive to hand touch, which is somewhat annoying. And the design of the head band is not as fit and comfortable as the RS 180. So I decided to spurge and buy another RS 180."
R1QFECJAU177H2,4,"This is the second Sennheiser wireless headphone set I've owned. The first was damaged in shipping during a move; after 6 years of daily use, they were not salvageable. I am profoundly hearing impaired. These phones are simply the BEST of the dozens I've tried through the years. Sound quality is very good, they are well made, simple and reliable. The operating range allows for use anywhere in the home or outdoors. I love them. Thanks for a great product."
R2JPARAA0IJ4JV,5,I gave these headphones as a gift.  The recipients report that the headphones were easy to install and work great.
RH1MHYC7M62SL,5,"My son received these as a present and he is really enjoying them.  The sound is great, he likes that they are wireless except that in a car they are not. We are very pleased with them."
R2PLFW8NUMELCS,5,"My husband doesn't hear well and he plays the TV so loud it drives me out of the house!  I got him these so he could hear the TV even if it is down low enough that it cannot be heard in the same room.  IT WORKS!  He is thrilled with them.  Comfortable. Drowns out other noises.  Works great.  He walked several houses down to the mailbox and he could still hear the TV through them. Of course, he couldn't hear a car coming....but he could hear his football game!  lol  Only issue is that now the TV is very quiet but when he wears them, he talks very loudly and doesn't realize it!  COME ON SENNHEISER --  Come up with a contraption that will turn HIS volume down and I will be happy at last.  lmao"
R19BWQWVBTR03B,5,I bought this for my husband and he just loves the headphones! I love them too. I don't hear the t.v. Or video games and he doesn't hear my t.v. In the other room. He says the sound is clear and other noises are blocked out. He can even walk from room to room with them on and never miss what's playing on the t.v. We would definitely recommend this product.
R1RTKIS809QSMQ,3,"It's a pretty cool product unfortunately if doesn't work if you're watching netflix on your xbox or playstation. It only works if you're watching cable tv, which I don't have. So it's almost useless with out cable."
R37TQYL3OBC9BD,2,"I have experienced problems. Also, I misplaced the operating manual, the phone number to call for help, and my receipt."
R3KSYXGU3O2CS3,5,"Works great!  Occasionally has a static-sounding interruption, but 99.9% of the time it's wonderful!<br />Finally our family room is a family room again!  Now our young daughter and I can stay in the area and do our own things as husband watches movies that have scary sounds like gun blasts and car chases.  We can eat in peace in the next room, read in peace in the same room, and so forth.<br />Husband needs hearing aids but is young enough that vanity wins out, and it was a real problem for kidlet and me.  But this way he can do what he wants and we can all enjoy ourselves.  He can even take a minute from his sports watching to use the loo or empty the dishwasher -- and not miss the audio.  The range is pretty good!<br />I just wish the cradle could be a little further away from the TV itself."
R3V2MXAYC4KAEG,5,"I can walk through my house without a problem, it is mounted in my bed room at one end of the house, I have a 1500 square foot home."
R3Q2WTIW6KGZNL,5,I bought these for my wife as she is always needing to turn up the TV to hear her movies. She is so pleased as not only can she turn the sound to what ever level she want but she claim that the voices are clearer. She also like the freedom to walk around and not miss anything.
R3EQ1NKSR6YD4I,4,"The headphones kicked in with static, at first uses, after about 30 minutes.  I contacted technical assistance, and a technician suggested a reconnection, and they now work satisfactorily.  I have had the phones for a month."
RHJRY7ZVKB017,4,"this is a fairly good set of wireless headphones.  The charging stand/base is good and recharges the headphones nicely.  You sometimes have to use the tuner knob on the side to tune it to the best frequency but once you do, it works well.  My biggest issue with these headphones is that the ear cushions are shaped completely flat to rest on the ears.  They don't have a depression or shaped to cup the ears.  Therefore they have a tendency to slide down slightly rather than stay put on your ears.  can be annoying."
R2QDS366DFXJKH,5,"The item is great, and got here quick.<br /><br />My husband loved them. The quality eas fantastic!<br />It was a great gift."
R3T5PLRUQ3819F,3,"It's been about a year since we purchased the headphones and they have given good service. However, They are too wide for my head and have to hold them close to really hear, there is no really good way to adjust them. My husband is whom they were purchased for and he has no complaints."
RM3OBMWO2MINR,4,"These were purchased for a friend who has hearing issues. He had lost the ability to hear movies and TV without having the volume to a point that kept his family awake at night. This little unit fixed that issue.<br /><br />Here are a few points that I was a bit foggy on until purchasing these headphones.<br /><br />Connections - the base unit has left and right RCA audio plugs that go into your TVs &#34;audio out&#34;. It includes adapters for 3.5mm and 1/4&#34; connections.<br /><br />Sound - since you're using the &#34;audio out&#34; on your TV sound will always go to the headphones. That way others in the room can listen to the TV at a normal level allowing the person using the headphones to turn it up as much as they need. Or at night you can turn the TV sound all the way down and just use the headphones to make sleeping for the family easier.<br /><br />Charging - the headphones have built in contacts that match up to the wire holder. When you place the headphones on the holder the &#34;charging&#34; light comes on.<br /><br />Reception - as others have stated, standing close to the base unit results in static. You have the ability to swap channels on the base unit and there is a tuning knob on the headphones that allows you to fine tune them to be static free.<br /><br />Quality - very good sound reproduction that results in clear and rich listening.<br /><br />Overall my friend was amazed at how much he'd been missing. Now he can hear everything while watching TV. He's also able to watch movies again, something he'd missed very much but stopped doing because he couldn't hear half the movie. That's not an issue anymore."
RQ35WS9F8DS4H,5,"This  gift worked out to be a Great present for my husbands volume and me not asking him to lower the volume..... a win , win gift..."
R1JPKOM4YBCNTD,4,"Head phones work well with my system. Works as advertised, great sound, comfortable fit, good value for the price of the unit."
R2XSV7SJSTNXUZ,5,"If you have a spouse that is driving you nuts with turning the volume up on the tv, you need these headphones.  Quality of sound is great for him, and everyone else in the house is a lot happier.  Now if we could only keep him from yelling at the refs during a late basketball game, we would be in heaven."
R3QOAX2IBR1JEB,5,Very good device<br /><br />No annoying background noise.<br /><br />If you ever have an issue about losing connection I found that all you have to do is raise the volume.<br /><br />Then it never loses the connection again.
R16O7ER647B1J7,5,"I have a job where I get up very early like 4 am, my wife like to watch TV in bed and for the most part it didn't bother me but the few times it did not only I couldn't get to sleep but then I was unable to fall asleep. Now she uses them all the time I have yet to have a problem falling asleep because of the TV."
R3C6N0PMZXKQ01,4,"I would give 5 stars if another headset could mate with it. Bought these for GF's daughter because she thought she would be borrowing our RS180's at night, as her TV is mounted on the other side of the wall from our bed. WRONG!!! Her sleep cycle is about 6 hours out of phase with ours, so I wasn't about to be wrestling with her to return the phones back to the living room before she went to sleep. I picked up this set, then realized she has friends over sometimes. Oh well. It's a nice sounding set though, she loves them. These are radio frequency with a tuning knob, so there can be interference if not tuned in just right. Overall, not an issue."
R1ZCS00XICPH,5,"Bought this for my dad to watch TV at his own volume without disturbing everyone else. He loves them. He had some cheaper in ear wireless headphones and were not good. He actually said &#34;I have never head such good quality sound. They're AWESOME&#34;. Range is excellent, gets reception over 50 ft away. No interference or crackling/hissing. Durability we'll have to see about over the long term, but seems good.<br /><br />Highly recommend"
R2WD2QP2UK7CO5,5,I can hear everything very clearly especially when playing video games.  I like the way the padding is under the head gear of the headphones.  I was able to wear headphones at least three hours without getting a headache. These headphones are great!
R16E904XO65IA9,5,"I'm hard of hearing and play the TV way too loud for my wife's liking. For the sake of spousal harmony I bought these, and everything is now bless.  The fidelity is great, they recharge quickly and the charge lasts a long time. My minor complaints are that they are not very size adjustable, and will fall off my heed if I lean over, and the instructions could have been better. But overall a great purchase."
R10KYH607K96BX,5,These headphones are just what I wanted and I am very pleased with their performance.  I would recommend them to anyone.
R2Y6DMHA3PNPQ8,5,Love dealing with Amazon...product arrived earlier than scheduled with no problems. Just plugged in unit to the audio out on the TV and let it charge for 24hrs.Sound is excellent...much better than the TV Ears I had.  Need to roll the tune selector until<br />the sound is clear.  Volume adjustment provides enough volume where I don't need full on.I have 50% lost of hearing in both ears and use it without hearing aids...no problem. Earlier post said headset was tight on the head but mine fits comfortably.  I thought price was very reasonable compared to TV Ears and is much sturdier  Highly recommend this product<br />texmex louie
R14ACXCC2EMOAF,5,"was recommended to me by a relative.  Is great, husband can watch tv without blasting the sound.  Like that it recharges right in its own cradle.  Not just need to get husband to use it more often."
R1GTU86A1MAC6E,5,This unit replaced another one that had given out.  It worked great from the time it arrived and I would recommend this item to others.  My wife uses it when she does not want to disturb others and has commented that the sound quality is very good.  She has been pleased with the charging process and the length of the time she can use it.  We have been very pleased with this unit.
R3SFMLVTT4U8UO,1,"I purchased these headphones to use with my bass guitar headphone amplifier; the regular headphones had a short cord, and I had to stand still while playing through it.<br />I like Sennheiser products (I have a great microphone from them), so I gave these a try.  I quickly learned that these headphones have no ability to handle low frequencies, even at very low volume.  There was a lot of distortion and a boomy sound anytime low tones were played, even through my iPhone.<br />I suppose these would be OK to listen to talk radio on, or very quiet TV shows with no music or explosions / loud, deep noises.<br />I'm returning these."
R1YBQWTMX3YPKN,3,"The wireless headphones work fine.  The sound is crisp & clear.  My only problem is with the charging.  We've been using them over a month now, and the charging light does not come one unless we put something on top of the earphones when sitting in the cradle.  The connection only works if we push down on the earphones, like maybe something is out of wack."
R2X9LP2PWMUEVD,5,"This is referenced as the best in a beginning, reasonable category and I am enjoying it side by side with the first 120 series.  They are top of the line wireless while being more than reasonably priced."
R153XMXF83BAXQ,5,"I purchase this set to replace an old cheap set, that had quit working. I was amazed at the sound, it is worth the money I paid. I highly recommend this wireless headphone to anyone who is in doubt of which to choose from."
RQ7FG1T0F8IA5,5,"There should be a notice in the box that tells the new user that the GREEN LED will not light (even after the wall adapter is plugged in) until the RCA Output connectors are plugged into an audio producing jacl of some sort. And so, install the batteries into the headset (be sure to double-check battery orientation), plug in the wall adapter, plug the base into an audio source and you're good to go. BE SURE to charge the new batteries 24 hour BEFORE using the headset - if you want the batteries to last otherwise have at it ..."
R3QC6HBYDK9U88,3,Liked the quality of the sound but outside interference became an insurmountable obstacle ... tried every suggested fix but nothing worked. Disappointing ...
R26DW7EOPS4L1K,5,"I bought these for my husband's Christmas gift . After charging the ear phones and finding his favorite music on-line, he was transported! Such crisp sounds and the comfortable noise cancelling earphones make it seem as if you are in the room with the artist.<br />These earphones are worth the money....!!  GO FOR THE GUSTO!"
RZDEQXIP0HZ4C,3,"Pros : Good battery life<br />  Good wireless range<br /><br />Cons: Average sound quality<br />  Hissing sounds at times (when move my head) - even after fine tuning<br />  Poor bass, sound cracks<br />  Doesn't cover my ears completely which make my ears hurt after awhile."
R3T51H3UV13SUT,4,"At first they were very hard to listen to, the interference was just too much. But after realizing that there is a switch on the receiver to change frequency bands, I was able to tune them correctly, and then I got almost perfect sound. Still a little interference, but for less than $100 they are very good."
R2EHYO8DVM0E3A,5,Now my husband can watch TV at night and not wake everyone up because the TV is way too loud.
RB291OM236XJO,4,"Sound is great... I wear glasses and my ears hurt after quite a while, from pressure of ear pieces against ears/glasses."
R1FLD17QWFAC5S,5,"I love these. I stay up later than everyone else in  my house and I love watching action films. It's very hard to have them at a volume you can hear the characters talking and not have the action music blaring through the house. With these headphones on I can hear everything clearly, beautifully and can even wonder through my house without interruption. When I listen to my music through them, I can have the volume up as loud as I want and the sound stays beautiful and true! I told my brother about him and he went online and bought a pair for himself as well."
RBII63EQEXSR6,5,"Got these for my dad, he is 81 years old and could no longer hear the TV.  He really is enjoying being able to hear.  With the improvement of his hearing with the headphones we have convinced him that hearing aids will help,! Thanks for your great product!!!"
R20SOSTW7HDT86,4,"With getting older and more background noise interfering with hearing the TV etc, I decided this was worth a try. It has helped a lot and I have enjoyed using them."
R3RR7L8OVNMS9N,1,The charger simply did not work (how difficult can it be to mfg a charger). The design of the power adaptor makes it difficult to plug-in.  The base is not substantial and feels cheap.  I was not able to judge sound quality since I could never charge the headphone batteries.<br />I suggest you save your money!
R1LR95J02O30GR,5,I was needing a set of wireless headphones for television listening and after reading several reviews I decided on the Sennheiser RS-120.  They are everything I hoped for.  Easy to set up and the audio quality is excellent for television.  I thought the price was very reasonable and I really like the combination charging cradle and transmitter base.  Just hang the headset on the cradle and it starts charging.  The range is excellent too.  I can leave the room and walk throughout the house and still hear the audio.  All praise and no complaints.
R14KY0TE9IZIOK,4,"This does what we want it to do--keeps noise contained. We use it with the TV so as not to disturb others who aren't in the mood to watch. A few issues:<br />1. Must adjust toning occasionally due to static<br />2. Would like the product to wrap around ears rather than being flush, as there is a great deal of pressure against the ears.<br />3. Not noise-cancelling<br />Otherwise, for the price they are great."
R3VU37QHPTI8WJ,4,"loved my sennheiser headphones, but now I am hearing buzzing on it. not sure if it goes bad after a while?"
R140A0GKZIIC6X,2,"I was not aware that the headset had on on/off switch and if I neglected to turn it off each time, the AAA batteries would run down quickly.  Then I realized the range of reception was significantly less than the older Sony I had worn out, Finally, they are not comfortable to wear and the stand doesn't fit easily on limited shelf space. I would not buy again, or recommend."
R1VJ74PAKWW0W1,5,"It's a good product, we've been used it the sound very clean and clear i my self like it; I would buy Sennhieser product again when I need it."
R2WUQLPEU093RN,4,"I have 1 set in the living rm and 1 in the bedrm. Bdrm because I like to watch T.V. when my hubby sleeps, so it doesn't bother him.<br />They have good tone and volume  control, however they could be a little lighter in weight. For the ladies they do have a tendency to mess the hair."
R1Z7704JTOJE0Z,3,The first one had a bad on/off switch .amazon quickly replaced it with another.the new one works fine.i bought a cheaper one elsewhere I and didn't work a tall.I learned .
RM181KDDZDZJW,5,Easy setup out of box with Vizio TV  Worked as advertised. Mostly deaf mother heard TV clearer than she has in years. Gave us the opportunity to watch TV together at a normal volume. She even likes to wear them when she is alone as she can hear all the words being said  Overall a great product for her and her visitors
R31SCGMINRVK7W,1,"These are the worst headphones I've ever heard.  The hiss is overwhelming.  My Living Presence CDs mastered in the 1950s have far less hiss than these.  I gave up less than a minute into Prokofiev's first symphony.  I was only a few feet away from the transmitter.  When I turned my head there was a loud swishing noise.  Considering all the positive reviews, maybe these work for hip-hop or something like that, but for classical music they're a complete failure."
R3URIFKQQUQ879,4,"I already had the Identical headphones for about 7 years and love them.  I was in need of an additional set for another room in my house so foolishly, I went to Best Buy and got another brand of wireless headphones which worked but did not have the range, clarity or volume my old Sennheiser and was disappointing. So I went online and was pleasantly surprised to see that Sennheiser was still making the RS 120 so I purchased it and it did not disappoint.  It had the same high volume of my old set so I could just set the headset next to me or around my neck and still hear with ease. My other one was silent when used this way. Also the range is crazy good. I live in a large house and I can go all over the property inside and out and never loose the signal!  I took the relatively new but poor headset and brought them to my work where I use them. The only con is that the charging system is a wire that charges the headset and if you bend the headset during normal use, you have to re bend the set back to it will fit on the charging station but is a minor problem."
R2KTTEXHQXY3O8,5,"We love this.  Used it first at a friends and liked it.  With the headsets on I can keep the volume good for me and my wife can listen at the level that suits her.  Also the range is very good.  Can wear it all around the house as well in the yard, up to 75 feet.  Also gave one to my dad this Christmas and he loves it also."
R1SJ42OFAJ89RK,2,Bought this unit  2 years ago.  Had great reviews etc..  worked great for 1.5 years..  then started having a problem.  Finally died...expected better quality from sennheiser.
RGRVWIGE40VPZ,5,My wife needs something to help her watch TV. This unit fill the bill 100%.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to my friends.
RZID3WR62BBPC,1,"I ordered the RS120 headphones as a Christmas gift for my Dad.  They will not come on and the power light will not light up so I am returning them tomorrow. The Sennheiser RS120's may be decent headphones based on the other reviews here on Amazon, but they look cheap and not well made so I am not taking another chance on them.  I am ordering the Sony's instead."
R29935TJOPO1SV,5,These headphones were for my husband who is hard of hearing.  This set is far superior to the old ones which blocked the sound from anyone watching tv with him.  This set allows others to hear a program at a comfortable volumne while the headset broadcasts at the level the one using it needs.
R238ZV903XF0HA,4,I must have headphones to enjoy TV with the family due to hearing difficulties.  I've had some bad luck picking a good pair so I was reluctant to spend too much money.  These headphones work very well.  Just wish they weren't so heavy.
R2CJ3SHHDNRUP3,1,"For something so expensive/highly rated, I expected this to last much longer than it has. It has sat broken/useless for six months now."
RLH9ZJQKV4N9M,4,"Bought this for my dad. There is now happiness and quiet in my parents home. No more loud TV or loud music,"
R3VQ9C06CBUJ9X,5,"I bought a set of these for work several years ago because I hate getting tangled in cords. I can walk all over my office area and never lose the connection. I have had zero interference. They sound great and are easy to maintain. The first set is more than 2 years old. I decided I needed one for my home office also, and am just as pleased with them as the first. I looked at many others, but for the price and features, these are the best value in my opinion. ~JTC~"
RROGFJZ4BP50F,3,"Sound quality not great, not noise canceling when being used, and I can hear the tv when my wife uses them. But it's still better than nothing and for the price I'd still buy them again."
RUG5HKMQT2QFL,4,"I love these headphones. The range is great and so is sound quality. My only complaint is the fit. They are too loose even at the smallest size. It's interesting there is an ability to make them a lot larger, but not very small. Granted I'm a female and my head isn't as large as a guy's; but it should be an easy fix to change them so the size could be reduced. One of my male co-workers also bought a set and it was too large for him too. We both had to modify them to fit. We used the headband for a hard hat. I used plastic cord ties to attach the headband to the headphones. Sure isn't very pretty, but the headphones stay on my head and that's what matters!  That's the only thing I think the company should change. Other than that, the headphones are perfect and I would recommend them and may even buy me another pair to take to work."
R3HYSUS8LTCCYX,4,"Bought one for my Grandson to use while practicing on his guitar and he loves it.  I already have one which I bought 3 years ago for the same purpose and love it.  The volume and tune dials are a little sensitive.  The battery lasts a long time.  Not being tethered to your CD/DVD player or IPad by a headphone cord while practicing works well, no tangles, tugging or pulling when you move about."
R2SLST6RDADGP0,3,"Positives:<br />Well these are defined as over the ear headphones, one can still pick up other outside sounds and voices due to the porosity of the ear foam pads (e.g. your wife commenting negatively on the TV show you are watching and being over the ear they allow you to pretend you cant hear....a great advantage).<br />Once I found the appropriate analog audio output and that manual tuning is required (see negatives) setup up was quick.<br />I like the convenience of the volume knob in the earpad.<br />The audio was crisp and clear and there was plenty of dynamic range, in other words I could adjust the volume to an uncomfortably high level well above my normal TV watching volume.<br />It comes with a couple of audio adapters but not a universal set, e.g. no RCA adapters..<br /><br />Negatives:<br />This unit only accepts analog audio inputs (right and left) which are becoming scarce on 21st century electronics so make sure you have those available for your application.<br />There are 3 RF channels to choose from to deal with RF interference and those are manually selected and then manually tuned to with a dial on the earphones like an old AM radio.  They us FM modulation, circa 60s.  This manual nature of the RF interfaces surprised me and is not something I would expect in even 25 year old electronics.<br />After 3 minutes of no audio input (e.g. turn off TV) a loud hiss/static commences on the headphones.  This means if you leave the headphone off the cradle and turn off the TV the headphone will hiss loudly until the battery dies.  The headphone should turn off as well....poor design.<br />The charging cradle is a bit awkward to use in that if the earpieces are not set for equal length, then the headphone will tilt to one side and the conductors in the headset band will not sit flat on metal bars (you can see the bars in the picture) and the batteries will not charge.<br />The ear pad foam is very light duty and I would not expect them to last 12 months with normal use and wear and tear.<br />There are no RCA adapters included.<br />The charging light stays lit even after charging is complete!<br />Its awkward to plug in the power adapter.  You almost need to used needle nose pliers as there is no room for fingers.<br />On occasion the tuner would detune and I would have to readjust the turning."
RQG1L27TCV5SW,4,Received Dec 2011 and now is Dec 2013. These work the same today as the day I received them. I use them maybe once a week so I have never had a problem with them not being charged. The max time I wear them is 3 to 4 hours. Battery has never died while wearing them. I do catch a little static from time to time but if I move my head a little it seems to go away.
R15C0DRRX2ZX6R,5,We really enjoy being able to hear the TV at different levels of sound.  We each can hear it at a confortable level.  Highly recommend them.
R1I62EJ1S6PVJV,2,Unfortunately I could not get the headphones to plug into the base.  Maybe this particular one was defective.  I returned it.
R1TIHBE1MTTRV0,5,sound is great and it was actually easy to set up.  Being electronically‎ challenged it was a relief to how easy to set up and is clear and nice all through my house
R2D4N5RP09G8RU,5,Such a wonderful tool to enjoy cinema at home. Solved our problems with different volumes for different people in the room.
R1FONHG1KJEI8E,4,Is a good device a little niose but nothing to regret. This brand is the best for me. Nice happy
R3DJR2E0P8MEVG,5,"It took me awhile to decide to get a wireless headset for TV and DVD viewing. I have had cheap ones before, and the experience was not a good one.  However, my wife likes to come up to the bedroom to read and I had to turn off the TV :(.  The Sennheiser Wireless RS120 RF wireless headphone system is the answer.  I can Mute the surround sound and still get full TV/DVD volume on my Sennheiser headset.  I can watch and she can read. What a concept.<br /><br />The sound quality is phenomenal.  I can even get great reception downstairs with the TV upstairs.  So if I go down for a snack or drink to bring up, I know exactly what is going on during my absence and can rewind if necessary.  I also love the convenience of the recharging stand on the Transmitter Assembly.  I strongly recommend you do NOT SETTLE for the non-rechargeable model (you have to change batteries) or any headset that is NOT RF - don't do the IR - your range and quality are very limited.  The Sennheiser is by far the best sound quality and its light weight is makes long TV viewing a breeze.  It also has 3 RF transmitter frequencies to overcome any interference.  I had no problems right our of the box.  Be sure to use the tuning wheel on the headset for the best stereo sound reception from your TV/DVD sound system.  Strongly recommend this unit.  I would not buy anything else.<br />Happy Sennheiser user in Clarkston, MI (4 inches of snow and 15 F right now...)"
RI8OQ3GC4KZ79,1,"I did buy one with order 105-6280133-5736214 , that sopped working after 4 - months. I liked its sound, its range of transmission as well as its appeareance, so I  thougth  that maybe my kids had damaged it, so I decided to buy a second one with order 107-1902290-9490621, but it also stopped working about 4 - 5 months after buying it by the same reason: It stopped transmitting.  After this, I took them to an expert and the conclusion was that  the component was chinese of the worst quality, and it couldn't be repaired.  I didn't returned them because I live out of USA, and the cost of returning would be as expensive as the value of the units  Don't ever buy one from this brand."
R3DNY2TW1C4JF5,5,"It's Christmas and the batteries were not included as stated in the information on amazon and the box. Don't know if it works or not.<br />Updated review.<br /><br />When amazon saw my original 3 star review, they contacted me to make right the missing rechargeable batteries. They did and the head phones work just as described. The tv is no longer blaring. Love the head set. Changed my rating from 3to5 stars. Thanks for the good service and follow up."
R341HC7FUYPC3K,3,Installation was simple. Sound is clear. Fidelity is average. You need to be careful when moving your head or they slide off.
R2OJOCXQN9MWMW,1,"I don't have a big head, but it's not small, either.  When wearing this headset while active around the house it invariably falls off with the slightest tilting of my head up or down.  Otherwise, no complaints.  I would love to return this headset for one that would remain in place when I am moving around.  How about it, Sennheiser?"
RM3UAHV2VGWVQ,4,So easy to plug it in and keep in a convenient location near TV and I used it a lot with my old tv.<br /><br />I gave a 4 ratings because I felt that price was good at that time and also I used it a lot.<br /><br />Cons: Volume is so low that after a while it was a bit of an effort to tune the headset to max volume.<br />I would have liked it more if vendor also includes a stereo jack (single jack split in two) as it currently only has 2 separate (red/white) jacks but many newer tv models and newer sound sources only offer single pin stereo out.
R2FIK2W7B3X8N7,3,"The sound from the headphones is fine, unless you're too far away from the source. The distance it was rated for is misleading because it starts to get static-y when you get more than 15 feet away from the receiver."
R1ZK0DS9M4IVM1,4,I purchased these headphones so I could watch tv while my wife read. It took awhile to figure out how to connect but I eventually succeeded. I needed to buy an AB switch so I could listen while using my Bluray player as well as HDTV. I am very pleased. Sound quality is very acceptable.
R1C173PNZ6EJQW,2,This unit's power cord would not keep proper contact to keep the base powered on.  The headphones did not set on the cradle well enough to make contact so they would charge.  I had to put a little weight to the top of the headphones so they would charge.  I've returned them.  Stay away from these!
R103P7B1KSG3MT,5,"My wife has hearing problem, She can understand more of TV sound than with hearing aids. Later bought hearing aids with transmitter direct to hearing aids. She some times uses this without hearing aids because the sound is better quality for her than through the hearing aids."
R1K5A7MHFTI593,5,My wife loves the wireless headphones. She can set her<br />program on the computer and move around and listen<br />to it.
R1KD7DBGHOYQUB,5,"I use it with SONY XBR4 TV<br />It works perfectly for me.<br />The sound is clear, the noise is low and only can be heard when walk out throughout the rooms."
R1BMEEQE0VDHQ8,4,"It can't not be worn during outdoor sports, 'cause the seat should be near the headphone.Suitable for indoor activites or enjoyment. My friend said the sound quality is good."
ROTHNKHJTN2IW,1,I was going to buy the TV ears and the guy at radio shack said these were better! After trying for 3 hours to figure our what they hooked to on my TV I gave up! My TV is a vizio and has all hook ups but nothing would work with these stinkin headphones!  I am hard of hearing and very mad! I took them back and got my money back and will not go to Radio Shack EVER AGAIN!
R2R2JRTXTVKEE3,2,It was not what I was looking for'  It did not work on my tv; nor the tv in the living room.  I have returned it.  Maybe next time.<br />  Thanks
RRIRL2YOS58YS,4,"I am giving these headphones 4 stars because the foam ear pads are not too comfortable. Hopefully they will soften over time. I had an old set of Sharper Image pieces that I used for years with ear pads that were soft as a babies bottom. Another (-) for me but not sooo important is that you can't disconnect the RCA cable from the base. That made routing the cable a bit more of a task as I need all my cords hidden, and they pass through holes to accomplish this.<br /><br />When I say these are &#34;clear&#34; I mean for the purpose of listening to TV at night, which is my primary use for this set. There is no noticeable hiss when tuned correctly. I would think that they would be equally suited for music audio as well.  Another thing: they tuned in right away. The tune dial is a bit close to the volume, but not enough for me to worry.  If these had a softer set of ear pads that also cupped over the ears, I would have given them 5 stars."
R1L9Z3ED2L8OBF,4,Its quite comfortable to use. the pads on speakers is quite soft and its very light;you wont know that u are wearing anything. The only drawback is that you can hear a hiss sometimes specially in quite passages. It does not go fully even after tuning. Its range is also from TV to Sofa. Thats it. It starts making static sound when you try to go to the door of the room.<br />Beside than that its a good product.
R2NWFLUF80Z96V,2,"great if you have a large head, but for me it was not, the phones keep falling of your head if you look down, extra star for good sound"
R39O55DF10FIXN,5,OUTSTANDING! They do exactly what we wanted them to do. TV is now clear; no more &#34;What did he say?&#34;
R3DYFN7SQYSGZI,4,"I have defective hearing, but my wife can hear an ant crawling.  So, I purchased this item for listening to TV in the same location with my wife. Some negative comments concern either static or voice delay. I would like to address those concerns.  I connected the Red plug from the charging unit  to the Red Audio Out receptacle of my DVD-TV box.  I then plugged the Black plug to the other (mine was White) Audio Out receptacle of the DVD box. There is a short 3 second delay before the sound occurs.  If static is heard, rotate the Tune dial until the sound is clear. Mine is perfect. There is also a three slot switch at the front base of the charger. If the sound has only static, you can switch one of those options back and forth , while rotating the Tune dial, until clear sounds are heard.  Don't forget to turn the Volume dial up half way.  I listened for sounds Before placing the phones on my head.  Voices and music are Krystal Klear (no sound delay).  In addition, I can turn the audio volume of my TV to Mute, and still hear sounds through the headphones. I can also hear external sounds (wife, phone, etc.) while still hearing TV. I can also walk around my entire home and still hear the TV without ant distortion.  The price was right...my life is better."
R1BYX878GXDU5T,3,Head phones fall off my head with any movement. Fit is not at all tight around the ears. It inexplicably has static that can only be controlled by increasing volume on the TV or radio. Hurts my  poor husband's poor bald head after long term use. Am thinking about returning if there is better option.
R29KL3K8GVPERH,4,"I got these for Christmas last year and after heavy use, I think they are great for the price. The range is excellent, battery life is much longer than i expected (rechargable on the stand), and they have decent bass response. If they don't receive a signal for a set time, they automatically disconnect from the source and you just hear static. By signal, I mean any sounds that would normally be audible through speakers. For example, if you're watching a movie and there is suddenly a part with a minute of silence, you will get the static. It would be nice if they self muted, or turned off entirely, instead of hitting you with a barrage of white noise, but a mindful user can simply turn them off if/when they are expecting extended silence. (The light on the base unit will light up when there is a useable signal)<br /><br />Some users complain about interference, hiss, etc, but I find that this only happens when passing through a strong enough field that disrupts the RF signal. When using analog equipment such as this, this is to be expected.<br />Bottom line, as long as you are aware of how RF headphones work, their limitations, as well as understanding that smartphone activity affects speakers/amplifiers, these are great for the price."
R2EKU0287VWOB4,4,The headset blocks out noise and the range is surprisingly good. My husband takes them outside and they work fine.
R39P47V2PNPGU4,5,"Bought these for my Father-in-Law.  He can't watch TV or a movie for 0.0001 seconds before his wife starts nagging him about everything in known existence.  I think these definitely prevented a homicide.  Now, he can wear these and drown out the headache.  So far, the best gift in his life.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, no hissing or popping.  Will not work with all TV's.  Make sure you have the right connections."
R2E2029JZC3IPG,4,2nd set I bought RF feature excellent good sound wish headphones more comfortable but excellent product for price would buy again
R1FE0BYQTT2CE1,5,Sennheiser is top quality. You can not get a better product. They are top quality and I have used the name quite often.
R10YR09YB9Y66B,5,"These are very comfortable and have awesome sound quality. They were in, like new condition and they are so easy to just hang on cradle and charge while not in use. I would highly recommend these headphones."
RCSSRHWXA4RTS,5,I bought these for my father with hearing aids.  He needed something to use primarily at night to keep volume levels down.  We have tried several different types of headphones over the years mostly with disappointing results.  He needed something wireless and &#34;on the ear&#34; vs. over the ear models which are very hot.  He loves these.  They clarity and volume levels are great and highly recommends these.
R1SASF7QFO0YXN,5,My husband now uses the headphones whenever he watches television.  He usually needed the volume louder than I did so this product really helps.
R2VWT64W1OLW5U,5,"My third RS120 headset! Love Sennheiser's products ... good quality, and they hold up as advertised. Price is good when the quality is considered - you always get what you pay for."
R1V6P3ABVGIE0P,3,"Other reviewers have cited my own annoyances with these RF headphones:<br /><br />1) Static - Short bursts of static at irregular intervals, roughly once every minute or two, just barely too long to be considered a &#34;click.&#34; These pops are annoying as heck when listening to music, but less so when watching TV where the storyline and action soundtrack are distraction enough that I don't notice the pops.<br /><br />2) Loose headband - The loose headband makes them really comfortable, but only when sitting or standing upright. Be ready to hold them onto your head if you have to over to pick up a dropped remote control.<br /><br />3) Auto power-off - This is really annoying if I have to pause a movie for a couple minutes and leave the headset on, because after a couple minutes the base unit will auto-off and the headphones will start blaring static into my ears. Why on earth does the AC-powered base unit auto-off an not the battery powered headphones?<br /><br />4) Distortion - Even when run from a line-level output, the low end distorts if you turn them up. They're nice and clear at normal listening volume but if you crank them up, they'll break up.<br /><br />5) Annoying low frequency gating - If your listening source contains percussive low frequencies, i.e. explosions, crashes, pumping bass, etc., these phones will attempt to mask their abysmal low frequency performance by automatically cutting the output volume when those sounds are present, resulting in a sound that subtlety phases in and out. This is most annoying when listening to music, but easy to ignore when watching TV.<br /><br />Still, considering that top-of-the line wireless headphones are running $400+, maybe these are reasonable compromises. I do really enjoy listening to movies through these headphones, they have a much longer range and will get quite a bit louder than my Bluetooth headphones and, for my non-Bluetooth equipment (TV/Stereo), RF phones are my only choice. Since I don't know thatI'd get better performance from anything else in this price range, I'll keep them for TV watching, and use my better-sounding Bluetooth headphones for listening to music on my computer and mobile devices."
R1UL7OIO6YJSK8,5,"These headohones are absolutely the greatest !!!!  They are lightweight; you can wear them for hours without any discomfort at all.  The sound is well beyond my expectations, with solid base and accurate mids and highs.  The reception is, again, beyond my expectations;  I can wear them almost anywhere in our house and get a clear signal.  Great sound, very comfortable, great reception; these are the best you can buy, you will not regret buying these.<br />The only slight inconvenience is when you mute the source, after a minute or two, you get a loud static sound, so you will need to hit the switch on the headphones to mute the source.  A very minor inconvenience but takes a little getting used to, if you use the mute as much as I do.  So far the headphone switch shows no signs of complaint.<br />Again, great headphones, you will not be disappointed !"
R2I3X5IAV63D9Q,4,so far this headset works great.  Sound quality is excellent and headset is comfortable.  very easy to charge just have to place it on the stand.
R28AKUEYVW0MGY,2,"Pro:<br />The sound of these headphones is pretty good, when it works.<br /><br />Con:<br />The fit is, just off. They are bulky, and the earpieces are completely flat, so they done conform to your ear at all. They also sit at an odd angle against your ear, so are not at all comfortable.<br /><br />Sounds cuts out all the time, chirps, or gets static from signal interference. I tried all the various options for tuning them to different channels, but had the same results no matter how it was tuned.<br /><br />&#34;Power saving&#34; feature causes the base to cut out, but then the headphones just blare static. I used these with my computer (gaming laptop) in order to not bug other family members, so there are sometimes periods of time when there is silence while I read something or am between tasks. For some reason they set it so the base unit would 'go to sleep' before the headphones do, and every time this happens the signal to the headphones is cut. When that happens the headphones just play static, loudly.<br /><br />I would have returned these, but waited too long and amazon wont take them. So they are currently an $80 paperweight."
R2STAXYIONQI1T,5,"For anyone who is hard of hearing, and tired of catching only part of the audio on their TV, this is the item to buy. I love these headphones. They are comfortable and, most awesome, cordless. I have worn them for 3 or 4 hours (I confess!) without them bothering my ears. This company makes great audio products! My son-in-law told me about them."
R3TOQ5X84AI1AQ,3,I haven't found the right set of wireless headphones yet.  These have perhaps the best sound - good bass as well a treble - but are still a bit clunky.  Just fine for short sessions but not comfortable enough to listen with for more than 30 minutes or so.
RH9IV99TZHHRJ,5,"Has excellent sound, works anywhere in the house, easy to hook to television.  Plus the price was right when on sale."
R36U8OARNGILAB,5,I can hear each word clearly without having the television so loud that my wife wants to leave the room.
R2B2Q0TYR4DIQU,1,"I ordered this as a gift to my Mother for her birthday.  After an hour of my brother trying to get it to work and 24 hours of charging it, it never did.  The cord did not seat in the outlet and the light never came on.  All they got was static.  I'm returning it. Very disappointed."
RMZ8HWQJL75RB,4,"I rarely write a review on a purchase but felt compelled to with the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones. After charging the recommended 24 hours, I still had very little reception and thought these were headed back to Amazon. I read through many reviews and searched the net looking for a fix. I finally found a video on youtube by Sennheiser showing that I needed a digital audio to analog converter (DAC). I purchased one at RadioShack and hooked it up to my HD-DVR box. As soon as I turned on the headphones, I had crystal clear reception. I can go anywhere inside and outside the house and hear no static or distortion.<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars if the information about the need for the DAC was included in the instruction booklet. If you are hooking these up to digital output, you will need the DAC and a cable. Hope this helps some of you."
R2GVT9KJT61XN2,1,"After doing my due diligence to find a set of tv headphones, I settled on this make and model. My hearing is not so good anymore, and my wife complains the tv is too loud.  It was with anticipation that I opened the package an proceeded to plug in the transmitter. Nothing. No lights, sounds, bells, whistles, nothing. I tried multiple different connections, referred to the manual, and still, nothing. Enough of that. I repackaged the unit and returned it to Amazon the next day.  I am sure I could have gotten an exchange for another model, but, based on my experience, this was too foreboding.  One time, shame on you. Two times,  shame on me."
R1P5DUCEUFRX1W,5,"I have 3 of these, one for my house, one for my weekend cottage and one for backup.<br />The oldest one is 3 years old and still works great.  I use these to watch TV while my<br />wife is asleep or on the computer at our one room lake cottage.  Sometimes I just use<br />them to be able to hear better. (68 years old). A quality product."
R1DAD5R5N3DY86,4,"Can't go wrong with Sennheiser.  Like the rechargability, distance is sufficient.  Has some static if not tuned in exactly right.  Allows wife to sleep while i can still watch tv."
R31B3TLLYN1C5U,5,"I bought them for my father who is hard of hearing and always had to have the tv up loud, now he can hear with a normal level."
R358DWHMO08OM2,5,"I bought this headphone after reading the bad and the good reviews. I was very skeptic.  But since there weren't that many choices and the price was reasonable, I decided to buy it. Guess what, I love it!!!!  No static as many reviews I read.  It is perfect in all of the aspects.  Fits well on the head/ears.  No static.  Charges well.  Even when I went downstairs from my bedroom, I still had a very good reception.  I totally recommend this product."
R39TX4MQSZGR5U,5,"These have good fidelity and fit comfortably. The range is good. Sometimes the charging light just goes out even when headphones are properly placed on the charger. But, holds good charge lasting for several hours. Good craftsmanship and good value at Amazon."
R1BQAR2Y5L4M72,4,"The headphones are fine and deliver the sound very well. The set I had previously, had a sound level control for each ear separate. Since I am a bit deaf on one ear, the separation was very convenient."
R1NENW490Q15NE,5,"Superior quality wireless headphones that provide great stereo sound.  These are a little large and do not provide the best ability to stay in place, but still a good value."
R50W3MSGCAAVB,3,"If your head is smaller than a pumpkin, you may have trouble in keeping this product on your head.  I cannot do housework w/o these phones falling off my head."
R3T9LHCZQE25S0,3,"Like children, when it works it is &#34;very, very good&#34;; but when it doesn't seat easily on charging cradle or stay tunned, it is &#34;very, very bad&#34;"
R391CSQ00LGBJN,5,I got these for my husband and he liked them so much that I ordered a second set for my father-in-law.  Both are hard of hearing and are amazed at how much they were missing before - even with hearing aids!  Very Comfortable.
RF5ZSXGATIS93,4,These headphones are very nice. Just like advertised. No problems. Good range. Batteries last along time. Sound excellent. Very good buy.<br /> Thank
R2TYR788XXNPV,5,"I love these headphones. Setup was simple.  It took me a minute to figure out the tuning but once they were dialed in the sound is wonderful.  I have the transmitter set up in the back of my house next to TV and I am able to walk about 100 ft away (the farthest point I can in the house) without any discernible loss in audio quality.  That surprised me because some reviews complained about static as they moved away from the base.<br /><br />As far as fit is concerned, they are a bit on the loose side but that is ok with me since I will primarily be using them for late night TV watching and gaming.<br /><br />Totally satisfied with the purchase, highly recommended."
R1JO538OO3E35W,2,"My problem with the headphones was not their quality when they were &#34;alive&#34;. The problem is that they &#34;died&#34; after approximately 3 years of light use. When I spoke with the U.S. factory representative, he indicated that 3 or 4 years is the useful life for these headphones. He offered no advice or factory remedy other than to purchase another pair.To spend what they cost for 3 + years of light use is not what I believe is satisfactory, thus my low rating."
R3DT7LH28422ET,3,"The headphones sounded OK. I could hear a slight hiss.<br />I play the drums & the headphones just didn't have the volumn to give me clear music over all the racket I make on the drums.<br />I appreciate your return policy, thanks!"
R3TU811K3FP8MA,5,works very well with my SONY TV. No static. Good sound quality and excellent range. Be sure to have your speakers set to audio out as: Fixed. It will allow the headphones to operate with the volume control on the headphones.
R13G8RXNQ0N7ZW,5,"Love these! This set was actually for a cousin of mine, also had to buy one for a friend from church! They tried mine and liked them very much, had to have them!"
R14HEOIHT9NXAM,3,The unit works ok and was easy to set up and operate.  I am not in love with the sound quality however.  Seems somehow muted or muffled to me.  I had been using the Sony headset before and the sound quality was much better.  Other than that this item is just ok and works as advertized.
R23K465K9AZELW,5,These headphones give the best sound.  They are working great.  My husband wears them because he needs the TV louder than I do.  I also use them when I want to listen to a program or movie and he wants to read.  Works great!
R1HHKO3F9HT9HK,4,"Excellent sound quality, strong signal even 50 feet from the base, but ear pads could be better, and static noise should be shut off automatically. For instance, if I turn them on, until there's some sound coming in out of my laptop (which the base is connected to), you hear some loud static noise until the music comes in."
R368PZW2J5PR92,4,"I've had it a month.  It does what I expected.  It has occasional bursts of static.  Earphones are comfortable, but a little bulky."
R1EDN232YLKTRU,2,I wasn't aware that this unit had a different frequency than the one I bought years ago. Found out later that it is a European version. I can still use it but wish it was identical to the earlier one....
RRC7VQG7ZT8YI,5,"These are the answer to my prayers. Now, my husband can watch whatever he wants and I can read or watch my own program via computer without retiring to another room. My husband would probably not admit to having reduced hearing capacity, but I was always asking him to turn the TV down. Not being much of a TV watcher, myself, I was getting increasingly annoyed by it. He loves them, probably because he can hear better. Had no problems in setting them up to our TV. He finds them comfortable and can walk around the house and not miss a beat of his favorite programs. Great purchase."
R1E2SCZK7YO7GA,5,Little larger charging base than it appeared.  But these work beautifully.  I had no trouble installing.  Distance for good quality sound is acceptional.
R2WTC62F8E9YOT,4,"A little static sometimes, but that is better than listening to the loud music downstairs for a couple hours every night!"
R2DB6TYKIYBNWO,3,"Audio quality varies from very good to terrible. Moving just a little bit can cause scratchy audio. They kinda hurt if you wear them for an hour or two. Overall, they're decent. I just picked up the LG TONE Bluetooth headphones and they seem to be better."
R2HUOOTYX0HR8T,1,Could not get this headphone to work at all with my computer.  I'm just writing this last sentence to get to the required length.
R1AJANG3M5G6YX,3,These were sort of cheap but worked ok.  Static became a problem that was hard to get rid of and started driving me crazy.
R24LG5I24Y3I9X,1,it doesn't work. i'm returning it. it was refurbished but obviously not tested after it left the shop. i would give it no stars if that were possible.
RDKY93HF76YSL,1,"Well, I like the headphones except for one major thing.  The base station auto shuts off when you mute the sound, pause a video, or if the show you are watching goes quiet for a minute.  This causes an incredibly loud hissing noise to shoot through the headset.  It will scare the snot out of you!  My ears are still ringing.  Unfortunately, there is no way to turn this &#34;feature&#34; off so I am returning the headphones as I am actually scared to wear them now."
R3KY7YIM554X7J,5,"Bought them for my great grandma, so loves them. She is able to sit in the kitchen and listen to the news from the living room. They works through the walls perfectly and have a clear sound."
R3JW9WP4476TB9,5,"Why didn't I buy this sooner? I use it for watching TV from across the room. Excellent sound quality, much better than listening to my TV speakers. The ability to adjust frequency tuning and volume on the headset is a plus. Very comfortable on the ears (mine stick out a bit) and well padded. And my kids will use it with no complaints. Highly recommended."
R2NIV5SR1Q91UL,1,maybe I got a bum pair but early on got sulfuric acid in the battery casing.  Would brush out and ensure clean and dry and again happened with next set of batteries.  battery life progressively shortened and eventually threw them out. Got the Sennheiser  RS180 instead- much better so far and way superior sound for not that much more.
R2FMUHOS1V19CV,5,"Works like a charm... easy to install no noise on the headset signal... Highly Recommend !  Good Price, shipped fast... I love it !!!!"
R2YII4W1JO659Y,2,"From a technical standpoint these headphones seem fine.  The sound quality is good, the build quality is solid, packaging was very thoughtful. The issue that I have is that the earpads are flat and feel hard when pressed against my ears.  Since I wear glasses, after a couple of hours of wearing the headphones and the glasses on the pressure of earpads against my glasses makes my head hurt to the point that I need to take the headphones off.  My wife said the same thing.  Even if you do not wear the glasses, the earpads still feel flat, hard and you can sense the pressure on your ears, something that I did not experience with my prior set from another brand.  I will be returning this set and pay more attention to the shape of the earpads on the replacement set.<br /><br />An update. After more research I decided to go with Sony MDR-IF245RK which is very similar to what we used to have. What I like about this Sony model is that they are very light and I did not have the problem of the ear cups pushing against my ears and my glasses. Since we will be using it for the bedroom TV watching only, it does not bother me that the cradle needs to be in the direct view."
R1MGNPL6408F3F,5,"After reading the reviews, I bought these wireless headphones several years ago when their price was lower than its $90 it is today (12/08/2013).  I wanted these headphones so my wife and I could listen to TV programs without disturbing our our sons while they did their homework.  We bought a pair and plugged their inputs into the audio output jacks on the back of the cable box.  All that was required after that was to mute the audio on the TV whenever we wanted to listen without distracting our kids.<br /><br />The headsets use NiCad batteries.  The batteries recharge any time the headset is resting on the base unit's wire support frame.  Status LEDs will tell you when they are correctly positioned for charging.  After about 3 years of use we did have to replace one set of batteries but they are generic AAA cells that you can buy anywhere.  The headphones have a very good reception range and I can state that they work up to at least 50 feet from the base when used in a wooden structure.<br /><br />If you want to use these to listen to music, I am sure they will provide an adequate sound but they were probably not designed to provide the same quality of listening experience you will have with high-end, wired audio headphones.<br /><br />I do not hesitate to recommend these."
R20ECCH8U2O4J2,3,"I recently purchased these Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones so that I could enjoy some TV in the evenings while my wife prefers to read.  This allows us to spend time next to each other without one of us bothering the other with the noise of the television.<br /><br />This version of the headphones was a bit of a challenge to set up given the sound outputs available on my TV and home theater.<br /><br />While watching TV there are noticeable crackles and pops in the sound.  There is also a small but persistent hiss that, despite fine tuning the device, doesn't go away.<br /><br />Overall, I like the product and am glad that I have it.  I was a little disappointed in the sound quality given the price.  I guess you really have to fork out to get a pure, clear sound on a wireless device like this."
RPQ8QWZ3UJVAB,5,"A marriage saver.  My husband blasts the TV and now he can without invading my quite.  Plus, the sound is excellent and he said they are very comfortable."
RQ05I36HC62S8,5,"These are the best wireless headphones for the price. While they might not look as good as the Sony MDR-RF985RK (comparable price), they blow it out of the water in terms of sound quality and lack of static."
R233G63WIXWNR0,5,"Actually my Daddy loves it, so I love it too.<br />Bought these for my Daddy's room when he visits.  He likes to stay up late and watch TV, but would keep it turned down so low he couldn't really hear the sound well.  He didn't want to keep anyone awake.  He loves these so much he stays up much longer than he use to watching TV.<br />Now that I think about it, he's been sleeping in a lot later too instead of being with us during his visits.<br />Hmmmm . . . maybe I SHOULDN'T have ordered these after all.  Just kidding, they really do work great, easy to use, sound quality is great.  Really glad we purchased these!"
R12CFB93HCJQCA,3,"Does the job that its suppose to do just not the best. Still hear some feedback from the transmission.  The sound could be a lot better.  That's the only reason for 3 stars.  It is simple to get working, and enjoying, but when its time to upgrade think i will spend the extra 40 bucks and get better headphones."
R3HY8AH2TN3TAM,5,"Living in a two bedroom apartment with an child who needs to go to bed early, and me who loves to stay up later watching things, this is ESSENTIAL for our home. It is worth every penny. I've had it for a long while and I don't see it malfunctioning or acting strange in any way. The wireless function is fantastic, and the tuning is great--never had to deal with &#34;fuzzy&#34; sounds, and the sound is CRISP."
R2YGR4AM8MA1JX,5,I've got two pair and they just work fine. Never a problem with them and the sound quality is excellent.
R11DTI9OAYKR3C,5,"I purchased this item December 26, 2008.  I use it regularly at the computer and it works great.  If I walk around the house (two stories) it will get fuzzy in some spots and clear up in others.  They are a little heavy so not great for a lot of moving around.<br /><br />I find the sound quality to be quite good.  I would buy these again but I hope I won't have to anytime soon."
RBDO7HNC49CEZ,4,Works fine so far comfortable and clear sound. Can be hooked up in multiple ways to the cable/TV boxes. No complaints.
R2NQZQHZLNA3LE,5,"This was a great buy. Being that we cannot have a sound system in our aprtment, we decided to pick these up.  We constantly use to block out outside sounds. The headphones are super compfortable as well."
R14PNUM7EL4Y1H,2,"Nope.  Not gonna solve your problems.  This will not help you watch TV or use your computer while your friend/family/significant other is in the room and is complaining about the noise.<br /><br />There is a hiss that is super annoying and the audio is not good.  The headphones do not &#34;hug&#34; your ears and feel pretty cheap.<br /><br />I &#34;used&#34; them once.  Left them plugged in for a few months and just threw them out when they were just cluttering up space.  An item like this is basically &#34;good enough&#34; for general purpose use or isn't.  If it isn't, its not worth the purchase.  In my opinion, this product does not make the cut."
RTCVXKB3JA68Y,5,"These are FANTASTIC.  Once we bought a pair for ourselves, we ended up buying sets for both of our parents (both hard of hearing) as well.  They are wonderful.  I use them when I use our elliptical so I don't have to blast the volume to hear it over the fan.  You can walk from room to room and hear the TV perfectly.  They are comfortable, and the best part is that they recharge on the set."
R1S38OSG0T834E,5,"I waited a while to review these headphones to see how well that I liked them. They are awesome headphones and I can go to any room in the house including the basement and still hear what is going on. My wife like to sleep late, so when I get up I don't want to disturb her, so I sit back with these on in my recliner and enjoy the shows that I want to watch without waking her up. This is why I bought them in the first place, because my wife would complain that she could hear the TV."
R2MHOV4UJOPNJG,5,"Headphones provide excellent clarity, the rechargable element is great and they are comfortable to wear.  Mostly used before bedtime so spouse can sleep."
RA295V0Q0RVII,2,"Bought these for husband who is somewhat hard of hearing.  Not the products fault, but he doesn't use them as he blocks out all other sounds.  (Teenage daughters sneaking up on him, doorbell ringing, etc)"
RXLQU65G7NK4A,4,Easy to put on the stand. We have had other brands and it was a pain to try and get them on the stand correctly. The only thing I don't like is the control buttons are always too small and the color is black . My husband and I are in our late 60's and have a hard time seeing things black. Of coarse everything seems to be black and small:) Sound is good. I would recommend this product.. Don't know why companies don't make their products white with black lettering????
R2VZNDJ14XH9C8,5,We have a old set of these and they have shown to be very dependable. The new set is a Christmas present and have not been used yet.
R2BU7KZ2OO724W,5,"I bought these for my husband for his birthday and he told me that they are the best set of headphones he has ever owned for the price, which is reasonable, and he likes them so much he uses them every day!"
R3MRVWKSSXP5Q7,4,"I purchased the RS120 and find the sound excellent as I am very hearing deficient, left ear barley able to hear, right ear is my source of sound reception, I didn't receive an instruction booklet and am wondering how to exchange the rechargeable batteries when they become too worn to be recharged? Are the batteries in left or right ear pad? How are the removal and replacement done? , email robertfikes83@gmail.com, please let me know as I am thinking about another RS120 for standby, thank you. I had Sony headphones but replacement batteries were too expensive, rechargeable batteries are much cheaper, Sony's were nearly $100.00, I could purchase a new complete set for a little more. Robert Fikes"
R7FUSQ3WAJGE6,5,Purchased these for my 96 year old mother who was having great difficulty hearing her television. She is absolutely ecstatic about them; she can now comfortable watch a movie on television and hears everything that is going on. I had no problem setting these up for her.
R98R6NQTRLFCH,5,Easy to set up if you read the directions. The sound is better than the built-in TV speakers. Initial battery charge takes 24 hours.
R1RJXOTLM5QPD9,5,"These work perfectly! Sound quality is GREAT! No troubles so far, comfortable fit, sounds like a movie theater!!!!! Highly recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE: Use these every day, think we've had em for almost two years, NO problems, sound is GREAT, perfect for us! Don't understand the other less than five star evaluations, these have been just great for us. The volume is louder than we need, there is an easy adjustment dial if you get poor reception/static, always has worked to 'tune them in', no hiss, perfect sound. No battery issues, they recharge on the stand, work for days when not on the charger, but we nearly always just store them on the charger. Highly recommend these, I'm getting another set for the bedroom TV so we can use them on different channels."
R1OHS1PNXHZHTU,1,Ordered this for my wife. Very difficult to program.and not user friendly.  Directions are useless. Very unreliable. Disappointed with this product.
R8YLOR84ERH9N,5,I bought it for my husband who is an airforce veteran and has lost 40 % of his hearing. He is able to listen to TV without turning up the volume. He says greater than swiss cheese.
RKS9P5KBZNBPX,2,I bought these in 2011 and they were really great at first.  About a year later the right earphone started cutting out when I adjusted the volume.  The problem has continued to get worse.  now looking for something else.
RFGODUZPQCYAR,5,Referral from son suggesting that Sennheiser would be a better buy than TV Ears. Actually cost less than TV Ears and the quality is far superior.
RRW1RMGJUHJMN,5,"Love it, love it, love it! We purchased this item as my boyfriend loves playing video games and watching movies and our sound system does provide a lot of volume/bass/etc. Our neighbors started complaining on a weekly basis, which was too much - we do like entertaining ourselves but not at the expense of other people.<br /><br />After doing a little research we decided to purchase this model. Price was great (about $60 when we purchased these) and shipping was fast. While it took me a while to set these up (we have a Sony home theater system, so lots of cables to deal with) I haven't had any problems ever since! I don't believe I even had to replace the batteries since I've purchased them. Volume is great and right now I can hear my boyfriend next to me playing Call of Duty - I can hear some sound while he's using the headphones, which doesn't bother me at all. And he is THRILLED!<br /><br />It has been over an year since we've purchased this product and I came to find out Sennheiser are a leader in the field of audio. In our experience this is a great product and we do recommend it."
R2KVSHR26HLC5Y,4,"the sound is very clear. Now I don't have to listen to wife bitching that the TV is to loud.<br />  they could stand to be a little tighter on your head. they slide off when i try to do things in the kitchen. when you turn your head down they slide down,but sitting in chair they are great."
R1F5AKGPQ7T5O9,5,My husband has had a hearing problem since forever and this has made him so happy.  The sound is excellent and he enjoys the fact that he can still hear as he goes from room to room.  This makes for a much quieter house so that I can listen to my television at a normal level.  Wish I had know of this years ago. Fantastic item.  I feel as though it is of the best quality.
R1A3DOEWNX89B3,2,"Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear 926MHz RF Headphones with Charging Cradle<br /><br />As wireless headphones go this one was quite pricey.  The control or wiring of the headphone seems to have a bad contact and, at times, cuts off entirely.  The tuning control is extremely problematic, is very hard to adjust and once adjusted occasionally will fail requiring readjustment.  The charging system is so sensitive that when the headset is properly contacting the charging contacts it fails for no reason.<br /><br />I may find it necessary to return it.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Ralph W. Palmer"
R2APPBVDAL42VQ,3,Very good sound quality.  So nice to use these so I don't disturb my family while watching TV.  Only negative is that they tend to &#34;stretch out&#34; in less than a year and then fall off your head.  Manufacturer replaced them at no charge due to this problem.  But it's an issue they need to improve.
R3BYP5KII4IIM0,5,This is my second Sennheiser. My first one purchased 3 years ago still works fine and my new one receives the streaming also  from the old base which makes it very handy when my wife and I wand to listen TV in the same room while the other base is in the other room.Sound quality is outstanding.
R6IOFOBCTHV5B,1,"The headphones get too warm, and they're flat, not very comfortable. Sound isn't great, either. Much prefer the Auvio brand."
R3JXKTXMIKPM0L,5,"I'm a little hard of hearing and my neighbor down stairs would regularly knock on my door around 10 pm, asking me to turn the tv down. Thought I would try these, as I already had Sennheiser wired phones I use for music and movies on my pc. Once I played with the tuning a bit, found them to be fine. No hiss, very rarely any interference at all. Watching football and popping into the kitchen (or bathroom) without missing anything. Think I'll order another set tonight and hook them to my PS2 or the 50&#34; Sony it's wired to. The hiss I've seen in the customer complaints I've seen here are either a local problem, or you didn't tweak the tuning enough. Mine work fine. * Just thought I'd add that I've had these for nearly four years now and they still work fine."
R3Q6Y5MQN5683Y,5,"Worked like advertised, fit well. Look good without being too large or sliding around your head as you change you position."
R34P8LQRGM26R6,5,dad had a set of these before. great headphones they work well dad had the first set for 3 years and abused them . I would recommend . I actually contacted Sennhieser . no problems with the person on the phone .
R8QKQY124Y9F4,5,"Bought this in 2009! It is still working great and I use it every night when everyone else in the house has gone to bed. I think i have changed the batteries once. Sound quality is great and I cannot wait to hook it up the new Samsung TV I just bought on Amazon. In my opinion this is a must have accessory for a big screen TV purchase.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal on a 50\\"" TV too after searching all week.<br />[[ASIN:B0074FGLUM B0074FGLUM]]"
R3FTLPUVKSEDQA,2,"Purchased this in August 2011.  It worked pretty well -- some hiss and the occasional loud pop, but usually it was good sound.  But today, three months past the 2 year warranty, it just died.  It still charges the headsets, but no matter what input I plug it into, it doesn't broadcast any sound!  I'm kind of screwed -- I have two headsets already;  if I change brands I'll have to buy the extra headset; if I buy another one of these I'll have a headset I don't need and a worry that two years and three months from now...kaput again."
R2TEBKYHO3XLFX,2,"Buzz, Hiss, too much messing around to get them to work right...Just OK but certainly not great...and not that comfortable."
RVOYPBW6M1L5I,5,"Very nice with excellent sound.  Actually, my father in law liked it so much that we ordered one for him.  Helps when your hearing is not as good as it used to be."
R33935PU9TBBJO,5,"Sound is equal to that from my Sennheiser wired earphones, while convenience is muck greater.  Yes, the phones are heavier and warmer than my foldable, portable set, and yes, my fingers can get the tuning control and volume contyrol mixed up some times.  But now there is no wire to trip over or manipulate.  This set is excellent for the price."
R2ZAMDABW03NWQ,5,Best purchase ever! My man can watch whatever crap on tv he wants and I don't have to listen to it.  He loves them too.
R35ADSODD8OG4H,1,"Works, then doesn't work, then works, then doesn't work.<br />I've tried to apply suggestions, but still doesn't work as expected"
R2GQD5FHZIJXYC,5,"I have one of the very first wireless headphones ever made (still works!) but they are very uncomfortable and heavy. Looking for a replacement, I settled on these and am very happy I did.<br /><br />These are so lightweight you can barely feel them and they don't crush your ears to the sides of your head. At first there was a hiss but when I turned that magical TUNE dial, it went away.  Oh my goodness, could that be the solution for the bad reviewers?! Some people amaze me, really.<br /><br />I needed a solution for a wireless set up for my LED tv which only has a digital audio output. I also purchased a FiiO D3 digital to analog converter with a toslink cable. The outputs on the converter match up with the Sennheiser audio cables for stereo sound. Crystal clear.<br /><br />Highly recommend for casual use. There's a reason why Sennheiser has $300 headphones. If you're some kind of audio snob, then I suggest you purchase those if you can't be bothered to adjust a little dial."
R1HFCS3TU0UD9I,5,"If you are a bit hard of hearing, this is clearest sounding head set you will ever need, a quality product."
R2C6GDJDZI9ZA9,5,I use these at work. It's kind of nice to be able to listen to whatever it is that you're listening to without disturbing others. It's even better when you can do it without being tethered to your desk.
R1WO9KKJ0YHFZ9,5,"My husband is hard of hearing, and to prevent me from going deaf from his TV volume, I bought him these headphones. They are perfect for our purposes. No problem getting them charged and set up. He can hear, and my ears don't bleed from the TV volume, so we're both happy. One thing to note is that they have to sit precisely right on the charging rack or they won't be charged. Make sure the light comes on when you place them back in the rack."
R17M2PPKNHZG3R,5,"This has saved my marriage. My spouse like to watch a lot of TV, and I like quiet or music. With this, she can listen to the TV, and I can listen to my music, or nothing. EDIT: These worked fine for two years and a day (just past the warranty) and then just quit. But they were great while they lasted!"
R1PSTF3VFPHOP1,2,"They stopped working after 2 years and they were not getting much use. They did not compare to the sound quality of my previous over the ear JVC brand. They are not quite over the ear, they sit on the ears. The sound quality could be better. I would not attempt to pay more for a more costly model of this brand. This is a product that you would want to hear and compare before buying."
R39WJ8I5J3KIFP,5,"My wife and I sometimes watch TV and movies in bed and now we can do so without the dog barking at certain noises in those shows, waking the baby across the hall, and generally ruining our evening! Other times one of us can watch a show the other just isn't into - without disturbing each other! These things are great! We picked up this transmitter base + headphone set and an additional headphone. That you can add as many extra headphones you might want is a nice perk.<br /><br />The battery life is surprisingly good, the included rechargables can be quickly replaced with regular AAA's in a pinch (when I forget to recharge mine), and they're very comfortable to wear for hours (my wife will fall asleep still wearing hers). They feel well built, too (see prior comment). The sound quality is quite good for what they are - and as a bit of an audiophile, that's saying something.<br /><br />My only compaint is the analog tuning means there are occassional dropouts and noises - even moving my head an inch or so will sometimes briefly fuzz or interrupt the sound. But it's pretty minor and the convenience and peace of enjoyment these afford us is well worth it."
R2TPH8TNKHHWSO,2,Doesn't meet expectations.  We took the earphones to Radio Shack for evaluation as couldn't plug into the TV.  They felt we had received a European version and sold us a cable to enable us to access the TV.  We could now plug in but still the audio is less than expected and less than our set at our summer home.  What do you think?
R377H8YJ7MD555,5,Bought this to replace a similar item that used batteries to power the headphones.  Much better sound and we wont be spending anymore money on batteries.  Win-win.  We have peace in the house once again!
R1XRCWQEJQB8YB,4,"Great set, but the headphones fall off your head to easily.  Sound quality and construction are excellent.  I highly recommend it."
R1YI2UA73ATTDY,2,"It is not comfortable at all, after half an hour of listening I felt like taking them off...I'm no audiophile either, but the sound quality was not AMAZING like some are claiming"
R32F0NZZJ4B12W,3,"Extremely hard to figure out, but once you get it right, it works great. I wish they had a better tutorial to help with each TV brand. It seriously took over an hour to hook up to a viore brand flat screen. I tried to hook it up to my Philips and still no luck. They need to make this kind of stuff a little easier...."
RNS73W4Q1JBR1,5,No complaints.  Do not hesitate to buy.  Works with plasma tv.  Bought an extra set and they both work equally well with one transmitter!
ROLHJHY8V6SOQ,1,"Maybe I'm spoiled.  I purchased and returned these headphones almost immediately.<br /><br />The feel of the ear cups are very uncomfortable.  They are flat and do not &#34;cup&#34; your ear at all.  They literally will fall off your head if you move, turn or look down too fast.  That could be overlooked if the quality of the sound was good.  Of all the headset/headphones I've tried, these were among the worst sounding.  There was little to no bass at all and for me that was a killer."
R1GOTE8CZ1IH4P,5,These headphones are awesome. Yea they could use some improvement on button layout but for the price they sound great and have great range... For those of you that want more get the more expensive ones!
RDKUA99HQL5X9,5,"Purchased to use while watching TV at night, wife goes to sleep early. It's totally amazing! And when she was reading and I was watching, she would wear earplugs, not any more. The sound quality is excellent, I hear more sounds now with the headphones, even at a low volume. You can hear the sound shift from left to right, etc.<br />We mostly stream video, no cable/satellite, do over the air for local stations, so I had to plug into the back of the Roku box and would need to do the same for the DVD player. I believe a new TV would handle this via the audio output.<br />We use an exercise bike while watching sitcoms via Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and would have to crank up the volume while riding, so it was loud, these headphones are the best. Same with listening to Pandora or Radio Paradise, I can walk around the house. My wife plans to start using while she vacuums."
R1S7KGF89V3MF1,5,No more getting yelled at by my wife to turn the volume down.  I can watch what I want at the volume I want.  Great product.
R3NDUUKS2ZPE8F,5,"I love it, I use with my Panasonic LCD TV with the 1/4 audio output, no interference, no more than 6-8 meter of coverage around the transmitter.  It sound perfectly..."
R6O1E3CY04T75,1,My first one lasted for years with very heavy use. The base unit stopped working with barely six months light use.
RMH341ER85I7A,4,these were a gift for my mother - they work fine and I found them to be quite comfortable.  She did not like the way the feel on her head after an hour or so.  I think no others would be better however.  They definity do help her hear the tv better however.
R3ROCK6T4MSKPX,4,Would have given 5 stars...except the headset does not fit securely on the head...keeps sliding off...I called Sennheiser customer service...they knew this and said I would have to purchase  next model up to get a better more secure fit...not a good answer...<br />BH
R2DQ0BTZ7D51ZG,5,I love the way you can go into any room and still hear the TV. I can also have the TV turned down when friends who are not hard of hearing like I am.
R1W6ZD60LDOJ7V,5,"My husband has used the Sennheiser headphones in our home in North Carolina.  When our Florida home headphones wore out, he knew he wanted Sennheiser.  No one carried them locally so we ordered them through Amazon.<br /><br />They work well, are not bulky and hook up easily."
R2SXG27NVD0IY,5,"Very nice and easy to use.  Excellent sound quality.  Comfortable to wear through an entire evening of TV viewing.  Since I wear hearing aids, I don't use it anymore but am considering going back to it due to the poor quality of TV and movie sound on my Sony Bravia flat screen."
REKJT0JV5V865,3,not so bad but not great.  sound is ok but there is a back ground noise even if you tune it.  its ok for what i want which is to watch tv when everyone is sleeping.  for great sound i would look else where.
RMRGZM8RVI4EO,5,"LOVE THEM!!! I've gone through a series of headphones for my office cubicle.  My office is like a library - dead silent... DRIVES ME NUTS!!! I 1st bought a 15 foot cable to hook to my iPod classic (no bluetooth) so I could turn and reach the file cabinet or binders - without taking my headset off.  But that kept getting tangled - snagged in the arm of my chair... or something else. Did that for about a year and then I realized - &#34;There's got to be wireless out there&#34;... but I went cheap... and ended up throwing away the cheap stuff.  My own danged fault buying from Ebay China for $15 bucks... Anyway. Just last week I got fed up and left EBAY and checked out these reviews here on Amazon...<br /><br />This product is PERFECT.  had it hooked up at my cubicle in about five minutes.  my classic iPod hooked right up to the cables with the included adapter and with a roll of the tuner dial... I was listening to pretty decent sounding music.  I'm not some sound junkie who's got to have BOSE quality sound... (not that I wouldn't mind - just dont have that cash).<br /><br />For the price this is PERFECT... As of right now, I can't find a CON..."
R48FK4G5J0OSC,4,"I bought these headphones (HDR120) for my mother who needed the tv volume louder than what was comfortable for others when watching tv.  She also will watch tv late a night which can sometimes interfere with the sleep of guests.  I specifically bought these headphones since they were wireless and operated in the 900MHz frequency range and would not receive interference from the operating frequencies of most household electronics present in households today such as Bluetooth, expandable wireless telephones, and wireless routers.  The 900MHz range doesn't require line of sight for receiving a signal and has a good performance through barriers such as walls.<br /><br />They are light weight and comfortable when wearing them for extended periods.  The lows, mids, and highs are great for the price.  It has an auto-off feature that shuts the base station (TR120 transmitter) off after receiving no signal for a time period (from tv, home theater receiver, etc.)  The transmitter will automatically turn back on after receiving a signal again.  There are LEDs which indicate when the unit is charging the headphones (red) and when the unit is on and receiving a signal (green).  It has a built-in tuner that allows for fine tuning of the transmitted signal should it not be clear initially.  The reception distance works as advertised through normal home construction materials such as wood, drywall, brick, etc. (performance will vary depending on the thickness and types of walls/materials in your home).  That being said, most people are in the same room as the tv when watching it, but it might affect you should you have them connected through a home theater receiver and be listening to music.<br /><br />I love the built-in, rechargeable batteries in the headphones which are recharged when place on the cradle.  There are metal contacts located between the padding which rests on the top of your head.  When the headphones are placed on the stand, the metal contacts on the headphones rest on the metal contacts on the stand and the circuit is completed allowing the batteries to recharge.  The batteries easily last through a day of use and then some.<br /><br />The transmitter can be easily connected to any tv or home theater receiver which has an RCA connector, 3.5mm (1/8&#34;) or 6.3mm (1/4&#34;) stereo connector with the provided cable/adapter.  The frequency response from 22Hz - 19.5kHz covers the majority of the accepted human hearing range (20Hz - 20kHz).<br /><br />Overall, the RS120 wireless headphone system is a winner.  The only criticism I have is that they are &#34;on the ear&#34; as opposed to &#34;over the ear&#34; headphones.  However, this is a personal preference.  Replacement ear pads are available."
RLNMP1V65B4MZ,2,Bought this headset. It works well when it does. There are several issues i have with this headset:<br /><br />- Battery life is limited<br />- Range is limited<br />- Sometimes you just get noise<br />- Large and a bit clunky<br />- Comfortable for the first 30 minutes. After that my ears would get warm.<br /><br />I would watch a movie with these on and after a while i wanted to remove them.
R3SWJX0ZG8EGYP,1,"Review About the Seller<br /><br />To all who will be reading this review, let me first clarify that this review is not much about the product as much as it is about the seller &#34;Amazon Marketplace&#34;. However, if you just need review about the headphones, please scroll down. I bought 2 of these refurbished headsets, and paid almost $20 bucks extra as compared to the other sellers, thinking that as they come from mazon, I will get a complete set. I was absolutely wrong. Although the first set was complete, the whole instructions were missing, which made it difficult to install. However, after some trial and error, and made it to work.<br /><br />Now it was time to install the second set. Except for the headset and transmitter, everything else was missing. Although the description said, &#34;may be repackaged&#34; it came in a box which was half torn. Then the unit came as &#34;Swicthed On&#34;, due to which the rechargeable batteries within the unit leaked. Also it was misiing the bigger audio jack as well as the main 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2X RCA Female Adapter, which you would require to connect it to your HDTV. Even worst its been almost a week, I have tried to contact the seller, but still havent recieved any response. I have not been able to use it so far due to all missing components.<br /><br />Review About the Headphones<br /><br />The headphones are built strong and give you a very comfortable feel. It took some time to properly tune them and they seem to be catching some other radio frequencies, but once they are tuned, they work fine. Minor thing whihc I observed that they sometime miss the audio inbetween for few seconds, but then come back up. One complaint is that they come with very poor standard rechargeable batteries. So at some poin you might have to invest in good chargeable batteries. Rest so far they are wroking fine. Will give 4 out 5 for the headphones, but very disappointed with Amazon marketplace,"
RE12VT84I5UUF,5,"They're everything I had hoped for and more.  Beautiful sound.  I now hear the most subtle of sounds.  Everyone should own a pair, even if they're not doing it to be good to their significant other who enjoys reading in the same room."
R3FL6XZBJQ41DN,4,Headphones are great in every respect other than (as noted by other reviews) the fact that they will fall off of your head. If you wear a cap then they stay in place.
RH81YO2QGYQSL,4,"Had to switch to headphones, after editing video using M-Audio speakers for years.  Excellent sound quality, I'm hearing bass response I didn't hear from my speakers at low sound levels.  Very comfortable headphones. They are better than I expected, and I like having wireless headphones. The tuning is a bit touchy--we have 2 folks using them in nearby cubes.  I'm a bit disappointed that after 5 or 10 minutes with no audio sources, you can hear static through the phones, from loss of signal, I guess.  Not a problem for folks that use them continuously, but it annoys me now and then as I'm playing a series of video clips."
R3CQXNZGUUCVI,1,"First week of use -- periodically shocked by a horrible screeching sound -- impossible to tune to avoid that sound. It happens several times each hour. I read all the instructions and followed to the letter. I positioned the transmitter in accordance with recommendations. Despite my precautions, I periodically get blasted by a very loud screeching sound. I have tried the three available channels and cannot get relief from the problem. I have not yet tried tech support that Amazon makes available on this product, so I will try that and attempt to make these workable. When the phones are working, the sound is good. Not great, but good. I will update this review if I can solve the problem with help.<br />If I can't make this work, the product is going back and I'll be trying the much more expensive Sony surround sound headphones.<br />I say it at the end of every one of the rare reviews I post when I'm dissatisfied with the product -- Thank God for Amazon. . .<br />Update -- I gave it a good try -- tried every combination of settings to try to make this headset work. It would work for a short while and the noises would begin again. Low volume background noise very frequently, but the most dismaying problem was an occasional very high volume screeching sound. I was unable to make that go away. I'm sending this back to Amazon."
R2RD26FFMEENT9,1,The product that I received is defective. This wireless headphone<br />doesn't receive signal properly and all I hear is noise. I have tried<br />various settings on the device and even changing the batteries but to no<br />avail. The problem is that I am outside US now and returning back the item<br />would cost be more than the price of the item. Please don't buy this product. Total waste of money!!
R3NR2SHWDPISBG,3,"The headphones on my ears hurt....I can't wear anything over my ears, and these ache after just a short while...darn!  Otherwise they are terrific!!"
RD0TBKPH75H2H,5,"I've been using these headphones nearly two years now and love them. While they have on occasion had issues with interference cutting the wireless signal out, my overall experience remains entirely positive.<br /><br />I mostly use these while working and they help me to get and stay &#34;in the zone&#34; when writing code or doing other technology work. I also use them to zone in on the video games I play.<br /><br />The range on these is amazingly good. I can walk up two floors without signal degradation."
RBEN5XSO4BYTO,5,We can all watch a movie in peace now!  My family can watch without subtitles now....I can hear everything so clear.  I was missing a lot of things in movies.  Not any more.  I have two sets now!
R2QERJIGIQR80R,2,"fuzzy sound, 900mhz is probably not the way to go as it gets interference from outside and it teases the listenere by working well and then fuzzing out.  I gave them to Good Will"
R9693M9HFH0PD,5,"I use it to shield others from the tv noise at times.  It actually makes some dialog more clear!  The recharging feature is great!  Nice, light and comfortable headphones."
RQJIBOF2SNO96,5,My son used these in his apartment to avoid annoying his neighbors and recommended them.  The sound is clear and it is amazing how much I hear on TV that I previously missed.  Love the wireless feature and the charging station.
R16DZYDQG883HT,5,"For a significant amount of time, my elderly father has been increasingly turning up the volume on the television, but refusing to see a hearing specialist. Because this is so disruptive to the household and my mother, I had mentioned he should pick up some headphones or look into something. Being a typical guy, a year went by and the volume just got turned louder and louder.<br /><br />Cue a home visit, where I simply had enough of the screeching. Pulled out the laptop and headed here to Amazon. After reading a significant number of reviews and the questions, settled on Sennheiser RS120. Within 48 hours it was at the house. Within 12 hours it was charged. And within 12 minutes it was hooked up. Because they have a new TV that doesn't have the old red/white audio ports, I had to plug it into the TIVO box, which is actually preferable because it's easier to get there than behind the wall-mounted television. You can mute the TV so only the headphone-wearer hears sound, or you can adjust the volume of the headphones and the TV speaker output independently, such that each listener gets his or her own volume control. The earpads are substantial and soft, and everything about the product - from its packaging in the box to its design and instruction manual - is well made and easy to understand. At first it took a few minutes to tune to the right frequency so there wasn't any static, but after several weeks of use, the sound is crystal clear and additional tuning has very seldom been needed.<br /><br />As an absolute curmudgeonly cynic, my father was bound and determined to find something wrong with this. A month later, and his only complaint it that it fits a bit loosely, which is probably a deliberate design choice so the wearer doesn't get a tension headache. So while he can't bend and do toe-touches while wearing the earphones, he can putz around, grab treats from the fridge, pet the dog - all while leaving the rest of us in quiet peace. In other words, it's completelyworth the price tag."
R39OT6Q5IAR54D,5,"Excellent product, great quality and 200-300 ft range.  Used everyday. Sound is far better than I expected. Excellent charge system. Highly recommend!"
R2HQNPY21TN26D,5,What a great product.  I needed a comfortable set of headphones to listen to DVD's and TV programs while my sick husband sleeps.  This is a quality product at a good price and feels really good on my head for hours at a time.
R16A6MKAE28QPQ,5,I purchased these headphones for my Mom who is very hard of hearing. In the past she has had a very hard time hearing the television news and sporting events. The first time she tried the Sennheiser RS-120 Headphones she smiled and almost shouted. &#34;I can hear!&#34; The sound is clear and crisp and the operation is easily managed. It was the best gift I could have given my Mom.
R2M8IWFOGOO1ZX,5,"These earphones have &#34;saved our marriage&#34;. My husband puts these on, and the tv can be on mute if I don't want to hear it. He can walk into the kitchen for a snack and not have to pause the program.<br />When he's not around, I'll even use them for clarity. Great product!"
R2YKP3K12MW8Z5,5,Have had these for a couple of months and use them several times a week. They have been charged only once so far. They sound amazing and I haven't had any problems at all. Great product.
R1F3E28EJ9847N,5,"clear sounds, comfortable, better than others I had tried.  .love that the sound is not obstructed by walls.  helps me enjoy many shows that were hard to understand"
R1N46AGO1GVLFN,5,The headphones are very easy to install and use. There are sometimes little bit of noice related to the fm transmission.
RLVHE4FAX2AR5,1,I have had other Sennheiser headphones (R130) and bought these when they wore out. These are horrible. They do not stay on your head if you move around at all. The sound is OK but their wearability makes them useless.
RCF56AR0COW31,2,"I purchased these in December 2012 for watching television and they worked well in allowing me to hear while doing things around the house.  They were comfortable, though they would too easily slip off my head when leaning my head forward.  One day in the summer of 2013, there was some lightning in the area and we lost power for a moment.  The headphones weren’t even being used at the time, but later that day we tried to use them and they wouldn’t turn on.  I tried several tricks to get them to work, but they haven't worked since."
R2RCDJ6VNQFGQ4,5,"Works so much better than our older Sony Wireless headset. This is lighter, more comfortable, and I don't have to jack up the volume all the way to get the sound to work through the headphones."
R1OLODQP2IA2U6,3,"these headphones work very well, but are pretty heavy and if you bend your head down without thinking, they will fall off."
R2RICQY73AJT7E,4,They seem to be excellent headphones for anyone that may be hard of hearing they do not get hot and actually do help clear and amplify the sound they charge quickly and last a very long time I've never had them run out of battery power excellent all-around product
R1FCREO3FRFNPA,5,"I know these are supposed to be just over entry level quality, so I can only wonder how amazing the higher models are. I bought them for my husband who is deaf. Finally he can watch TV and actually hear the sound track. The entire sound track including the background. I got two pair, so we have a set of these in the BR and another in the LR. They have improved the quality of his life many times over. Reasonably priced, they work exactly as promised. But better.<br /><br />THREE YEARS LATER: IWe've had two sets of these headphones for three years and they are in constant use. They have vastly improved my husband's world. Not only can he hear the sound, but he can hear the separation and sounds that I, with normal hearing, cannot hear using regular speakers. I am about to buy another set of headphones for him because they have gotten loose from wear. I don't know about any hiss because we don't have any in ours. Maybe it's the signal that's the difference. We have a very high quality signal and it is very clean. Three years. NO problems. None. We haven't even needed new batteries."
R1VY2GN55ERF30,2,"I thought that I would put my two cents in. I bought a pair of these in 2009. I really haven't used them much. But I decided to dust them off and put them to work, They have never been abused so I look upon them as almost new. One of the ear pieces quit working. After trouble shooting them I am certain that it is the head set and not the other connections. This is a huge disappointment as being out of warranty, it would cost more to have them fixed than to replace them. Otherwise, the sound quality was acceptable (for the money). I don't like the idea of a charger base/transmitter however. It reduces the portability. I will try to avoid that feature next time. All in all, I thought that Sennheiser was a good quality brand. Now I am not so sure."
RD945IPLQ9DOD,4,"I use this headset for watching TV at night. It works quite well with a long battery life (6+ hours) and good sound. It does suffer from a bit of static if turned just so but for the most part, has excellent sound. The easy to use charging cradle is really a top feature."
R3K1V1RL9KB5IR,5,Purchased for a family member with profound hearing loss; now he can watch TV without disturbing the neighbors 2 houses down.
RGHIQ8U783CXF,4,Loved them. Had them for about a year and upgrade to a better model. Great beginners buy.<br /><br />Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle...
RS0FU3ERR7S1G,4,Nice wireless Headset quality sound great range but they don't cup your ears they just slid over your ears and sit on top so if you move your head to quickly they slid off your head
R8O6K51YF3YM6,3,These were great but after less than 2 years quit working for no reason explainable.  Kind of expensive to then quit so soon after.
R2VUT8ISAHD68K,4,Took a younger person to setup but my husband doesn't miss any of the show now we love it thanks
R16IXWBB3UCIV0,5,No background hiss; good range - covers the house and half the backyard (2 acres) so I can go out with the dogs while still hearing the news and drinking coffee.  Very satisfied.
R2YLA58MADSO61,5,The headphones have surprising clarity and bass response. RF range is good and allows continued listening in adjacent rooms. The inside surface however is a flat fabric which tends to slip when one bends over - my only objection. Charging takes place through the two support wires and a LED indicates good contact.
R1C753ZQNSLVTC,5,It is every thing I wanted and more. Sound is great and the headphones are comfortable. I would recommend to a friend.  Also the price is less than buying local.
R2JJLKAG3QWURM,2,"Hi,<br /><br />I choosed this product by the brand, i respect it.<br /><br />Sadly, i'm disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The overall build quality is very good, the charging base is firm, the charging method it's great, simple ( no eletric chock if you touch the contacts :) ) and it simple works, never got an dead battery, allways charged and stands a full work day without problems.<br />The sound is clear, there is some hiss, since it's an wireless device it's understandable, with sound playing it dissapears.<br /><br />Now the cons...<br />It keep falling from my head.<br />Leaks A LOT, i tried to fix it... stuffed some paper towel on inside the cans... ( yeah... yeah... i know ) helped a little, but didn't solved the problem, since i bought this to use on my work enviroment, they are useless... my coworkers complain about the leak all the time, even in mid/low volumes.<br />Bass is poor... i have an 5 yr old pair of phillips SHP-2700, they blow this set out of the water...<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Because the flaws i'ts not usefull to me, and i was missing the bass, then i had to sold my unit... and got an sony BTN-200, they sound a lot better than this set, they have an outstanding battery life ,40 hrs ( !!!!!!!!!!!! ), so theres no problem with dead batteries either.<br /><br />Link:<br />[[ASIN:B00B2G2GSU Sony DR BTN200 Wireless Bluetooth Headphone]]"
RK4PY9BM5BP67,5,"They work very well for my T.V. viewing, as I am hard of hearing, it makes it a lot easier to understand what they are saying. Good product."
R1HSUW70GY4XF6,5,"This is an excellent set of headphones.  The sound quality is absolutely excellent.  Very clear.  I highly recommend these headphones to anyone that wants independent control of the sound level from what a TV or stereo will put out by itself.  I have a set of these myself and I just gave a set to a friend who is hard of hearing.  He can, and does, wear them and can adjust the sound level to suit him without affecting anyone else in the room.  The batteries have an excellent life before requiring a recharge.  The base and charger are easy to use and work very well.  Sennheiser will have my headphone business for a good long time to come..."
RF8QHRKZCWV90,1,"Auto-shutoff. The base station shuts itself off if it doesn't sense audio for a while... for example, if you pause a DVD or TV, to go to the bathroom, or whatever, when you come back, you'll notice the base station has autoshutoff, but the headphones haven't, so they will be squealing SUPER LOUDLY since there is no signal coming from the transmitter. You could get hearing damage from this \\""feature\\""."
R234RMXL59T8QX,4,"I bought these bad boys for work.  I work in a very large lab, where the 30 foot range of most wireless headphones wouldn't get me very far.  These headphones deliver a pretty good quality sound through out the lab, despite our equipment everywhere.  I can even use them in my cubical 50 feet or so outside the lab, through several interior walls.  I do notice a light hiss sometimes, but not enough to bother me.  I've used FM transmitters as well as cassette tapes in cars before...this has waaaaay less static and hiss.<br /><br />I also tried these in my house, connected to a receiver rather than the desktop with a crappy sound card in the lab.  Sound quality was phenomenal when the higher power and higher quality signal was delivered to the transmitter. I was able to work out in the yard with these and have only minimal interference (about like using an FM radio headset)  I 100% recommend these headphones.  I don't think you'll be disappointed."
R11UEGFEVPFOEX,4,Headphones work really well.  Can hear dialogue better than even turning up the volume on the tv.  One thing I don't like is it makes ears hot. (not sure if it is the material or something electronic in the earphone getting hot)  Headband is also a little annoying. It messes up my wifes hairdo.  My wife also says band is a little tight and hurts her head.  But the pros outweigh the cons.
R1NFKX9VZ23K39,5,"Works great once we figured out the set up. Was a little different with our  TV ,but is clear and my mother loves it. Can watch without annoying anyone as late as she can stay up."
R1TNCGAZLKCPWE,5,"I purchased these headphones because  I watch TV late at night and didn't want to disturb others in the house or my neighbors.  They are comfortable to wear, sound quality is good and charging is quite easy.  You can hear things like the telephone but not normal ambient noise in the room.  I can easily hear no matter where I am in my house, even when I am on a different floor and I have three levels to my home.  I would recommend these headphones for anyone one looking for good quality but not break their finances."
R3V3XNGZ30LIZC,5,"We needed headphones with an adapter for a TV's headset jack and this was the best solution for us. This is our 2nd pair since my husband and I both have TVs in the same room and he decided he didn't want a cable tethering him after seeing my &#34;freedom&#34; with these. These allow us to watch TV together even when watching different shows and we don't have interference since there are 3 different channels available. The reception is great as I walk around the house, even to the basement to do laundry. The headphones adjust very well for my small head size and my husband's larger head size - and aren't uncomfortable for a few hours of watching or more."
RTXQ3WJ9A533Y,2,WOW! You've got to have a really thick skull and be comfortable with vise-like ear pressure to enjoy wearing these. Gave up and returned them.
R3V4GN7KRGZEB9,5,At night I use this so my wife can sleep - she works early in the day.  I had no idea it could provide such sound quality and clarity.<br />And I'm rather hard of hearing so often can't distinguish dialogue from background sounds - this really does a fine job.
R37IJW4EHHNXER,5,"As I've gotten older, my hearing has depleted to the point that my wife was constantly telling me the tv in my mancave is so loud that she can hear it all over the house. Now I mute the tv, put on my headphones and I can hear perfectly and my wife hears nothing!  The rechargeable batteries that came with it stay charged by hanging them on the convenient stand (transmitter) so they're always ready to go. I have never had them run down.  I love it!"
R3LSSW8L0AGORD,4,"Worked great once we figured out how to set them up correctly. They did not work when plugged into our TV, only once we went through the box from our satellite provider. (In case others are having trouble with setup, you might try that.) Once we figured this out, they work great! My husband has even said they are marriage saving. He can stay up watching a show or football game in bed, and I can sleep without being disturbed. Great product!"
R6WGFMZ03GV04,4,3rd one that I've purchased.  I now have one set for each of my TVs.  Nice that they are interchangeable!
R2DGQEZN2L1DVM,4,"These headphones work really well, transmitting for a good distance throughout my house, and even outside. The headphones are surprisingly lightweight given their size. With the transmitter upstairs, I get some hiss when I roam around downstairs or outside, but I can still listen. None of my wireless or wired electronics seem to affect the transmission negatively, which is great.<br />But I do have 2 objections.<br /><br />1. When the source turns off, the transmitter turns off. This makes a LOUD hiss through the headphones. I  have to remain vigilant for the end of my CD, because the player turns itself off to save energy. What a shocker!<br /><br />2. The headphones are way too loose on my head. I have had to buy very large hair clips to stabilize them on my head, because if I'm working while bending down, like in the garden, they shift around, fall off, or maybe push my glasses out of position so I can't see properly.<br /><br />I'm giving this product 4 stars because, in fact, it makes a really good job of the job it's meant to do."
R1SKZ6VTLWUTW8,5,"Great Buy.. These are grate. I hav very poor hearing and with these I can leave the TV at a reasonable , adjust the headphones to a comfortable level and sit back and enjoy the programs.<br />Worked fine right out of the box. Hook up and all took less than 30 minutes."
R3I0UJAB7Z9MDJ,1,Seriously this was frustrating.  First one came and didn't work at all.  Second one came and the Buzz was over the top!
RT1GESJ4ZH3QV,5,Great for those who have sleeping partners that watch TV while you're trying to sleep.  It's a great product and works great. Sound quality is perfect.
R3VQ4340AULP3N,5,I studied the reviews very carefully for these and other similar headphones.  I almost selected another brand then at the last minute changed to these.  I can not imagine why some customers had so much trouble with their Sennheisers.  These are fantastic.  I'm so pleased!  It took only about ten minutes before I was listening to crystal clear stereo audio coming from my TV.  Tuning was a piece of cake and head phones fit perfectly.  I ordered them on Thursday intend we're delivered on Saturday morning.  Wow! What great service.  I would recommend these for anyone.
R34ZCXTMMT46NA,2,"Occasional bursts of static noise during operation, scares way more that any horror movie you'd be watching while wearing these. Said noise is not suppressed when there is no input, so you have to turn the TV (or whatever) first, wait about 15 seconds, then turn headphones on. There is quite noticeable high-frequency background hiss, there is a trade-off between good quality and volume - best tune gives about 60-70% of available volume level, you can have a louder signal, but with a lot of static. Charging is for the cradle only, headphones has its own set of batteries and it's up to you whether it would be batteries or accumulators."
R16KV1R5WK9RAT,5,The product was delivered on time as stated. I love that I can now watch TV and hear everything that is said.The clarity is exceptional ! I can leave the TV room and still keep up with the program. I'm so impressed and recommend it to friends with a hearing loss such as I have.
R247KV5UNK0UV,5,"Fantastic product!... My husband researched many different types of 'wireless headphones' on the Internet,  and we decided on this one.<br />Anyhow, we are very pleased w/ our choice.<br />The item came perfectly packaged and  with good instructions.<br />We set-it up immediately, & as soon as they were charged, my husband used them right away.<br />He loves them!"
R3H67PRWTWU3AM,5,"This thing is the Bomb ! been waiting Along time to find it. Now my wife can enjoy the TV and so can I. seamless installation, almost installed it self. Great sound quality. Can listen to the TV anywhere in the house."
RM5CDUWN6AU50,5,The Headphones works as expected. Setup was simple and fast.Nice sound.Hopefully will last a while before I decided to go for other..
R15AF3NKLJA151,5,"My second pair.  First pair still going strong after almost 2 years.  Very comfortable, good battery life, and sound quality.  I have had no problems with range or interference.  The only issue I have noted, as others have, is they tend to fall off if you lean to far forward.  I use these for TV viewing late at night so that hasn't been much of a problem for me.  If you plane to use them while you are active around the house it could be an issue for you. Unless you can spend big $$, I doubt you will find a much better sounding or comfortable pair of wireless headphones."
R5D82K1PWRRFG,3,It sounds ok but it fits a little tight. some times it&#34;s hard to find the on and off switch because it's so tiny.
R25KD3C7V0WN0R,1,Utterly worthless.  Stopped working entirely after about 14 months.  Before their death they were noisy and the channels and tuning was VERY temperamental.  Perhaps Sennheiser made these as an incentive to but the more expensive headphones?
R3BFDZYESKPF2Y,5,I bought this for my husband. His TV bothers me when I want to read my Kindle. It's working great! TV won't bother me any more!
R1C13F35CLIF0K,5,"I live in a condo building without a lot of soundproofing..  I use headphones when I watch TV late at night so I don't disturb anyone. The old Sony model  I had gave up the ghost, and isn't available anymore. After researching various other brands and models and reading the reviews, I chose this model.  I'm so happy I did.  My old unit had to be in sight of the base.  Moving around in the bedroom, I would lose the sound.  With this Sennheiser, I can walk thru the entire apartment and not lose the sound.  The sound quality is good, and the headphones fit on my ears better that the Sony did - there is more of a surround sound feel to this new pair. These also stay on my head better than the old pair.  They were easy to set up right out of the box, and to date I have not had any problems with them.  I recommend them."
R1GR1SLKBJGAHG,4,"Quality sound.  Great price.  Range is adequate, but walked into next room (12-15ft) and sound became staticky.  Wish they would have placed the volume and channel on separate sides.  You try to adjust volume and you sometimes change channel/frequency.  Overall good purchase."
R9TRGNJSLQRJK,4,I have not purchased such an item before so I have no basis for comparision but they do what I need them to do.  I can hear the TV while I'm at the frig. etc perhaps 25 feet & a couple walls away.  I do not use them to listen to music so I have no comment in that regard but the sound quality is very good for general/sports TV watching.
R13DZJCTW1OK36,5,I had a RS 120 previously for almost 9 years and the head set and transmitter were excellent<br />The nice feature about the headset is that you can set it on the transmitter and it recharges itself overnite
R1GH4VPMSPJJQ2,5,"I waited for over 2 weeks to post this review. I wanted to give ample time to adequately test the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones. I had concerns before ordering this product. Setup was very easy. Concern #1: I expected to receive cheap foam pads. I was grateful for the fabric covering that hopefully will last for a few years. Concern #2: I have a smaller head, and when I sit still, it's OK. I can wear my Kangol and the headset fits much better. Concern #3: Hiss. I make sure the headset is fully charged. The hiss is either hardly noticeable, or nonexistent. Concern #4: Tuning and volume dials. After I tuned them into my widescreen, I used a small piece of duct tape to cover the tune button. That way I don't accidentally disturb the tuning. Concern #5: Range.  Range is good. I can go 30 feet away through walls, and still receive. The frequency response is very good. Bass is good. Highs are good. I have watched a variety of shows and movies, and enjoy hearing the enhanced listening experience. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. They are definitely worth the price. Enjoy! 5 stars!"
R3NGN3UNFR1583,4,this was recommended by a friend and I find it is a really good headset...great price and good sound. Very nice listening.
RTPTFNOB0AZM4,3,"The sound from the unit is excellent. The headphones are comfortable.  But no matter where I place the receiver it cuts out every 3-5 minutes for 2-30 seconds at a time.  It's tolerable so I'm going to keep it and maybe try some more locations.<br /><br />The unit also has inconvenient, poorly designed power and input connections.  The power wire is fixed in the unit.  When I want to move the unit I have to unplug the power wire from the source, pull it out from my cabinet and rerun it back to the power source rather than just unplugging it from the unit and reconnecting the power wire at the new receiver location.  The input wire is very difficult to plug into the unit and to remove it.  I had to use needle nose plier to get it out.  I wonder if the people who makes these ever use them themselves."
R3FGJZ3M0IGVYM,5,"I have 3 of these and we use them all the time.  One is connected to the computer, the one of each of 2 TVs.  They get used everyday!  Absolutely love them.  The range is far enough that I can go out into my garden and work and still get good reception."
R2A04CSIZT4RPH,5,"I've had these headphones for several months and have not had any problems.  They sound great and, although a bit big, they're comfortable."
R1B4MVUFA0UXD6,3,"I researched this item and others extensively prior to purchase, but it just shows that nothing can quite replace an actual in-home test. It works fine except for two problems: when I plug the headphones in, the TV speakers shut off, so that no one else in the room can still hear anything, and that the headphones only work on my system's television setting, not on the DVD setting. If I switch my sound system to the DVD setting, there is no sound at all. For a system using multiple devices and speakers, I cannot recommend these headphones."
R1G003IQSPKKDI,5,"I use these with the transmitter plugged into the headphone jack of an electric guitar amp.  Sounds really good and doesn't drive others out of the house. I've had mine for years -- even though the price has gone up, I would still recommend them."
R1WTM274QXQJY,3,"I like these headphones: in most respects they are a step above my previous Phillips brand: the easy charging system, great sound, long long range.<br /><br />I like the way they sound - music is great with them. They also get plenty loud enough for me (office environment).<br />The charger is awesome - I just place them on the cradle overnight every few days, and they are always charged. I think I have run them down once. And if they die, I can throw in a couple of AAAs to get through the rest of the day. The battery life is way better than my old set.<br />The range on this is at least twice my old pair. I can walk all over our office with them and still hear.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I don't like about them tho:<br />1) They aren't as comfortable as the Phillips. My head is on the larger size, and I wear glasses, so YMMV. But they can hurt if I wear them all day. I guess I don't like On Ear headphones.<br />2) If I look down, they tend to fall off my head. Since I use them at work where I'm pretty much always looking straight ahead at a computer screen this isn't a big deal for me, but they have come off a few times when I bend over to pick something up.<br />3) The tuning dial is in a terrible location. I accidentally bump it a lot. It is right next to the volume control, and is just as exposed. I can easily bump it when I'm picking the headphones up, which lowers the volume and sound quality (if it even still works).<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with them, but I have to deduct stars for the tuning dial placement (Hello Sennheiser! Move it or cover it or something.) and for the issues I have with the fit.<br /><br />If they made these in an over the ear configuration and fixed the tuning dial, they'd be pretty close to perfect."
R1UM02VT03BHAM,4,"These are great! I just wish they fit more snug when I move around the house, otherwise I'm very satisfied with these and the sound is great."
RSET49RQT20ID,4,"Sound quality is very good. A bit bulky to wear, but overall feeling is comfortable. Would highly recommend these headphones."
R1K4FXDVIU008A,5,"I bought one for my husband who is hard of hearing. He has hearing aids, but he takes them out when watching TV. I love watching TV now. The volume is turned down now and I am sure our neighbors are glad also. Just bought another one for our Aunt. She loves it too and so does her family. Thank you."
R2W5ZSHNKK32HE,5,These are a million times better than any bluetooth headphones. I can walk into my garage on the other side of a concrete wall and I can still hear perfectly. Our mailbox is almost 100 feet away from the charging/sending unit and I can walk all the way with barely any loss of sound. These are very reliable. This is my second set and I'm still using the first set that are a couple of years old. I have one on the computer and one on the tv.
RIWYO1EZ5AWFE,5,"I've had my Sennheiser headphones about 6 years and been completely satisfied with them. Just now, after much use, the plastic headband has cracked and I'm looking for replacements. Guess what I'm going to buy......you guessed it, another of the same make and model.<br /><br />I've found them to be extremely comfortable to wear, even when watching long movies on TV (my primary use). I use them particularly to watch TV shows in which I need help with hearing high frequencies, particularly women's voices. High frequency hearing deficiency is common with older folks like myself. These headphones have been a lifesaver in that respect.<br /><br />I also use them when watching high-quality musical programs. The outstanding music reproduction and stereo/surround quality of these headphones is amazing. Frequency response seems well balanced and doesn't have the high boom-boom bass of many modern headphones targeted to kids.<br /><br />Another use is that my wife likes to watch TV at low sound volume. I prefer higher volume. With the headphones we can each have it our way.<br /><br />I also like the fact that I can be watching a TV program and be able to get up and get a snack or take a bathroom break in the middle of a show and not miss any dialog. Yes, the further you get away from the sending unit, the more likely that the signal will break up but that's to be expected.<br /><br />In the 6 years I've owned them, I've only replaced the rechargeable batteries once, and that was simply a preventative measure, not a necessary one. I don't know how much useage is possible on a single charge because I've never had them expire. I normally use them two or three times and then put them back on the charger.<br /><br />I'm buying another pair and look forward to another 6 years or more of use."
R1NGBJU8W2AVT1,5,bought for my husband with poor hearing to save mine. He loves them so much we have bought 2 more pairs. one for other room and one for camper.
R1WWNJPB3LNR2W,1,These headphones sound great. However there is one problem with them. When there is no audio going to them after roughly two minutes suddenly a loud static sound happens. It is loud and very annoying. I contacted Sennheiser tech support and was told that is what happens when the headphones lose communication with the transmitter. Amazon was gracious in allowing me to return the item. This is really unfortunate because like I said they do sound great. Except for the loud static noise.
R328IX4ZPWHFCC,4,only one complaint: unit is not rechargeable; it uses batteries.  Sound quality is very good.  I don't see any way for the 'charging cradle' to work
R3850WNTC2G73D,5,I've been using this headphone for several weeks now and really enjoy the clarity of sound it delivers. No static whatsoever and easy operation.<br />I recommend it very much.
R3T0AA7JPDYEA1,5,"I use these daily, when working with heavy equipment, in a noisy shop. The transmission is great, the sound is great. If I had to suggest and improvement, I'd only want the rig to block out a little more of the outside noise, but I dont' even know if that is possible. Sennheiser should come out with a sound cancelling rig that is wireless; that would be the prime audio device!"
R1DO8ZQCJJPSFX,5,"Clear, comfortable, the best one I've tried through the years. Hubby loves it too. Finally I can have quiet while he watches TV. :)"
ROPHUPYXU0NSC,5,This is my second set of these headphones.My first set lasted for 6yrs. and I could go anywhere in my 2story home and even in the back yard and still had crystal clear clarity.No these headphones are not the best quality for music but the do an excellent job for the tv.I can listen to tv at night and not disturb my wife's sleep so if you are looking at this set for the same reason that I use them for than this is the set to buy.
R1GTA88Y4YV97L,5,Really like these headphones. Great sound! Item dies what its meant to do. Works fine.Item dies what its meant to do. Works fine.Item dies what its meant to do. Works fine.
R2L56O3GKNPS9K,5,"I love my new headset. I had an older type headset which I thought were very good until I got these . Wow! what a different, I guess I didn't know what I was missing. They are very comfortable and I how hear sounds that I was missing on the old headset. The setup was very easy just a matter of plugging them in."
R3Q8A4Y4KPDLH7,5,"I am hearing impaired and find great difficulty in watching television.  Closed captioning is a must, but does not provide background music, or inflection in the speaking roles.  The headphones are an ideal accessory to enhance the full spectrum of the dialogue and sound effects which greatly increases my enjoyment."
RSRB0HI2LE3GJ,5,This is the second pair I have in my home. Easy to set up and to use. The sound in great and my wife can use the regular TV sound as she wants without interference. If you need to leave the TV to go to another room just keep the head phones on as you will not lose the sound although this may not work in a larger home. The second pair is used in the back bedroom and does not get inerference from the other one in he living room  although you may need to selecct a separate channel (there are 3 to select from).The sound volume is very easy to use but the tone selector may cause problems until you get used to using it. The headphone is easily adjustable to fit your head and are comfortable but do feel a little heavy. When you are done using them be sure to turn the headphone off and fully extend the headphone adjustment before placing them on the charging cradle otherwise you will not get a good contact and the charging lite does not come on. I have had no issues with either set but I did want to ask a question from their techical service through their emai line and got a fast respone. I  highly recommend this wireless headphone anad the cost is reasonable but do shop around for the lowest costs as there is variation among the vendors.
R1XR54FVWDNKH4,1,This is the second Sennheiser RS120 that I have purchased.  The first set did not communicate with the TV after about a year or so.  I thought that since it was a couple of years old something burned out.  I bought the second set on June 2012.  It worked fine until about two weeks ago when the static started.  I use headphones because I am hard of hearing and have use them all the time.  I can't use the present RS120 because the static is getting worse.  I am going to have to look for another brand because this Sennheiser product does not stand up to everyday use.
R2S3PYN5762X5W,2,"Most of the time the headphones are fine, if a bit bulky; however, at times, for no apparent reason, static hits--and it is so sudden and so loud that I worry for the hearing I still have. . .therefore, I don't use them as much as I'd like.<br /><br />Doris Bridges<br />Homestead, FL"
RIAXXTHZZQ86L,1,Works fine with the stereo but WAY to much interference when used with TV - which was it's primary purpose.
R5MY38OKDW1U6,5,The headphones were purchased to help a senior with hearing problems listen to her favorite TV shows.  The set was easy to set up and easy for her to use.  I would recomment the earphones for ease of use and clarity of sound.
R17A4KWADAM9NA,5,"Love the sound. Worked right out of the box, plug and play.  Great sound, excellent range, clarity is astounding.  I have one complaint.  The earphones will not stay on your head if you bend over or lower your head at all.  It needs a second strap for more secure head fitting.  They charge effortlessly, and the batteries are sufficient to last all day, then some.  I have never had mine run down. I highly recommend this brand to anyone.  I depend on them to hear television due a severe hearing loss."
R2ZOQRAAQEK9X5,4,Just be careful not to go near computer or other electronic device while wearing headphones..you will hear very loud static.<br />Very clear;  great sound and you don't miss any of the dialogue.
R1B7PAIIRKZGPN,1,"Apparently, these devices do not work on a Plasma TV.  I did not know that this would be an issue and It would've been nice to know this information prior to ordering."
R29LFHY88WM3AB,5,"I have a hardtime hearing all the dialog on TV and was looking for a answer. I found it. The sound is clear, volume is adjustable, you have an on/off switch and your can adjust them for the best reception. I moved to different parts of the house and the sound was still clear with no noticable difference in volume or reception. Putting them in the charging cradle couldn't be easier. It is also a plus because I can turn the TV volume down so as not to bother the wife and I have no change in headset quality or volume. Great headphones."
R2H53HQN8WQPNU,5,"This is my second time purchasing the Sennheiser RS120.  First headphones lasted 2 years and would have lasted much longer had I not dropped them off my head in a puddle of water outside during a driving rainstorm.  Why would I be outside in a rainstorm, you might ask?  Well, I was under an umbrella and I did not expect them to fall off as I went out to check my mailbox.  The deal is that I love these headphones so much that I wear them nearly all day long as I go about my daily routine.  Indoors and outdoors.  They work so well that I forget I am wearing them.  I am getting hard of hearing so I rely on them to hear TV or music without blasting every one out of the house.  Mine work anywhere I am at:  inside my house or outside on my property ( one acre ).  I would be lost without these headphones.  Great Product!!!"
R1H7TRSZAAMCO3,4,"I bought a pair of these headphones to replace another identical set purchased over a decade ago.  The only reason the prior set failed was because the insulation on the audio cable became brittle, and flaked off, and shorted out within the unit.  I've got plenty of vinyl coated audio and power cords that have had the same troubles after a decade or two.  So I've got no complaints about the longevity of the product.<br /><br />The headphone quality and response is quite good, and like all non-bluetooth headphones, there's no lag.  So these are great for watching TV.<br /><br />The only downside to these is that they tend to fall off if one's head tilts too far forward.  A closed ear headphone solves the problem, but I find my ears get too hot in closed ear headphones.  As a result, I'm quite happy with these!"
R15HVJ78DJIG7O,5,"I purchased these headphones so I can watch TV at night if my girlfriend is sleeping. They're kind of bulky, but the sound is great. I could walk around the condo with these on and the sound is unhindered."
R2Q49AR366L4JZ,4,Got these wireless headphones because i was having trouble hearing my tv with all the background noise. They work pretty good. The only thing they could improve on is they dont cut out the background noise very good.
R270H9Y34ZUQ5V,4,"Best sound I have had from wireless headsets (this is my 4th one over the past 13 yrs.<br />Several reviewers had mentioned that the headset was loose fitting, that it easily slid off their heads.  And I have to agree.  I thought my head was bigger than most (as least my wife tells me that), so I was hoping that the headset would hug my head better.  But I was disappointed.  But the clarity of sound more than makes up for this minor inconvenience, that you can get used to after awhile."
R1G72LJT645F8M,5,"The sound quality is not the best, but pretty good for tv or MP3.  The fit is a little loose. Most people may like it that they rest lightly on the ears, but I have grown used to over the ear headsets that snugly cover the ear.  But the reception is quite good when you adjust the tuning well.  I can walk all over the house with good reception.  The base unit sits on top of my desktop cpu amid a 6.0 MHz telephone system and a wireless modem and there is no interference.  The batteries have lasted well and charge well.  And it's convenient to use."
RV86GOVBUJISO,5,worked much better and is more comfortable than the TV Ears that I hand purchased at a big box store
R3KBUKGML38WXR,5,"I had doubts about these because about 50% of the reviewers had trouble with static.  Yes...you can get an alarming burst of static IF you don't tune them.  However,...this problem becomes non-existent once they are tuned in.  The sound and performance is great.  I do not regret my purchase at all!  Awesome product,."
RJ5SPAI5YSSWK,5,"I have owned a set of these for about 12 years.  I gave them to my wife and bought a 2nd pair for myself.  They are both on the same frequency but connected to separate televisions.  I can pump up the sound system for football parties and she can watch NCIS or whatever.  I put mine on if I want to hear every nuance on a movie or whatever.  I'm sure audiophiles would scoff at this review, but they work for me.  Nice fit around the ears and easy to operate with 1.  on/off switch  2.  tuning wheel  3. volume control."
R30S2J6YZ19AG5,5,"After researching for all other brands, I finally decided for Sennheiser wireless headphones, and after a month using it I am very happy with it's quality. Works perfect and batteries last long. The delivery was very fast. I recommend."
R3DGXX75X9KC5T,4,"The sound from these headphones are really clear and detailed. I can hear the smallest things from my games. However, they slightly uncomfortable if worn for too long. Also, there's a little bit of static from time to time. Other than that, it's a great set of headphones."
RWST1IEEZGUC,5,"These speakers provide better sound than the TV - good sound quality.  Are comfortable to wear.  I like being able to walk anywhere in the apartment and still listen to the sound, I then know when the ads are over.  I can listen to films without annoying the neighbours.  Good price on Amazon."
R2RTF372WOZ2DB,5,"Excellent sound reproduction and comfortable ear cuffs. You can move around the home and still hear the sounds. The the transmitter/charger stand is  large and visible, but works well."
RS6MU58YU4LW3,5,"I can hear perfectly from my living room all the way to the back bedroom and out my back door to the lake 25 feet which 75 feet from the transmitter, And the back bedroom has no line of sight. Easy to set up and works with both headsets,"
R1QLWAUPI6KPHU,5,"great quality and fabulous sound. charging is easy.no problems at all. i would recommd these headphones. i would purchase an add.l pair in the future. again, great"
R3W50A49LXMNZA,2,"This is the third Sennheiser wireless headphones I have owned.  The first two were outstanding, incredible sound, very comfortable and great range.  The headphones with the RS 120 have great sound and I love the rotary controls.  In fact i Don't shut them off, just put them on the cradle and they turn themselves off.  When I want them again, I turn on the sound source, put on the headphones and they automatically come on.  Downside -- the ear pieces.  Both of my other headphones had very cushioned earpieces that were hallowed out in the middle.  These earpieces are hard and will not stay on my head.  I can not bend over without them falling off, sitting still in a chair they will move on my head.  I have tried to buy other ear pieces but can not find a pair that will fit the 120.  Neither of my old pairs will fit as they are bigger.  I am really sorry I bought these even though they had a good rating for inexpensive headphones."
R1IWAJVQIOSXTP,5,"I was looking to purchase some wireless headphones for my aunt who resides in nursing home.  She and her roommate like to watch different tv programs.  This presents a problem because their tv's are right next to each other on top of their<br />closets.  I called Sennheiser and spoke to a rep and explained to him exactly what I was trying to accomplish.  He was very helpful and recommended the rs 120.  This is the only one that would work, because it turns on automatically. The base has a small hole in the back so it can be hung on the wall. I had the maintenance guy put a screw on the wall so we could hang the base low enough for her to be able to place the headphones on it for charging. She is so happy she can watch what she wants, when she wants, without disturbing anyone else.  She can also watch tv late at night without waking anyone else.  She absolutely loves her headphones!!  I don't know if these would be a great choice for listening to music or not, but they are excellent for tv.  The hardest thing was finding a tv with red and white Audio OUT jacks.  Don't confuse this with audio IN.  If you have a digital audio out jack, you can buy a converter to convert it to analog.  I would recommend this product."
R3DNKKT7JW1KI0,4,These head phones are well built and have good quality sound when listing to T.V. Their wireless range is better than I expected and I have not experienced any outside interference. Battery life is very good and they recharge in a very short time . I would recommend them to anyone.
R1HH5Y59LYBDWO,5,"This was a gift from my kids for when I am sitting with my grandsons.<br />With these headphones I can watch my pre-recorded shows with the<br />sound on the tv off and not disturb anyone no matter what time of day or night.<br />I sit 3-4 nights a week, so they get lots of use.<br /><br />Even better is the fact that they are comfortable and the sound is great<br />even though I have my hearing aids off.  The controls are easy to use.<br />The cradle for charging is super.  Just set them on the stand and they<br />are ready for my next viewing."
R2YDBAKCWUIXM6,4,"Having been using these headphones for about 1 month.  The sound is great and so far no static.  I can turn the tv volumn totally down and my husband cannot hear the tv thru the headphones.  I live in a mobile home and can walk to the opposite end and still hear the tv.  I think they're great.  They are my first wireless headphones so I have nothing else to compare them to.  The charging cradle works great.  The only con that I've found so far is that I have a narrow head and if I lean forward, they will fall off. They are not adjustable at all. Works better on more rounded heads."
R15YQ9UF5YGQ9R,5,Sound is crystal clear but  needs a backstrap to prevent headset from falling off when you bend forward. I made one and now everything is perfect..
R3RQTZ1BBMRWVE,1,I haven't been able to make it work it does not work. I follow all the instructions to the letter and does not work.
R3TK52G343ZPXY,5,These headphones deliver a crisp sound and allows me to hear background effects of tv shows that I didn't even realize I was missing.  My family has enjoyed having the tv volume being turned down to a &#34;normal&#34; level again.  My son also wears them with the tv on mute as to not disturb us when watching something we aren't interested in.  Simply a great product that works even better than expected.<br /><br />i
R1V28YW8EJM7E4,5,"These headphones fulfilled what I had been looking for. I wanted to watch tv and not be bothered by noise in the room or watch with the tv volume off but wife could read without the distraction of the tv.<br /><br />These headphones are not compatible with HD or digital tv and must have a fiber optic cable and adapter to make them work but it is all very simple and easy to install and you are up and running quickly.<br /><br />You will need a SANOXY® AGPtek Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adapter, and a AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable, 6 Feet long.<br /><br />Follow instructions and you are ready to enjoy."
RYVI96BG8TPEW,5,"Excellent choice, you can't go wrong. I have 3 pairs. I think this is the best wirless headset you'll find for the money. The performance value of this headset far exceeds the cost."
R2XRRL3NO2IK3O,1,"Never got a chance to use the headset. It came all busted up in shipment?? Returning it seemed simple enough, I'll find out in a couple of weeks?"
R17D8VLNCD9MF2,5,"This is a great product, I am able to listen to it even off of my ears if I am laying down, I just place is near my head and it does not bother anyone else with the noise from the TV.<br />It was easy to set up and so far I have had no problems."
R10HJBVYFFD4C,4,"This is one item i should have bought a long time ago.  Works great with my home theater, hooks up to my pc nicely, and i've used it with my apple products as well. It will work with many other devices, its pretty flexible.<br />The only issue i have is it sometimes gets static reception.  I expected this a little, and i'm not incredibly concerned about it, as i think my hair interferes with it, but at times it gets static when i'm 10 feet away from the transceiver.  I don't need to adjust the channel knob very often - once its tuned properly the static will come and go.  Most of the time its faint and you'll barely notice it.  Be aware that its not flawless, and you will experience some static reception, otherwise sound quality is great, and it serves its purpose well!<br /><br />This product is rechargeable when mounted on its base which is great as well."
R24MTN50CXUU0M,5,"We only have a single TV in our house and its not in the bedroom.  And I'm hard of hearing.<br />When my wife had two surgeries this summer,  she spent  lots of time being confined to the bed with only her ipad as a reader.  My having the tv on in the other room really irritated her senses,  so we bought this great set of head phones.  Now, she can have the silence she requires and I can turn the tv up as loud as I like.<br />Also,  when I move around the house,  out on the porch,  or out in the driveway,  I can listen to the evening news - which seldom needs viewing.  This is a win - win solultion for the both of us.<br />I would recommend these to everyone."
R2S8Q77QPZ4XK6,4,"It works really good ,but it's not the most comfortable one I have ever had on and if you move around any at all it falls off your head and I have a big head... For just setting and watching TV it's fantastic, you just couldn't do any playing with the kids, dog, or wife while doing so..."
R1ZTAV0O30EF52,5,We already had a pair of these headphones and have been very satisfied with them.  They have great sound and one can walk very far from base and still hear perfectly.
RLMW6VACIJZ2I,5,"I am somewhat hearing challenged, and wake up early compared to the rest of the family. I put these on and no one else knows the tv is on in the morning. They are very comfortable, and the sound quality is great also!"
R1FB4FAI6HAFRJ,4,"Excellent product, great performance for the price . Brand is comparable with the more recognized ones. My husband loved it!"
R1SDGAE7POHY1G,5,Works like I had hoped. Highly recommend this product. Easy set up. Performs beyond expectations. Also keeps background noise out.
R3VCIAPA3YMETK,1,"base was not working on delivery, likely a defect. However i missed the return window and thus stuck with it"
R2MG943DBYC6Y6,5,Changing my original review. Learned how to keep them from losing signal. Keep volume up on TV. Turn off speakers if you want on TV settings. We found if volume too low on TV headphones think it is turned off and headphones will power off. We have had two sets a couple of years now and use them alot. Very pleased since we figured out the the issue.
RRR7AIH0OXT4T,5,"I've been using Amazon for years and never write reviews. This thing made me want to speak. I think these headphones are phenomenal. I got them to play videogames and they do the job. I always get the cord tangled around my chair or forget I wear them and stand up, so I have been through many pairs. To have cordless ones is just so much of a relief. And they are very comfortable to wear. They have foam all over, not just the on the ear pieces - look at the pic and you can see the foam on the band too. And the sound is great. I didn't read the manual, I just looked at the picture on the first page of the instruction booklet and hooked it up. It's very easy for a techy. With headphones on, I walked out of my room into another room about 12 feet away from my PC and was still able to hear it perfectly. So cool!<br /><br />*One thing to be aware of is that after a certain amount of time with no sound, they will drop connection. This will cause a sudden stream of static to come on the phones. Seems to be a power saver feature. I experienced this when I was just on the comp with them on after finishing music. I left them on because they were so comfortable and WAM a bunch of static came on. I then clicked something to make a sound and the static went away. So I advise you to take them off when not in use, no matter how fun it is to wear them.<br /><br />Also the charge rack is awesome. Just lay them on it when you're done and it charges. I am having a blast with these headphones!"
R22RM4Z4M4ZNS,5,"Fidelity is very good.As noted they will fall off when bending over,<br />but they fit well.I will replace the rca ends with a 1/8&#34; stereo plug. (I know how to solder)<br />They sit in the cradle easily to re-charge.If I go into the next room they may lose signal for a second<br />depending on angle but it is minimal.(They are wireless )"
R1Q4MEJ7NS1OZP,5,"Before I bought this product, my wife would suffer me to falling asleep with the blaring TV.  Now I can have PEACE AND QUIET with the TV on silent and she can listen to the volume as loud as she wants.  MY WIFE AND I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
R1AGVJ28ZCFZC4,5,"Great product - works fine. Just make sure it sits in the re-charging cradle, when not in use, so that batteries are properly recharged."
R3NLU0S1QPBR6G,3,I have the RS130 and RS140 headsets and the ear pads on the Rs120 are not as comfortable as my other two sets. The sound quality is still good but not as good as my other two sets. They are great for th grandchildren.
RXS03X17L9AS5,5,i bought this so i can watch TV while my wife sleeps.  but the sound is so incredibly clear that i use this all the time...i am able to hear the words clearly.  i will buy another headset for my wife so we can both use the headsets when watching TV.<br /><br />easy to set up.  many people have reported hissing...I have not noticed any.  battery life is very long.  i don't leave it on the charger all the time...i want to run down the battery before recharging.  the cords are also long so you are not limited as to where you can position the transmitter.  the headset is a little bulky...wish it was smaller and lighter.
R10V84FOZVRJCG,1,I just got this and the power charger won't snap into the base.  It was very frustrating trying to force it in.  I am returning it.
R1YF3FM2X7IXYJ,3,"I purchased these headphones so that I could watch TV while my kids studied, so the TV wouldn't distract them.  They work great with my TV and were easy to install.  I would have given 5 stars, but I was disappointed with Amazon's price guarantee.  I liked my first set so much that I decided to buy a second set.  I originally purchased the headphones for $85.82.  Three weeks later when I put a second set in my cart they were priced at  $65.55.  Because many retailers guarantee pricing for 30 days, I contacted Amazon for a price adjustment of the difference.  Amazon only guarantees prices for 7 days."
RJLIS0GVC5QKB,5,"The first set I received wouldn't charge fully. Return was very efficient and easy. The second set I received works flawlessly, has great clarity, and great range. Highly recommend!"
R1JPK17XKAX6I4,5,These headphones were recommended by someone who owns same brand and he was right.  For a very reasonable price they have performed almost flawlessly.  Highly recommend.
R8QWWK7X4PSE0,3,"I have used this head phone for a couple of weeks now to be able to give an accurate review fo the system. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a high rating due to the following facts: 1- The head phones do not hold a charge for long. 2- Subsequently, it makes the system subject to static feedback as has been discussed earlier by other reviewers. 3- You cannot place the stand near a wireless hub or you will have a very narrow band to receive a signal through. 4- The distance is a disappointment. My kitchen is about 20 feet away and the head phones begin to display static even at that distance. Again, this is probably due to the fact that the head phone stand is about 6 feet from my wireless tower. Summary: you may want to look to another brand or ???  Boyd"
R2Y9RMG42GJ1G0,5,"So far so good. I just got this item and I have to say it works great. The sound is excellent. I have to admit, I have only used this for 1 day so this is just my initial feeling. as the days/month/maybe even years pass, I will update my comment. But all is good so far."
RNYNYF31HU7H1,5,I have one for my hubby and one for me. Works great for late night movie watching. Sound quality is really good too!
R3F7S9H1J04349,4,"The unit arrived timely. It was easy to install. The price was comparable to other units, maybe a tad less. But it doesn't fit my husband's head snugly and when I mute the TV, I still hear it thru the headphones even when they are on his head."
R2MOGQH236SHC7,2,"I purchased the RS120 headphone within the past six months. I also have a Sennheiser RS130, which I purchased 3 years ago.<br /><br />The RS130 has better volume (it can play louder) and it has much better range (it maintains a clear connection from a greater distance). Additionally, it is more comfortable to wear than the RS120.<br /><br />The RS120 frequently crackles with distortion when I simply turn my head, although I am less than 10' away from the transmitter.<br /><br />I love the RS130, but would never buy another RS120."
R3PYXZN748IWI4,5,"I am partially deaf, and have been using a competitive product for five years.  The foam earplugs had to be replaced frequently, and the fit wasn't perfect.  My audiologist said this was a product that several of her clients used, and recommended highly.  I heartily agree!  The sound is wonderful, and the over-the-ear headset is very comfortable.  I'm hooked on Sennheiser."
R3UI4JG9B2LLUY,5,"I bought this set for my father-in-law and he loves his headset. We live on a farm and many times Grandpa will be watching sports or the news and suddenly remembers to get the mail. He leaves the headset on and jumps in the old golf cart and drives down the hill, still listening to the show while he gets the mail. Great reception! He used to buy those TV ears headsets but they were uncomfortable and he had to keep replacing them. But the Sennheiser is still going strong."
R3RKCQD9VNG71B,5,"I absolutely love the Sennheiser RS 120. I have three transmitters now. One is for the Living room TV, one is for the bedroom TV and one is for the Office computer. If Sennheiser offered these with more than 3 transmit frequencies I would no doubt own more of them. The sound is great and I can wander from room to room without losing the signal. I will eventually buy another headset because I'm down to only 4 now. If you continually drop them, which seems to be common for certain members of my household, they do eventually break. But overall they are fairly rugged. Maybe Sennheiser will see this review and give me a free headset!!!"
RSEG10LYA7XYL,5,"My husband likes to stay up late and watch TV very loudly. No longer, since he now uses the headphones. Blissful sleep!!<br />The only complaint I have is that we received no paperwork with the unit. We would have liked a receipt, and a chance to buy a warranty on them."
R2DDVFYN31ZR72,5,"Surprised again by the great quality I find on Amazon. Because of the long term hearing injury I have lost a significant amount of my ability to enjoy the high fidelity sound range offered by my HGTV. I have tried other sound enhancement devices from TV buds to headsets with limited and painful pleasure. When the time came to replace the batteries in one of my two devices I decided to check around to see what  was available.<br /><br />The specifications on the Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle seemed very realistically stated. My purchase arrived on time and in good condition and in less than five minutes I was enjoying the best sounds I've heard in years. The headset was extremely comfortable and with easy controls on each earpiece that allowed me to create a level of sound that I have been missing for years. Stereo sound for the first time, became a wonderful first time experience for me.<br /><br />I like to purchase things on Amazon because I know that I get the best prices and if I have miscued or over estimated a products capability I know that I can return it without a hassle."
R33KG6OAJC5JQ,4,The rechargeable batteries are the best. The direction are little skimpy.  Sound quality excellent. The Recharge capability happens very quickly.
R2KWI10YSLAPIT,4,"Good headphones. Decently comfortable fit (I don't necessarily have a large head, either).<br /><br />They retain the sound quality very well. The low end of the headphones is also very nice. I enjoy getting a small thump from the bass especially when using headphones.<br /><br />However, there is the disadvantage of having the tuning dial directly underneath the volume dial. Additionally, these headphones bleed sound to a large extent. I bought them with the intention of using them in the office, but I can't quite &#34;jam out&#34; as loud as I want due to the noise bleeding.<br /><br />Overall, fantastic value, but the only reason to lose a star was the noise bleeding issue alluded to previously."
R3RGNC0WJ13LRX,4,"I purchased these to help eliminate road noise when I watch TV in our lanai.  Before I bought them I'd have to turn up the TV far too much to hear dialogue on some of my favorite shows so having the headsets allowed me to watch the TV outside without fear of bothering the neighbors.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the headsets are a bit bulky and are actually a tad too big for me even pushed in as far as the headband will allow, which means I get a bit of slippage when wearing them.  But the sound is terrific, the stereo effect is quite clear and I am able to enjoy watching the TV without creating a disturbance for anyone else outside."
R21IFNSIY9ZUHQ,2,These are not the best wireless headphones.  There is static when you listen to them and the range isn't very far.  They slip off my head easily but they are comfortable when they aren't falling off.  Wish I would have bought a different pair but now I'm stuck with them.  I don't even use them really since they're not the great.
R1L9SYNNCIB4UJ,4,We like it most of the time.  The directions do not explain the setup enough in detail.  It also spikes harsh feedback every now and then.  Most uncomfortable when that happens.
RNBFCKDAU93E2,5,So I was a little shaky at first because im buying from a user but the headphones look brand new and they were all wrapped up neat and nicely. The quality is amazing and I plugged in the dock at the far corner of my house and walked to the other half which is pretty big and they worked crystal clear.
R2FGCYAWSXTFEA,2,We live in a condo in the city and the headphones were situated within 12 feet of the base unit. Everything seemed fine for the first 30 to 60 seconds until the signal was lost. Reset the unit several times but achieved the same result. Either the unit was defective or it is not well-suited to urban environments. Will probably try IR headset next time.
R1AV6NBVCSMQZ9,5,"This product works as advertised. The range is very good, sound quality excellent, battery life is very good as well. I like to watch tv and play video games in bed late into the night, this allows me to do this while my wife sleeps."
R25E4YER0NC6RO,5,"This headset is a marvelous tool for receiving true transmission of both music and speech right into your ears! In order not to annoy my husband, I sometimes put the TV on mute and then enjoy TV programs directly from the headset. Tone quality is great - speech is very understandable and I would recommend this to all."
R2MRJ7798ZJ6MP,2,Did not have any real range at all. I couldn't even walk across the room with out the sound stopping.
R3LPKNB04O0FEG,3,Not sure what or why but the headphones are not working.  Am going to trouble shoot later today!  When they worked they were great...in fact this is my second set.
ROYDA5S9GIY7,1,These gave beautiful sounds but no longer work.  They lasted less than 6 months and this seems unacceptable to me.
R16HK9DMZKGXYG,5,"The earphones, although noted to be refurbished, were like brand new.<br />Every thing that was required as a &#34;new&#34; set was furnished down to the batteries and<br />instruction manual.<br />The product came in a very timely manor in perfect condition.<br />I have no qualms about ordering from this vendor or recommending the headphones."
R1E1MQX8CIF7P5,5,"These are great! We use them so we do not create more noise and disturb babies sleeping at home. It lasts a long time without charging, has good range, volume and fit."
R2FID696CEPVBR,5,"I have the RS120 (reconditioned) for the tv in another room, and I am very satisfied with it. I chose the RS 120 (reconditioned) because of its lower cost as I had also purchased the RS170 for the main tv that I watch.  I am hearing impaired. Not only do I use headphones but closed captioning as well. I do not use my hearing aids when using headphones. I have had various headphones for the last 10 years and the RS120 I purchased is very satisfactory for my purposes. One suggestion for improvement: the volume and other nobs on the headphones are hard to distinguish; I suggest the volume control and on/off buttons be slightly elevated. It is very easy to hit the wrong button as they are set up now. Many times I end up taking the headphones off so I can see where the button I need is located."
RUYRSPR7GMQA5,5,Everything they said it would be.  Sound is great and very easy to connect. Very reasonable price. Delivery was as promised. I would recommend this to anyone.
RBXGYQFNMPF75,3,"A little inconvenient in the fact that it has to be turned on or off manually but it works very well.  It is noisy with hiss until it gets a signal from the TV turning on and broadcasting to it, but again, a minor problem.  You quickly adapt to it.  The sound quality is excellent.  The only real complaint is that the headphones are not very well cushioned.  Have not encountered any other problems so I am satisfied otherwise.  Decent price."
RT3GPI5GIH5CE,5,"Ive had these for a long time now, and still work great!  If they ever break I'm buying another pair."
R377QFMZ54OHN7,3,"The sound quality is great but the headphones woun't stay in place when you move your head, they fall forward.  There is no way to tighten the headband to avoid this.  Since this is very annoying I woun't recommend this product."
R10UI96LDGNRQ6,5,"These are a replacement/up-grade for the set that drown in our flood. My husband, a 25 year helicopter pilot, uses these every evening and the truth is, they have saved our marriage (and his life and my sanity). I would recommend this to anyone who has a hearing problem, do also last forever (unless caught in a small household flood)."
RSQZW372J2FL4,3,"I cannot recommend these headphones, solely because of the automatic shutoff feature. I use the headphones to listen to my TV while I jog on my treadmill. I have no complaints about the quality of the sound for the price. However, you must keep the volume of the sound up above a certain level or the headphones will automatically shut down with nothing but loud static. It is then somewhat of a pain to get them working again. I usually turn up the volume on my TV all the way and they will start again - but then you have to turn the volume down again to a reasonable level. If you are watching a movie and there is a brief lull or quieting in the sound - as happens not infrequently with most movies - you are in danger of an automatic earphone shutoff. To avoid this, you must keep the sound up to an unpleasantly loud level - that is not a good idea with earphones, as I understand it can lead to eardrum damage over time.<br />Update : Since I wrote this review, I have learned that if I turn up the sound on my TV as loud as it will go, and then use the headphone control to adjust the volume, the cutting out problem is largely eliminated. Therefore I have adjusted my review from one star up to three stars. However, the earphones still cut out if you pause the TV volume for a couple of minutes, for example when you want to talk to someone or get up to do something."
R3UAS7RWSH6TK5,5,Recently lost 80% hearing in my left ear and had to turn the TV up so loud to hear anything. Dawned upon me to buy some headphones so I could hear clearly and searched for awhile for ones at a reasonable price with good sound and reviews. LOVE the Sennheiser RS 120!<br />The sound is fantastic (actually makes it seem as if I can hear in both ears) and price was fantastic too. Would highly recommend.
R12TSU2Q6GV07D,4,"These headphones sound pretty decent, and are comfortable, but can not be used too far from an outlet (as the transmitter is not portable). I may have to buy some kind of portable transmitter for it, if not, a whole new pair wired headphones for my music on my iPhone, when I'm not close to my home. Not a bad buy however."
R9HF0A0PA32V2,4,I received Sony headphones as a gift purchased from Amazon.  It produced static when connected a plasma TV.  Rather than returning them I use the Sony upstairs on another TV.  They work fine.<br /><br />After reading numerous reviews I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 from Amazon.  Directly out of the box the headphones worked beautifully on a Panasonic plasma TV.<br />There's a tiny frequency selector switch on the face of the transmitter/battery charger.  Just find a suitable frequency and you're good to go.<br /><br />The downside which prevented me from giving the Sennheiser five stars.  Unless you reverse the phones on your head they will easily slide off.  That's a nuisance.  I also wish they had used metal instead of plastic on size adjustment.
R38Q9DCWU2BDRR,4,"I would have given it a 5 star rating except it occasionally \\""crackles\\"" and has an occasional hiss, although it was not bad enough to sent them back to Amazon. The sound is pretty good otherwise. I just wish it didn't have the distortion."
R3S2ANCHKTH3HV,4,"These headphones have been great for my husband. He can watch TV while the rest of the the house sleeps. The headphones do get a little warm but he just props them higher on his head. We have satellite TV and DVD player and have not been able to connect the earphone through all of these devices, only the TV. It very well may be possible but we haven't figured it out. Also he can walk around the house and hear the TV, he doesn't have to stay in the same room. They are very convenient and we are happy with the product."
RJGHITLTNS1CI,5,"Headphones are used only for TV viewing and has a nice tone. It is light weight so no head-aches after looking at long movies. It is so easy to recharge,just sit it on rack and the whole unit is so modern looking and looks great on top of TV. The Sennheiser wireless headphones replaces our old Radio Shack wireless headphones that were very old and finally died. We just love leaving a room and still hear the TV wearing the headphones so we don't miss what is going on. My wife is waiting for her old wireless headphones to die so she can get one like mine. Great product."
R3MNJ0MGHSGXN4,5,very happy with this product. lightweight and great sound quality. much better than a similar sony headphone. only drawback is that you have to remember to turn it off
RZRNKORFUUXHX,5,"The product was delivered on time and bubble wrapped for protection. After reading other reviews I decided to purchase the Sennheiser  RS120 Over-Ear Wireless Headphones. I bought them for watching TV in the evening. After unpacking I pluged in the power cord. And the cable to the 70 inch Vizo flat screen TV. I powered  on the head set and put them on, adjusted the volume in less than three minutes. I can walk anywhere in the house and the sound is wonderful. I also own tv ears these are much more confortable and I do not have to be inline of sight of the receiver to have them work. The freedom to walk around and listen is great. I would recommend the RS120 to anyone for watching TV."
R14M016VKB8UTG,5,I love these headphones.  They work great for listening to t.v.<br />The only problem I had was hooking the head phone up to my flat screen.<br />If they don't work then plug them in to your DVD box and voila!
R2CZX0A7L8IWG2,5,"Best headphones I ever owned. The sound quality is better than my stereo's!<br />I can even wear them outside with only a little hissing now & then.<br />The only con is they fit loosely on my small head, making bending over tricky."
R2IYWN6YRAT5M0,5,Had them 2 months now and they are great.  Can watch tv with sound while the wife sleeps undisturbed.<br />The charging station is great.  Hooking it up is easy but the instructions are lacking.  Tried hooking it to the tv but only to find out you hook it up to the cable box
R1Y2V4Y3KOTT4Z,5,I also have purchased this product for others and have recommended to some more.  The only problem I see is connecting the power cord to the charging unit.
R33O28YGYDAOHR,5,"These were purchased to replace a set of RCA wireless headphones that gave up the ghost after several years of use. Having read all the reviews on Amazon and going to the Sennheiser website for more information, I was somewhat reluctant to purchase these and was just going replace the RCA with RCA (they worked great while they lasted but, were somewhat heavy and the headband did not adjust). So I took the chance and bought the RS120 ( the sound produced is far better than the RCA's). Unlike others I had no problem with setup, no problem with hissing ( no matter where I am in the Apt), virtually no problem whatsoever. My only complaint would be that the ear pads are flat (don't cup the ear) and if you move your head to fast they will fall off, otherwise perfect. YMMV."
R1D826J05E6PN8,4,"Works pretty good! I wanted a wireless headphone to use in my hot tub which is located in a separate building outside of my master bedroom and it works perfectly out there. I had to turn up the volume on the tv there and was concerned that the neighbors could hear it too loudly so thought I'd try this. It worked fine, I did buy one from Costco and was not satisified with it as it would not go the distance. I also use it when I vac/mop the floors, yeah I do that cause I'm retired and my wife is still working, and it works great! I would recommend it."
R3JW357MM7CLZC,3,Very pleased with the range and quality of reception;  gave the headphones a 3 because of the loose fit.  I probably have what would be considered an XL hat requirement and these headphones are still rather loose.
R7H10NJ3KUVXP,5,Will check headphones tomorrow but they look great.  WE  have a set AND NEED ANOTHER since our tvs speaker are poor quality
R2MPKU1XXRNVU6,5,"Initially after reviewing Reviews I was worried, but optimistic.  We love these headphones.  Just one thing should have been noted in the docs: that if you change the volume through the headphones to nothing for a few minutes, like pausing a video does, a loud hiss comes out of them!  A web search turns up that you must undo the pause and then change the volume level at the remote, and the hiss goes away, back to normal operation."
R127V0CLQUJ8YH,5,"I bought these headphones 8 years ago and they are finally crapping out on me.<br />I've abused these, notably around the volume/channel dials.<br /><br />The speakers still work great. Signal strength is good above the threshold, which is very quiet. The on-board batteries still work for an entire work day and the charging station still functions.<br /><br />So what to expect from a dying system?<br /><br />You can expect the left/right to go out first. The balance appears to be centered approximately between the volume/channel buttons. Fiddling with them can get it back but then you have to adjust the volume or the channel, located on the base.<br /><br />Time or perhaps physical strain has warped the charging stations cradle. I have to make sure it's balanced on correctly so it charges.<br /><br />Its filthy because I have simple forgotten about both headset and base and absent mindedly finger near my ear whenever the sound isn't right. Spit polish would do wonders but these will find there place in Silicon Heaven before that happens.<br /><br />Basically I'm going to buy another set identical to my current set.<br />Thank you Sennheiser.<br /><br />John W"
R2Q5CYGBI8AOAU,4,"I use this for watching TV. I have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good although an annoying click is experienced from time to time. This may be attributle to the source volume set too low. There is room for improvemrnt in the location of the tuning and volume controls although one can get used to it as one uses it. I have used similar devices in the past and experienced inumerable LED failures, which fortunately I have been able to repair, but i spent too much bench time on it and finally dumped it."
R17MTCK8XV9MVO,4,Not a great fit for slimmer heads. Reception great even when you are in another room from where TV is.
RALS3VRN8EH5Z,4,I bought these for my wife so she could listen to TV shows with disturbing the rest of the house.  She likes them.
R3R8HBORJRLSGF,5,Outstandimng reception and allows me to go outside around the house and the pool.  i would recommend the purchase to my friends.
R2UPSA3A90D5NC,4,I've seen the other reviews. Yes if there's no sound it goes to static - so turn it off when the TV is on mute or turned off. Even so when you turn the sound back on the TV the static goes away and the sound returns. I have no problems anywhere in my house. It is crystal clear for me right out of the box. Very comfortable.
R2Z9C7KUBQNLOK,5,Got a set for my mother in a nursing home so she can watch TV in her room without bothering her roommate. Then got another set for my RV so I can watch TV after my spouse goes to bed. Can turn the volume of the TV to mute and still hear with the headsets.
R2JL0FOMPAVEJV,2,Headset does not adjust for a woman's head.  It is constantly is falling off if I look down or up.
R33F8M2RBEGTKR,5,"My husband spends many hours watching tv, sometimes through his eyelids as he naps. But if I would turn the tv off, he would wake up. This has been a great solution. We had tried another brand and there was too much static. These have a good sound quality. His only complaint has been in warmer weather that his ears would get a little too hot after wearing them for a while. Now that the weather is cooler, he hasn't been bothered by that. Great product!"
R3ANMGF3ZMIGN2,2,"I have the headphones for few months.I do'nt like them.<br />Noisy, it does not have a clear voice.<br />Definitely not the quality I expected from a Sennheiser product..<br />."
R2F9O0M04QZXEC,5,It does exactly what it says it will do; it's very easy to use and the sound produced is terrific.
R24SSLJSJZVOJ,5,"My Daughter recommended this brand of wireless headphones to my Wife and I as we both have degree's of hearing impairment.  Though<br />not severe, it's enough to make understanding conversations on television without turning up the volume on the set to an uncomfortable<br />level. The Sennheiser RS120 (which my Daughters Husband uses) is incredible.  The clarity of speech on television whether drama, sports or news is unbeliveable and is a quantum leap in enjoyment.  My wife uses hers especially when walking on the treadmill.  Now she doesn't have to blast us out of the house to get good sound above the noise of the treadmill.  This is the best investment we've made in a long time.  It's not just the volume that you can tune up but the quality of the sound from the RS120....It's Great! You can also leave the room<br />(for whatever reason) and not miss the dialog of what you were watching."
R2JL04NV8JBM8C,4,I bought these so that the speaker volume of our TV was low [!] enough for my wife's comfort - she has no hearing loss.  The only problem is that they are a bit loose since the headband is not adjustable. I would like them better if they fit more snugly.
R2K6663QJUK0JU,5,"SO nice for when my hubby wants to watch TV at night and I want to sleep! I highly recommend these, sound is great and he has no complaints!"
R3IGI4WDU0QY0H,5,Tried many wireless brands of wireless headphones but none compare with the comfort and quality  of Sennheiser--I don t hear to well and they open up a whole new world for me for enjoing television--I have recommended them to many friends who feel likewise--kinda sorry they discontinued RS140--but these are almost as food--
R2QE6PLDJLNM3K,3,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 Headphones to watch TV without disturbing other people in the house while they were sleeping. I bought them refurbished on Amazon so they were significantly cheaper than new. The paperwork from Sennheiser is horrible! No explanations on how to hook up to your TV. I have a Samsung LED TV. I contacted Samsung about how to hook up the headphones to the TV. Hardly any help. While Samsung stated it was possible they could not provide assistance other than saying it was possible but without being there looking at the setup it was impossible to help. So I researched the internet, and the amazon web site and finally after 1 week of trying different ways to make it work, I figured it out. I get sound from the TV channels, the DVD, the Smart Hub applications etc...The sound is good, the distance is good the only thing that made this a pain was lack of documentation in hooking the headphones up to make them work, otherwise I would have rated them higher. If you need suggestions on how I did it and if you have a Samsung LED TV I might be able to help. Send a message and good luck!"
R1VHIJA5Q9UIL6,5,"I bought the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones despite the very negative reviews because of the stated bad hiss, pops, buzz, and hums in the head phones. I come to find out, it is not the headphones. When I brought them home to test I first charged them properly for 24 hours as the manual requests. I then hooked them up to my TV cable box in the master bedroom and immediately got very bad hiss - pops - buzzes and hideous noise on the head phones. I thought to myself I should have listened to the bad reviews and was ready to take them back. I tried all three frequency positions on the transmitter and on each setting moved the \\""tuning\\"" wheel on the head phones back and forth to try and get rid of the constant noise. But no luck all three frequencies were really bad couldn't hear the TV program. I then took the entire system and hooked it up to the TV cable box into the kitchen. AND VEOLIA!!! PERFECT AUDIO! No hiss - no buzzes - no pops - no hums - no noise. Nothing but a perfectly CLEAN audio from the TV.<br /><br />The problem all of the bad reviews were experiencing was their TV or cable box or something in that room where they were hooking the headphones up were experiencing interference from their TV or a wireless phone or dirty power or something that was causing the bad audio. IT IS NOT THE HEAD PHONES FOLKS.<br /><br />I then took them over to my Mom's house,(who I bought them for)and hooked them up and PERFECT CLEAN AUDIO AGAIN. No problems.  I bought these head phones for my 93 year old Mom who lives with my sister and is hard of hearing. She would watch TV in her room and not turn up the audio on the TV for fear it would bother my sister. So she would watch the TV in dead silence. You should have seen her face the first time I put the head phones on her. It was like a deaf person that could hear for the first time.<br /><br />So folks .... these head phones WORK PERFECTLY. If you experience noise on them when you hook them up, then you have a problem in your house. Hook them up somewhere else and test them again. The problem is NOT the headphones. Thank you SENNHEISER!<br /><br />My Mom is enjoying TV again and is ecstatic. Oh by the way .... I first bought the JBL Wireless Headphones for my Mom but the volume could not be turned up past normal hearing levels. My Mom needed them a little louder and the Sennheizers did provide that and room to spare."
R1WT8HGHI2ZSID,5,A friend informed us of this product.I got a very good price on it when I purchased it.My husband can finally hear what they're saying on TV especially when the actor is whispering.
R29X2GL5SCZD1L,4,"We had some trouble with the setup--which seems to be pretty common since Sennheiser includes extra instructions for plugging in the power cable to the charging base.  It took four people working on it to get the plug in correctly but now the system is working well and my 84 year old father is hearing movies and tv much better and the ambient volume can be lower.  So, once setup, this is a great solution for people with hearing loss and those who are watching with them."
R3V3GUZD3IVC1Q,1,"WORST OF THE WORST - THAT I HAD THIS IN THE LIFE!  !  !  !  !  !  !  !<br />WHAT IDIOT AND THE MORON MADE THESE EARPHONES! ! ! !<br />I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AND MY EARPHONES ARE ALREADY IN THE GARBAGE BIN FOR A YEAR! ! ! !<br />1-In 15 minutes - ears hurt and sweat.<br />2-fall down from the head. For whom you did them? - (Probably for bears in a zoo! ! ! but not for people! )<br />3- Noise in the headphones - for the price - $82.<br />4 - there is no isolation (hear everything who nearby are).<br />5-After o 2 months of light use - earphones work only for 30 minutes and then you have to charge for 24 hours.<br />6-Sennheiser ,Where is reliability?<br />(they worked only 7 months).  BRAVO!!! BRAVO!!! BRAVO!!! KEEP THE MONEY AND NERVES! ! ! !<br />NO! ! ! NO! ! ! NO! ! !"
RB940TYZ8V7ET,4,Great price and reception. Wish I could adjust the head force better. And the pad where the battery is keeps falling off.
R16TPBHTCW7EI0,5,These are great.  my 94 year old mother has them and she can walk down a long hall and still hear through them
R9PB8NQ02CAFB,4,"After all the reviews I've read, I decided to give them a try and figured if they didn't live up to my standard I'd just return them. I've had them for a little over two weeks now and I'm very happy with them. At first the whole static hiss you hear is alarming but once you find the sweet spot you'll be set. The trick is it raise the TV volume and not the volume on the headset too much, the hiss become almost non-existant. For a pair of wireless headphone, hissing is normal, you can't really complain but they receive clear crisp sound and are comfortable on the ears for long periods of time. Range is great, I've been able to play in the yard with my dog and still hear the show I was watching without delay or interference. My phone or any of the many electronics I have don't interfere with the reception either. One thing is they will slip off you head if you aren't careful and stare straight down. Overall I'm pleased with these headphone and have no doubt I will get a lot of use out of them."
R13F8FFINBUMSF,4,it works.  I purchased this item for working out (treadmill/rowing)...it's not leather cover though so you have to clean it accordingly.
R2AK5YDA93PU0Z,1,"I've used these 120 wireless headphones for years.  I was interested to see what improvements had been made and I needed another pair so I ordered these. However, rather than improving them the latest model is no comparison to the old one.<br /><br />The tuning is absurd. It is very delicate and is hard to get exactly right. I have got it exactly right and then turned my head, the<br />result was static in the headphones. Absurd.<br />The old ones I could wear for hours.  The new ones start to hurt the ears after an hour.<br />The old could be adjusted for right/left ear balance. They left this off the new model. Idiots.<br /><br />I will be sending these back. I bet I could get a better pair for a cheaper price from Radio Shack."
R3ST0FKXWWFDWU,4,"In its second year, still going in great guns. Works great. Allows me to indulge into those late night all-to-myself TV/netflix time. The controls are at odd place causing sometimes to go out of the setting but it is nothing."
R18B1DQNWII69F,5,My elderly mother needs the TV turned up loudly and it drives me crazy.  She also watches TV during the day which I don't do.  Now we are both happy.  I can mute the sound so I hear nothing but she can wear the headphones and adjust the volume to a level that she can hear.  We are both very happy now.
R1WX868RFJZYKN,1,I am very knowledgeable with electronics as a retired Engineer for Lucent Technologies.  2 of the 3 transmit units do not work. Angry but do not want to bother returning them.
R3G1FVXA1Y3GA1,5,I purchased this to listen to tv while I work on other things that drown out the sound of the tv.  I found I had to have the tv volume way up and still could not hear it well.  This works great.  The headphones are the open air type so I still hear the other noise but it is blocked out somewhat.  The sound quality is good.
RRX3NR5DWOL4U,5,This Item is the only way I can listen to most movies on the television.  It is wonderful!!!! Don't leave home without it.
R11UKOUVRHU5M1,5,"I bought these for my father to listen to the TV so the rest of us didn't have to listen to it at its highest volume.<br />I tried them myself and they work great. No static and very clear, crisp sound. I didn't expect a lot since they weren't one of the more expensive sets so I was  pleasantly surprised.  The dial is very sensitive so you barely have to touch it to adjust the volume. The only problem is sometimes my father forgets to wear them.<br />LT"
R2CJJAGCLG50WY,4,"I'm not deaf, but I've had requests from aircraft flying over my house to turn down my TV volume.  These headphones connect easily to my TV (or anything else you want) and allows clear, understandable audio for those of us who say &#34;Huh?&#34; a lot.  The down side?  I do get some interference, probably from my computer; but it's not a show stopper.  It also has great range!"
RN0PR9C5IRLVL,3,"I’ve been using the headphones regularly for over six months and it works ok. The headphones are comfortable. I plug the unit into the headphones output on my A/V receiver and listen to music and TV. However, I have to set the volume on the receiver at about 85% of its maximum to get a reasonable volume in the wireless headphone. Using this level to drive my speakers would drive everyone out of the house. As a comparison, conventional unamplified headphones give me a reasonable volume at about 40% of maximum. I tried inserting an adjustable 12dB line amplifier between the receiver and the headphones, but this made things worse by causing more hiss and distortion.<br /><br />I think the automatic gain control in the headphones is causing most of these problems. It would be nice if there was a switch to turn the AGC off.<br /><br />I was expecting something better."
R3GJ27GTFIDJM5,4,"I was really pleased with these headphones but as many others have stated, they do make your ears sweat. Simple solution though. Change these to around the ear phones using these.... beyerdynamic EDT 250 V..... sold on amazon, just do a search. Although they are made to fit Sony MDR V-6 phones they will fit on these nicely.<br />  Remove each side of the RS120 pads by twisting a little to the left on each side. Remove all the foam pieces until all you have left is the plastic grids for each side. In the beyerdynamic kit there are two fiber like oval washers, throw em away.<br />Just lay the black, round foam piece on top of the plastic grid and install the earpads by stretching the lip over the plastic grids. This will hold the round, black foam piece in. WOW, HEAVEN !! So much more comfortable. I would have given these headphones 5 stars if I wouldn't have had to do the modification."
R1MJRVFW7SEIX,2,Defeats the purpose of private listening by leting the sound scape because they are not sealed. They need a padded ear cover to sustain the sound.
R1T2Q8L1EP8LP1,5,"What a great quality product the other pair , probably the first set I purchased for him, wore out..these have a nice metal on top and should not  wear out like others did..The plastic cracked and would stay on his head.."
R2PM6X38JFPFUE,4,Arrives on time as described. After five to ten minutes of adjustent I pluged it in to the output jacks in rear of cable box. Voila. Success. Try it you'll like it.
R3NBLB8XVV9RPG,5,"At 83+ with double hearing aids, trying to listen to the British dramas  on PBS, or my favorite Pandora music stations, was more aggravation than delight..  My wife now has a set for herself, and friends that came for dinner left with ordering information for their very own 'ears' .  An improvement would be to make the use of the charging terminals on the transmitter a mite larger to make charging and storing two sets of headphones easier.  Also, offer a package of two headsets with one transmitter/charger.  Try them--you will understand every word Leonard Cohen sings!"
R3G426A7A23QC6,5,these are rechargeable headphones and I no longer keep my husband awake while I watch a program. They are easy to use and the sound is great. You can walk around and still hear the program. I love them.
R2ASXSET3N5F9L,3,"Designed in Germany so you'd think it all components would work beautifully. While the headphone sound is decent, after use, you are instructed to replace onto the charging cradle. But it takes a foolish amount of fiddling with the headset on the cradle before one can get the contact surfaces to meet(red indicator light turns on)<br /><br />I thought I must be doing something wrong. But all it say is place headset on cradle as if it were a no fuss simple motion.<br /><br />So, whenever my mother is finished watching TV, she has has to drape a pair of heavy woolen socks over the headset in order to get the pressure needed for the contact sources to meet.<br /><br />If not for the decent sound, we'd send them back."
R1A156ISGUMOJ5,5,"This is the first head set I bought that works great.  Easy to set up, had it for over a month, now I don't bother the wife with loud movies or games."
R28A212P528JQ5,5,"This is a fantastic item.  Fine German Engineering (Made in China LOL).  Best sound quality I have ever heard in a wireless headset.  I did have to spend another $25 to hook this up to my TV.  I have a digital audio outlet.  Had to buy box to go from digital to analog.  Beautiful sound, Very comfortable, Like the charging dock.  Buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  Well worth the price.  No need to pay more for a headset."
R2XT8T42J08W5E,3,"It's nice to still hear my show while avoiding frowns from my sleeping girlfriend (and to have the option to jam to tunes while taking a crap), but the quality is poor: Music sounds awful on it, and the earpieces aren't designed to fit securely (there's no \\""cupping\\"" action; they kind of flare out, actually), so if I turn it up, I still bother people. I'm not sure it's worth the price.  It does what it's supposed to, but not well."
ROQMIWL7NI1CP,5,"My old headphones had a horrible buzz, and I knew I needed an update fast. So based on reviews I bought these, and Oh my! The sound is as clear as a bell. No distortion at all and I can hear perfectly well walking anywhere in the house (while preparing food in the kitchen) or outside while gardening. I HIGHLY recommend these. Big plus is my TV had only one outlet and this set comes with a gadget that allows putting both cords into the included adapter so it will fit the one outlet on my TV and works perfectly. Also a larger adapter comes free in the set if your outlet requires a larger one, and even batteries are included. I would give it 10 stars if I could!"
R1OFRLCS9Y58T2,5,"I just plugged my new Sennheiser wireless headphones into my TV and listened to the sound for the first time. The sound quality these things put out is absolutely astonishing! I was watching the movie &#34;Star Trek IV&#34;™, and when the whales started to 'sing' it felt like I was actually in the water with them! Incredible. Definitely worth every penny I paid!"
R2HELCPS4TXMEK,4,"I have had these headphones for about two months now and I love them.  The sound quality is excellent.  They have a tuning and a volume control on the right side ear muff and an on/off switch on the left.  They are very comfortable for extended wear.  I can wear them anywhere around the house, upstairs and down without any loss of signal and have been outside as far as 200 feet and still hear the program but the further away the signal does get weaker with distance.  The headphone rechargeable batteries are automatically charged when they are placed on the base and a red light on the base indicates they are being charged.  When the TV is on a green light on the base indicates there is a signal.  Hookup was effortless, just plug  the transformer into a power outlet and connect the signal cable and it works.  If the tuner is not on the channel, a turn of the tuning knob will get the signal and then it can be left alone.  There is plenty of volume for those hard of hearing, like me, and the sound is excellent.<br />There is only one negative side to these phones.  The muffs are covered with cloth and are flat.  Very comfortable, however a turn of the head to look down and they will easily fall off my head.  I highly recommend this for anyone needing hearing help for TV watching."
R39S41OHF7CT6H,4,"I can watch TV and not disturb my partner sleeping right next to me!!!<br />When others are speaking in room or outside noise I can clearly hear what I am watching.<br />Watching shows Where actors have accents or whisper I can turn up Volume and hear the Dialogue clearly.<br />Wish I the ear pieces were more comfortable, Brother has the $300.00  Sennheiser head phones and only difference I can tell is the ear cone are more comfortable and you can adjust right and left ear, good for me as I have hearing loss in one ear.  Not worth the difference in Price.  I would pay a little more for more comfort.<br />BEST Headphone Value!!!"
R11V1T2BERRLIU,5,This headset sits on top of the tv stand and stays charged all the time. When needed my husband only has to turn it on and hear his favorite tv shows while I hear nothing. I highly recommend it!
RL10KE4EBTGW0,2,"Let me start with the good news :D, :<br /><br />a. Price is good<br />b. Price is good<br />c. Price is good<br />d. Sound is good - Very good - when it actually works...<br /><br />Now let me elaborate on that, the problem I find is it has a &#34;tune&#34; dial and sometimes (most times) you hear interference, it is sort of the price you pay for a wireless product with an FM transmitter.  Now the bad part, is you can be listening to music and you decide to browse for songs, and if you are like me you like good music with good volume, so you are browsing your folders and BAM a loud noise from the deepest darkest location of FM Hell will leave you deaf ... or at least will attempt to.  See in accordance to FC regulations Sennheiser has to shut down the transmission when it is not being used, the sad part is you will hear a loud SHHHHHHH every time it decided to shut down, and it will happen often, there is no way to turn it off, fix it nothing.. it is what it is, the only solution I have found to this is I downloaded a program that does a random sound every 40 secs or so, and it re establishes the link so the death SHHH sound doesn't get me.<br /><br />So yeah.. oh and Sound is good... when it works"
R2JXDBV60I1DE2,1,"Big issues:<br /><br />1. Constant hiss. If you are going to buy these to listen to classical music, forget it. The background hiss never goes away. It is quite annoying. Granted I have lots of electronics very close to my desktop that could cause interference, but so does everyone else.<br /><br />2. The DC charger plug-in is impossible. First of all, no one other than a small child has fingers small enough to plug it into the base unit.Then, a small child would not have the strength that I needed to actually push the plug in far enough to get power to the unit.  (I was apprehensive about breaking the unit by pushing so hard on it.) This  plug-in issue is a huge design flaw. Anyone who thought about it for more than 30 seconds should have caught this issue.<br /><br />3. As noted in other reviews, these are NOT over the ear headphones as advertised. They are on the ear, which does not block out all extraneous sound. And they really are not as comfortable as other earphones I have used.<br /><br />I am 90% certain that I will return these, but I will keep trying to eliminate the hum for a few days. If I do, I will update this review."
RLINNQBTRD4TX,2,"After reading the somewhat genuine reviews of these headphones, I purchased them without hesitation. Unfortunately, I now wish I had purchased another set of headphones. After two weeks of using these, they were already beginning to stretch. The slightest movement downward will cause them to fall off, which is insanely annoying. These headphones were clearly meant for the morbidly obese and mutated gigantic heads since they really never fit my head at all. Trying to get a good signal without interference was impossible. You would always hear a LOUD HISS (Very noticeable, unlike what others have said) and the connection is very difficult to maintain. It means that, again, with just the slightest movement (I really do mean slight as in an inch) will cause major feedback in the sound and FORCE you to relocate to a better position, which isn't comfortable.  If the headset is not in use after maybe three minutes, it cuts off and gives off a deafening feedback-related tone. I don't understand why I can't turn these feature off. I'm looking in to file a lawsuit for this very reason, because let's say you're viewing a Youtube  video or two, decide to look at your phone to answer some texts, then all of a sudden &#34;PPPPPPPPPPPPSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!!!&#34;<br />The end result, they work and have a charger. The headphones and charger are made from the cheapest materials and I would evaluate this at a retail of maybe $35 and no more, however, I paid about $80. It can also be said that my partner can still hear the music and the movies I watch on my computer. This is not appropriate considering I bought these to stop being loud at night to let my partner sleep. What a disappointment."
R1K6XUE6R4306C,5,"This is the second pair of these earphones I have boughten and am very pleased with them. I love listening to my TV with earphones so that I hear well and don't disturb other people, since we enjoy different programs."
R3DSJULDNRXYX3,3,"So when I got the product in the mail I wasn't expecting to have to carry the friggin dock with me everywhere. I wanted the headphones for my iPad so I could watch movies while i cooked and cleaned the kitchen. Well when i got it I found out that in order for it to work you have to plug the cord into the device you want to use and from there you can hear all over the house. Definitely a lot of static. Headphones are definitely quite large, when people come into my home all I hear them say is 'Whoa those are some big headphones'. It does what it is supposed to do though so that's why I give it 3 stars."
R6RPTWV5AAPLK,1,I had to return these headphones because the ear padding is so thin that it feels like a piece of hard flat plastic pressing upon the ears.<br /><br />I do like that the batteries are easily replaced if/when needed and the signal quality is just fine.  Also is the range for the wireless is more than enough for use around the house.
RKD814XO1MB50,5,"Now my 90 year old Aunt can watch TV without disturbing everyone miles around.  She loves them, so I love them (after trying several other lower priced hearing-aid models!)"
R3SBVYLWSBAZZ0,2,"Boy, I must have gotten a defective unit.  Sealed box, but no instructions, but I've had these kind of things beore, so on-line intructions worked. Problem was: left ear unit never worked and had only a static-hissing noise at best.  Am sending them back and reordering since I trust Sennheiser to be better than this."
R2155K7K7IICOA,5,"I purchased these headphones to replace a an older set that didn't have near the range nor the sound quality.  The range on these headphones were about 120' for me (through walls and doors).  The sound quality is also head and shoulders above what I was used to.  I also have a wireless speaker that just happens to be on the same frequency, so that was a real plus - although I don't have the same range with the speaker"
RC5OZLKQ4V7MQ,5,This product is awesome. My husband who wears hearing aids could not believe that he could once again hear every word spoken on the TV. He says that for 5 years he has been mostly lip reading. I didn't even know this. It's so nice to be able to watch TV together without each of us having to compromise our comfort level. I have ordered 3 sets. For both TV's he watches at home and 1 pair for our vacation home. That pair I just gave to a friend so I am now ordering a 4th pair. The price is affordable also.
R254SWM1STT6LH,5,There is always a lot of activity in our house when the TV is on.  With the new headset I can watch the TV and hear the softest conversations that I was not able to hear before.  If I am up at night I get perfect sound on the headset even if the TV has the mute on so no one else in disturbed.  If I have to make run into the kitchen or somewhere else in the house I can continue to follow my program with the headset on.
R2Q8H33GNONVYW,5,These wireless headphones allow me to listen to the TV at a volume most others find too loud because I'm a little hard of hearing.  They provide a connection without static nor wires between the base and the headphones and can be tuned to the signal if necessary. The sound quality is excellent and controllable with a thumbwheel on the earpiece.  There is an on-off switch on one earpiece and the included rechargeable batteries have not run down in all day use yet. The base plugs into a jack on the TV and a wall outlet for power; includes a red light to show the headphones are charging when they are on the base. I like them so well I purchased a second set for use on another TV in another room.
R1M3UYQTU9CI14,5,This is the second one of these I have bought.  The first one lasted 5 years and three moves.  My husband is hard of hearing and when he doesn't have these I think the neighbors can hear what he is watching.  I was going deaf while he was trying to hear.
R3CH85R0KREI5,4,High quality.  My set is about 4-5 yrs. old and still going strong.  Ordered a set for my neighbor recently and she is equally pleased.
R24U7IZ5R6UMZ0,5,"I searched the web for quite some time before settling on sennheiser RS120.  I read many reviews and judged my purchase by them.  The RS120 was rechargeable and had a very easy cradle to sit on.  Other ones had said that they had trouble getting the headphones to fit on the charger. These fit great with no problem.  We had some idea of wireless headphones because we were using some cheap $9.99 pairs and they were ok but continuously needed batteries.  The sennheiser RS120 are perfect for us.  I bought two pair one for my wife also.  I also bought two charge stands so we did not have to share the charger.  This way we do not have to remember which pair has to go on next and it is much easier for us.  They each have their own cradle to sit on now.  We have used them since December 2012 and this is one of the best gifts we ever bought ourselves.  Well worth the money and very easy to set up with awesome sound.  We have our TV,VCR, and UHF player set up to play through them as well."
RTN6LTCALVGU7,5,"I got a good price, was delivered before expected, Extremely easy to connect.<br />The sound quality is amazing. I would tell anyone who looking for such a product about it."
R3ESMC617EKQVL,4,"Love the products ... Have 2: The RS 120 & IS 410 TV... Both new ... But husband would love them more if they were adjustable ... They fall off his head if he's moving around and doing things ... I have lots of long curly hair, So no problem for me ... He's got a small head ... But still loves the sound ... Price is reasonable ... Lightweight & not to bulky like our sony's ... Much better ... He would give them 5 stars if they  were adjustable ;)"
R1WRJRTNFO85DB,4,"Good quality, good reception (Don't need to be much further than 50 feet from the base). Easy charging system.<br /><br />Haven't used it enough to say I love it yet, but so far a 4.5 stars."
R2LS4HVXDD93M6,4,"This system works great. I am a night person, and I can listen to movies, TV or the radio without disturbing the rest of the household. I don;t know yet how long the charge will last. as I have not used it that long."
R2IGYCH588SDS4,4,This item works great for me. I wish it had a tone control however as it gets a little to much bass for my liking. Overall a good deal for a nice price.
R3MI8XMK94LZH1,5,Much lighter weight than the Sony pair I have and the sound is wonderful. They were also easy to tune.
R3SXN90V3TMYDN,5,"This is one of the best makes of headphones I know. Before I buying this one I had bought one of this make, and I am still using it."
R1VN054XUXA52W,5,"I have no hearing problems but love wearing these to watch a TV show.  Every word is clear, as are background sound effects that get lost between the TV & the chair.  They are comfortable and recharge themselves."
R2H7N9XDBRSOCC,2,"I think the idea of the cradle is very good.  The problem that I have is that the headphones slide off if I move my head or bend over, there is no adjustment to tighten them,this is very annoying.  The ear pads are flat and do nto fit well over the ears."
R1M2MUKS7LZBOJ,5,"Wonderful sound and clarity for a headset in this price range. I do not  have the hearing of my youth but, these are some of the best I've ever owned."
RLG9OTURESIPF,5,"I can run from basement, where my TV is located, to second floor, and the sound is still very clear. The frequency can be adjusted to suit your best. It might be a bit more expensive than other wireless headphones, but it is really, really worth it."
R1UNRSM0LAN8S8,1,"I've had a pair of JVC headphones for about 6 years. When it was time to replace, I chose this model. However, after a few uses, I quickly realized these do not stay on your head unless you remain in a fixed position without moving. I live in an apartment complex and use headphones late a night as not to disturb my neighbors. My JVC model allowed me to move around the apartment and never came off. These would with some just basic moving about. They sound quality was good, but that makes no difference if they won't stay on :("
R35WSC1VYM3N2L,5,I purchased these headphones so I can watch movies without waking my toddler son. These are great and pickup all the surround noises from the movie that you are suppose to hear just like in the theatre.
R3YWXRLTCSNG1,5,"Great sound. Easy on my ears, I can use these for a greater time period than any others I have had. Very good distance."
R1G5FLIN7AAUNW,3,When using the headphones I lose the signal during the first fifteen minutes. After that the signal returns and I enjoy the program. I should add the signal is lost when I am stationary.
R3TQB63QRBIQO4,4,Headphones are a necessity for me while watching television . This product along with reading cc makes shows much more enjoyable .
R24LZK0JRWVJ9F,5,"Being hard of hearing is the pits, but to the spouse it is even worse.  The sound is great, can work around the house and yard and listen to news and such by having it plugged into the DVR.  HIGHLY RECOMNEND!"
R30TYOISJ8X3KR,5,Works great whether I'm doing treadmill work or just being a couch potato.  Have had no problems at all with this unit.
R1J6FEHNXWWOZZ,5,The headphones work excellent. RF is perfect when you like to walk around the house and do other things while listening to your TV show. Audio is very clear and crisp.  I would definitely buy another one of Sennheiser RS120 when I get another TV for the bedroom.
R2L2I5328NT7AL,4,"Easy setup and sound quality very good. Earphones are heavy and somewhat uncomfortable, though. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase."
RCQL7BNW57PCU,5,Amazing difference. I didn't realize there was a lot of talk in the background that I was missing. Tried my grandsons and I was hooked.
R2M95VPXNS1R1L,5,I have purchased this item before and it is a fine quality wireless earphone receiver. Great for when your husband wants to watch television and you don't.
R1C8N259KYHXQ5,1,"I cannot believe these headphones have gotten so many 5 star ratings.<br /><br />I cannot get over the humming noise.  It's maddening.  I bought these to wear at my desk at work.  I had an older pair of Bluetooth headphones that had finally given up on me.  I thought I'd go with a bigger name brand and get something that would last a little while.  I can't even sit 2 hours with this humming.  I've tried different stations, I've tried the tuning feature, nothing makes it go away entirely.  This might be better in a home with less electronics around, but NOT for office use.<br /><br />Charging station is nice, that's about the best i can do for this set of headphones.  Don't buy them."
R1QF8584MH3NTW,4,"I chose 4 stars because overall the headset could be more comfortable by design for the same cost and materials.. but as for performance it does it's job.. Now understand that when I use this set I am stationary, and sedentary.. to watch programing on my PC or TV in my office space at home.. I do not expect these to broadcast about the house, or outside.  When I watch programming I expect to be sitting still just as if I went out to wash the truck.. I would not expect to be listening to programming!.. So given reasonable expectations these do the job."
R31GIWI3LBUJFB,5,it works fine and is very easy to use. I am sure that i will enjoy it for a long time.
R1JVTFYR4IJLET,1,My $20 wired headphones sound better than these.  Avoid at all costs. Styling and construction seem good but audio quality leaves MUCH to be desired.
R31BS92C6EE4ZU,5,"I have been buying from Amazon for quite some time and have used the reviews to help me make my decision on every purchase.<br /><br />I always look at the negative reviews first to see if there is anything I should know before buying the product. Also I find that after reading the reviews I look at how many 4&5 stars there are compared to 1&2 stars.<br /><br />For me it is important to add the 4&5 stars and then add the 1&2 stars and find the percentage. If the 1&2 stars is 30% or less of the 4&5 stars then I will purchase the product, even if there are some pretty bad reviews.<br /><br />So with this product I believe there was only 20% negative compared to positive reviews and I found with this low percentage I should be safe.<br /><br />The system worked perfectly again. These headphones are awesome!!! It took me 5 minutes to set them up and 2 minutes to connect them to my TV and using the tuning wheel I had sound within seconds.<br /><br />The sound is clear, clean and crisp. The TV is in the bedroom so I decided to take a walk to the garage, on the opposite side of the house, and show my better half. I walked into the garage and had her put the head phones on and she was impressed.<br /><br />As I walked through the house the sound stayed strong and there was never and distortion or hum. I have wireless internet and phones and no interference. I went outside and the sound was loud and clear.<br /><br />So that night my lovely lady fell asleep and there was a program I wanted to see. I placed the head phones on my head turned up the sound and turned the sound down on the TV and it was perfect.<br /><br />I could hear the show, she could not, and we had a perfect scenario.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product."
R281PL4A4LIYV6,5,These lived up to their purpose. The need for add on items is highway robbery. Just get the headphones with the charger.
R2N9EAHD5M3R8V,5,"Chose to order these headphones to use when my hubby and I watch TV together.  I like the volume higher than he does, in order to clearly hear the quiet parts of TV conversations.  These headphones work perfectly for that.<br />They also are more than I expected.  I can walk away from the TV--even leave the room--to go get something/do something, and still hear every word.  I love that because I tend to run into the den or kitchen really quick and end up missing a key conversation too often.<br />And if one of us wants to watch TV while the other is trying to sleep in the same room, these headphones do the trick.<br />Clarity is great and the wireless feature makes them very mobile.<br />Definitely recommend!"
R2TJQQ5E9PNK4J,4,"I am a fan of Sennheiser products and have been for many years. These headphones perform as described in the Amazon product description. It was a simple plug-in to my TV's audio output jacks and they were ready to go! I shut off the TV's speakers via the menu and turn on the headphones, adjust the volume and enjoy my shows without bothering my wife sitting nearby.<br /><br />The sound quality is as good as the source. The controls are simple to access and use. The headphones are comfortable. The only thing I can say against them is that if you move your head around very much, they will slip off. But if you are sitting relatively still, there is no problem at all. As someone who is used to earphones that allow a lot more freedom of movement, it really only took a little effort to get used to this minor restriction. This is the only reason I did not rate them five stars. I am happy with this product and would buy them again, knowing what I know now."
R3TUDSMJUZRM0,4,I use these headphones while riding my bike and watching tv. They perform flawlessly and I love the fact they're rechargeable. I almost bought the regular battery powered and now I'm glad I spent the extra money.<br /><br />Initially I was a little frustrated with the sound because it wasn't loud enough but with some minor adjustments I had to turn the volume down. That was my error and not the fault of the product.<br /><br />If I had to find something to complain about it would be the fit. These headphones are a little loose on my head but if they weren't I'd probably complain about them being too tight.<br /><br />Without hesitation I would make this purchase again.  I'll let you know if anything changes.
R1JA02OTJAU67F,5,"75% left ear 78% right ear deaf. (Actually high frequency hearing loss)<br />Genetics dictated that I would start to lose my hearing about a year ago and I went from being a huge movie buff to not being to watch TV at all. My wife bought me these for my birthday and I LOVE them! Hearing aids are just no good for TV, no matter how I adjust them or my TV I can’t make out individual voices it just garbles it all together. With these headphones I can hear perfectly and my wife can enjoy the TV as well at an acceptable volume.<br /><br />They are RF not digital, if you don’t understand that before you order them it is your own fault if you don’t like them. That being said these headphones are amazing. just be sure to charge them up all the way before using them. I turned them on right out of the box and had issues getting good volume out of the right side but it turns out a good charge was all they needed.<br />I would highly recommend these to anyone I know."
R2X3ZOA1RGX539,4,"Sound is very good, easy to charge. fits comfortable but it will not stay on your head when you bend over or move your head in a down ward motion. I would recomend it."
R2C26ED8QBF0JD,1,I am very surprised they incorrectly list these as Over-Ear headphones when they are not. They are On-Ear. If you look at the additional images you will see (I wish I had before ordering). This will be my first ever return to Amazon.
R3TSNFGYVRG82F,4,"Headphones have great range, and they have great sound. However, the headphones won't stay on your head. All they need are different earpads."
R2E02TVHVTMYSK,5,"So far so good.  The battery last a long time, works well, clarity is great.  I dislike that if you pause the TV and have the headphones one, it will make this static noise and scare the crap out of you."
R2VZ63T7CLTCYF,3,"my mother did not feel comfortable wearing this compared to a Sony MDR, so i had to return it and buy sony mdr"
R3G1IKY6GQ8ROH,5,"They are working well for me, as now I can hear all words so much more clearly when watching tv."
R3KU908EJ7D8SK,5,Mom says they work wonderfully for listening to TV without her hearing aids. We had to plug into the earphone jack as her VCR/DVD player takes up her other jacks. She hears dialogue very well and she can tune them by herself.
R2PA5P6VUG9G9R,5,"My mom is hard of hearing and blasts the TV volume. With these headphones, she can put the volume up to her comfort level without waking the neighbors. I like that she doesn't have to run out to buy batteries as well."
R2EC959E26Q4RK,5,"We bought two sets,primarily to listen to tv or streamed movies where my wife and i would turn to each other to ask, 'What did they say?'  The earphones are superb in quality and bringing to the foreground the sounds in scenes that we normally would miss.<br />On buying two sets with cradles- Our learning curve and our help.  Initiallly we were going to connect both cradles to tv audio out but a call to Senheiser said that only one cradle was needed as both headsets  work at same frequencies. This worked out well and eliminated of  the interferenced that seemed to occur when both were connected & tuned at same frequency.  The Sennhauser people were very helpful and having that service was deeply appreciated .  Once this issue of how best to connect the two sets was solved and playing with the frequency knob for adjusting, we can leave the room and walk to other end of house (about 40ft), raid the refrigerator and not miss a beat of the sound as the reception stays  excellent. With different 3 channels of wireless frequencies on the cradle, the second cradle has a dual purpose- to charge the earphone and when i want to, can  easily  plug in  to my ipad or iphone for music."
R3QCN46K93Z7O0,5,"I have worn out numerous batteries, because I can walk around my home and not miss a minute of what is being said on TV."
R2KCE145KGLPKN,4,So nice to have the football game on and not hear it!!  Hubby even goes outside by the BBQ and can hear his game!
R33WEA7JOM1A9S,4,"To start let me say I have an IT masters degree, so my proficiency with technology is high. With that said, I needed a solution while my newborn was sleeping to still watch movies, tv, and play games. My wife and I both used these (so 2 bases and 2 headphones) but we actually only had 1 base connected to the receiver. We were able to both listen from the 1 base and that was very helpful. However, having the additional base for charging is helpful. Battery life was good as we always just placed them back on the docks after using them. However, my only gripe was if you weren't facing directly at the base with I had static (only 10' from base w/ line-of-sight). It was at times a bit too much (annoyance) &#34;noise&#34; or &#34;static&#34; in the phones, but I still think it was the best solution at the price point I received it. I now don't use them since the baby is older, but they did serve an important purpose during the time."
R1HMY6H0CDX26C,5,Got these headphones for my father-in-law to be able to watch TV without having the sound up so loud that the neighbors down the street hear it as well!  Very comfortable too...
R1NOIXLWJTOCXI,1,I could never get a clear signal out of the unit. I had two of them and tried in two locations so I doubt it was local interference.
RI2IWOFRXZLEE,5,"As previously said the headset does not fit all skull sizes.  I use it mainly to hear sound from my computer, so quality of sound has not been an issue.  You do have to charge it first before you can adjust it the first time. It has proved helpful to listening in a noisy environment. I'm kind of unhappy that Amazon has had a large price drop on this, since I purchased it recently."
R3U13BI9MZGRM,5,Bought these for my 93 year old Mother to listen to tv and she loves them!!!!!!! Would highly recommend these!!!
R6ZW4WZYI2F93,5,"By far the best wireless headset I have bought, and I have bought many. Love the charging feature and tuning dial."
R3UFJEXVBBNS0N,5,These headphones replaced an older set from Sennheiser. They are lighter and more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The reception is very clear. I use them for listening to movies and music mainly. They definitely enhance my listening experience.
R1MR6HD7WIOT4V,1,Don't ignore the 1 star reviews -- several people mentioned a problem getting the AC plug to fit into the base.  I thought the base would break if I pushed any harder on the plug.  Returned it.
R1X08YLL6OQ521,5,These over the ear headphones are quite comfortable.  The battery lasts many many hours before needing to be charged.  In fact I haven't had them go dead on me-----I do however  rest them on the charger each night.  And best of all----the sound quality is great----I listen to all my TV programs through these headphones.
R1T525BGHX18J8,4,The HEadline says it all. I had the opportunity to Compare to Sony's headphones of similar price and the fact one can changes the batteries on these cinched it. The sound quality is notably better but not profoundly better. The SOnys stay on your head better but seemed to get hotter on your ears after time.
RRFZUMO3OEN0J,5,This was the perfect gift for my husband who suffers hearing loss. I've even used them when he went to bed and I stayed up to watch a show without disturbing him. Excellent product for a low cost.
RXOMYPTOXNLFC,5,They are awesome!!!!  They sound great & I get no hiss.  I can walk to the garage to grab a beer from the outside fridge and still can hear the dialogue or music that I am listening too without interference!!!
RC52XFATSI24N,5,"Convenient, clear, easy to set up. It takes up a little more space than our last attempt at TV earphones, but these are better. The product does what it says it will."
RA6P2UI9NJ8YY,5,These are very clear and comfortable. These are a gift to both myself and my husband. I have trouble going to sleep with TV on and he needs it on to go to sleep. Now we are both happy
R2R2BMTBHO6BW5,5,"These phones work great and are comfortable. They also keep the sound in, my partner Sweet Thang says she can't hear a thing from them while I watch Arnold kick the living donkey kong outta the Predator."
R1IQ4EBP7NIA0O,2,The headphones sounded good and was easy set up.<br /><br />But I had to return them because they would not stay on head while on the treadmill. They would be good if just sitting watching TV and not moving around.
R18FMA9RT0FDVA,3,"The headsets is hard on the ears if worn for more than an hour or so. I sit close to TV, but background noise often interferes with program. It comes and goes and is often very bothersome."
R8MGOX87W4YWX,5,"The only drawback is the headphones are flat rather than cupped, but they give good range and aren't constantly searching for new channels like another pair I had"
R1II7D11GMJ85H,4,"Love the head phones!  Great sound and I can walk all over the house and down<br />the street and the sound and reception is great!<br />The only problem I have with them is when I lean over.... they fall off of my head.<br />I bought 2 sets , one for me and one as a gift for my Mom.<br />She loves the sound, but has the same problem with them falling off when she leans over.<br />I still think they are terrific!"
R7Q4H7C4PQJK,5,"I started off with an RF set, it worked well as long as I was pointing directly at the receiver. This got old fast. Then, I tried a cheap set of RF phones and the reception was better but the sound quality was awful. Finally, I decided to spend a little more and got the Sennheiser RS120. Best money I ever spent. I mean, I can go into the kitchen or the bathroom (which is around the corner and down the hall) and still get crystal clear reception. I'm writing this review in hopes of saving someone else the trauma and headaches that I went through unnecessarily. Trust me, spend a little extra right off, you cannot go wrong with this product."
RWCOHLAID4PSP,1,"Poor sound quality, made my ears hurt after half an hour because they don't fit around the ears. Returned to Amazon right away."
R284GMD4T4K9PF,4,"I love headphones because my husband complains about the volume of the TV all the time. This headset has a pretty good sound quality and it allows for you to tune it until you find the setting that works for you. The volume control is quite good and I like how light weight it is and that is not squeezing your ears. Also, great battery life. I can use it from 9 in the morning till 1 o'clock am and no problem. the battery is holding strong and there's no decrease in sound quality<br />What I don't like is the fact that is too big for my head. I have a pretty average head size and I know that because I've had many headphones in the past and never had this problem. It constantly slides off and I have to readjust it all the time. If I bend over to pick up the remote I have to hold it in place or it will fall for sure. I cannot turn my head sideways comfortably because it will slide off as well. Also, when the TV goes mute for 3 min while I look for a new show, it goes into static mode and it annoys the heck out of my ears. And me! Not cool. No other headphone I ever owned did this so is quite irritating.<br />Delivery was almost on time and I like the fact that it was cheaper than at the store and easy to install.<br />If You have a big head and have trouble finding a headphone that wont give you a headache, THIS is the one for you. My husband head is huge and it fits him quite comfortably.<br /> If your head is small or even average size, avoid getting this headset 'cause you won't like it."
RA8WQA89GY0D1,4,"I've gone through a few of the inexpensive cordless headphones.  These have by far the best range and sound quality of the affordable models.  Without obstruction, I can easily get 100 feet of good sound. I'm no audiophile but I think the sound clarity is great for this price.  However the soft fit is too loose on the head.  They are comfortable while sitting still, but I am quite active with them doing household chores, yard and hobby work.  These headphones will fall off my head very easily while being active and I have to wear a headband over them to keep them on me when I'm moving around.  I'm sure this loose fit (along with the foam ear-pads) is why some have complained about sound leakage.  The charger is handy, but I like to swap batteries with an external charger, rather than wait overnight for a recharge.  Overall quite pleased; I'd have given five stars were it not for the soft fit."
R1L4TU791FINA7,5,"This product was recommended by my mother's ENT due to her hearing loss. For watching TV at home, it works better than her hearing aides. It just makes her life a little easier."
RD50F7F2VTZ3D,5,came with red and black wire which my tv only had red and white. But was able to connect to cable box in only one port and it still worked when you adjust frequency on charger stand. Still great sound and reception.
R1LVUNHMNUR8LJ,5,These headphones provide excellent audio quality -nice crisp highs and solid deep lows with very little interference. They are comfortable to wear during a long movie.
R17AYVPT0S0AHP,1,"It did not work. Only noise could be received. I let it charge for 24 hours. Tried connecting it to my TV audio output, then my cable box audio output, then my receiver audio output. Each time I adjusted the receiver channel with the tune control. Nothing but noise was received."
R1OCF2AZ6U58EQ,5,"Our friend doesn't have a computer, so on our recommendation she wanted these for her television.  We've had ours about 2 years and love this brand.  They make TV watching easier, and if one person likes sports and the other does not, they are fabulous!"
R8JXWD8TBFFLL,5,"I bought these for my elderly mom who can't here the TV well anymore. Couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase! Sound is rich, clear and detailed. Headphones are comfortable and wireless. Am going to buy a pair for my home so I can listen to music on TV channels while doing housework!"
R1Z2DMQK8MCMAG,3,Improved voice clarity very well and music as well from tv but lots of interference from DVD and difficult tuning but very successful when able to tune out interference.  Well worth the cost.
R2J64WGAVOLRSY,4,nice body. very amazing connections. but volume it' a not good. 3 radio chanel good tv pc and setup every one connect a one signal cable. nice job thanks.
R3K9MGO6ZVZB5D,4,"Being technloid-challenged, I feared assembling or hooking up these wireless wonders. I had only purchased them following a recommendation from a thirtyish friend. Amazingly, there was nothing to assemble or hook up! What?! And they work perfectly, feel fine on my head for hours, and have given me new life to hear (mostly) the dialogue of actors with whispering English accents. If anything, they almost pick up too much sound. Watching that Jim Carrey movie about a guy trying to erase a girlfriend from his memory, the background music came on louder than the dialogue. Anyway, these are amazing and they cost under $100. Bravo!"
R1EYHJZNHOYT5S,4,"Good sound quality,  good battery life. My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that they fit rather loosely on my head. They have a tendencies to fall off if you are moving around and looking down much."
RXSTHCWHO67ZQ,5,Marriage saver! I can hear the subtlest sound without turning the TV volume up to the point of bothering the wife. The sound quality is astonishing too. Very high fidelity and crystal clear! These would help anyone trying to hear the TV in a noisy (KIDS!) environment.
R1JJ6WCUFS1XJC,1,"I bought these to listen to my husband play his electronic drum set. They are flimsy and you have to set the volume pretty high to hear the music. Problem with that is you turn your head the wrong way and a static can come through that really hurts to hear. They work fine if you just sit in one place but if your walking around the house to do chores, not so good."
R1ROGC9VK66GRH,1,"I got mine from amazon and give it a good try (almost 2 years) well they are BAD, I cant do what others do walk around in them and even after putting very expensive battery they still bad<br /><br />I wish I didnt buy them and I wish ive return them"
R15NKBI72VGZ9L,5,Bought these for my husband as he would turn the tv on full blast! Now he turns it all the down and everyone is happy.  They are very comfortable and he can even hear tv if he goes to the kitchen! Would recommend these for anyone who has trouble hearing.
R12ED8KMBJKUFG,1,"These lay right on top of your ears, which would be terrible, but the worst part is that they sit very lightly on your head so that they fall off with any sort of movement. So it's the worst of both worlds. I never even got to the part of plugging them in and listening to them before I boxed them back up for a return."
R2SIQZDZ6M4Z7D,4,"Much more comfortable and less clumsy than old Sennheiser digital headset which died after 2 1/2 years of use. Considering this is not listed as a digital headset, the sound is remarkably good with less background noise than old digital. Tuning dial on headset alternates between pre-set frequencies - be careful, if you accidentally move it with handling, there will be no sound until you adjust it. I have used it for a month and am very satisfied with performance. One of the ear pieces falls off every now and then but it is easily replaced and this is why I have down-rated it to a 4. Over all this headset is a remarkable improvement over old &#34;clunker&#34; Sennheiser digital unit."
R2XURFYM4UEOHU,3,"I'm writing this review for future PC users to be aware that this headset may not work with their PC.<br />I was told by Sennheiser that this headset was made for TV/Stereo setups, and was not specifically developed for PCs.<br /><br />I'm a pretty tech-savy person, and for the life of me, I could not get this headset to work with my PC.<br />Called Sennheiser's customer service and they tried to walk me through it. But even with their instructions, I could not get it to work.<br />The only sound I've ever gotten out of this headset was static, so I cannot review the sound quality."
R1GPRWOUF87KHM,4,I wander around the house and yard and listen to my tv shows. TCM is the best as the old movies have stories not sound and special effects.
R3E5OD8P810E0W,2,Got the 130 version several years ago and LOVED them. For some reason they died after 4-5 years. These 120s are terrible. EVERY time I wear them they fall off because earpieces are too small with no overear cavity. Static still a big problem also.
RUHCXZ9P8JSJJ,4,"I have hearing problems and wear hearing aids.  My audiologist recommended this product.  It performs exactly as advertised.  Set up and use are  simple and easy.  I would give it five stars, but I do not find the ear pieces as comfortable as they could be.  The sound quality is good and the controls are simple and easy.  The distance over which the signal is received is remarkable.  I can walk into the next room  and still hear the TV.  It is a good value for the price."
R1O8FOTW9VD7KT,4,"The 130 had auto tune and ear cushions that held onto your ear.  With this 120 unit, If you bend your head they will fall off.  As for sound, its as good as the 130.  It works very well around the house.  If you have a problem....don't forget to change the channel on the bottom of the base unit.  I have 4 weather transmitters that give this unit a problem.  The problem is solved by changing the channel.  You have a choice of 3.  I have zero interference problems with clear audio.  Sweet.  I just like the 130 better but its not made anymore????<br />I have a total of three Sennheiser wireless units.  They all work at the same time with no problem....."
RRZQFQNB3MKGX,4,Works well but I wouldn't walk around with it on.<br /><br />I bought this because my wife often goes to sleep before I do and I like to watch TV to wind down at the end of the day.<br /><br />There's a frequency selector that pairs from the base to the headphones and a fine tuning dial to get it just right.  Every once in a while I have to adjust the fine tune dial again and I'm not sure if I'm moving it by accident or the unit just needs to be adjusted again.<br /><br />It works great for what I use it for and I'm very happy with it.  I specifically chose this model because I did not want an IR based wireless headphone which requires line of sight and I did not want a 2.4GHz wireless headphone because I already have a cordless phone and a baby monitor in that spectrum which is wreaking havoc on my routers WiFi.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to actively walk around while listening be prepared to hear occasional crackling and popping (only when moving between obstacles and walls).
RK77HSZ8ZYJTU,2,"These headphones were great at first -- I could finally watch TV without distracting my husband who was trying to get work done, or vice-versa. But over time, I started to notice a subtle staticy noise that gradually got worse and worse. It got to the point where I was always trying to adjust the tuner to find the exact correct frequency instead of enjoying whatever I was watching.<br /><br />Eventually, we just got a headphone extension cord that we placed along the wall to the couch and plug in each time we want to use the headphones. The sound is crystal clear, and the wire is worth preventing that annoying static noise."
R3P9ZLC3U6LM6G,5,"It may take a few moments to tune in, but once it is the clarity is great. I use these late at night when I do not want to awaken anyone in the house who has already gone to sleep."
RJ7J9YD2SMNJ1,5,Be sure to plug them into the cable tv box rather than your TV unless you have a great TV speaker. Put the transmitter some distance from electronics. Long cord so not a problem for me.
R3ETYSMK0GWUHT,3,"Don't expect a comfortable cushion on your ears. These are not the &#34;over the ear&#34; type and the minimal cushioning leaves a lot to be desired. That said, my husband finds them acceptable to listen to his sports channels on television which is wonderful because I don't want to hear them. We think they are worth the approximate $80 paid."
R165IITJD91Y1D,5,"This headset is a great improvement over the Radio Shack ones that finally quit. They are comfortable to wear and easy to set up. Just plug in the wires. If I should have trouble, I will update this review."
R1GZXEZNWTJ6PR,2,"Hookup is easy.<br />Versatile to work with many different sources.<br />Range is solid, you can wear them several rooms away from the source without losing the signal.<br />Sound quality is good.<br /><br />One big negative is that on this particular pair it's almost impossible to get the headphones to sit on the recharging cradle securely enough to charge. They're too light and were warped out of the package and no matter how the headphones are turned and twisted they absolutely 100% wlll NOT make a solid enough contact on their own. The only way to get them to charge is to place a weight on top to press them down onto the cradle. That's a big problem. It doesn't sound like it happens to everyone, but it's happening on this pair. I'll give them two stars and issue all would-be buyers a warning. Test the charging connection and make sure it works properly, otherwise send them back immediately."
RVQ0GI4F4F7XM,4,I purchased these headphones to listen to music. I purchased two pairs of wireless headphones in the past from Radio Shack. One was Sony and the other Auvio. They both worked ok but I just wasn't satisfied enough with them so I returned both pair. I don't expect wireless headphones to be as good as wired. I expect to get some interference sometimes. I am able to walk all over my house and outside with only getting a very slight interference for a split second in some spots. I think these are the best wireless headphones I have tried. I have them connected to my pioneer receiver headphone output which probably gets better sound than just connecting them to a pc output. The sound and bass is better than expected. I have the freedom to listen to my huge library of my own music with a mix from Spotify.
R2VVIBJ3E4UBSB,5,My father has been watching tv with closed captioning for several years. He can now enjoy hearing it without blasting everyone out of the room. He just loves them. He said they have good sound and can be turned up very loud. I love being able to give him back this simple pleasure that many of us take for granite.
R2QX3YBWGM8UBL,5,Ive bought others in the past and I can say for sure these are the best I've ever purchased. I recommend!!!
RGLPI8QP6G8QP,5,"This is such a fantastic product for TV watching that my perfect-hearing wife is now using, as well as two sets of friends."
R1QK63V3I28MO5,5,"I bought these for my son for Christmas one year when he was a teenager. He used them for gaming for a couple of years and then told me they had stopped working. I thought I might be able to fix them, so I tucked them in the attic, but I didn't get around to trying to fix them for a couple more years.<br />When I did, I found that the problem was that there was a film of oxidation on the little metal contact strips. I polished that off and they started charging and working. I have used them for the last 5 years.<br />They are way more comfortable than the wired logitech headsets I have used. I can't use them for team games, due to the lack of a mic, but for music or watching netflix, they can't be beat!"
R39CGZYW4SSAI1,5,"I was astonished and delighted with these headphones' splendid performance.  I wanted to listen to all my favorites, to hear what the Sennheisers did with them.  The phones offer plenty of range, covering every room in my apartment, even through two or three walls.  Excellent value for the money."
R1FVZ2NARX9Y3M,5,"My mother has been using headsets to watch TV for the past seven years, we have tried several different brands and these are by far the best sound for the money.  I would recommend these to anyone."
R1RHNA3FINZBZ4,4,"The Sennheiser RS120 meets my expectations, which weren't all that high. I am a professional musician, but did not buy these for a professional application. I exercise in the early mornings, on some pretty loud exercise equipment, and was looking for something wireless that would let me listen to the radio or Netflix on my computer without waking up my wife, or otherwise blasting my neighbors. The sound is good, not great; the reception is good, not great; the price was right, in my experience with wireless headphones. There's a reason that most speaker/headphone applications are wired where quality is a significant consideration, and why good wireless microphones cost a premium price. The cost-benefits analysis for this produce and my needs was a winner."
R12JCAXBHHCQEZ,5,this was a present to my husband. He is very pleased with these earphones and uses them all the time to watch<br />T.V.
RCT3P8LPONQJT,5,We just tried them and everything is working fine with good sound and a nice design on the charging system
R2DTGRUIDTKAWM,2,How can i sum this purchase up with as little wording as possible?  I need a time machine.  That way i can smack myself at moments prior to hitting the purchase button.<br /><br />pro:<br />1:  sound is ok.<br />2:  looks nice<br /><br />con:<br />1:  product is designed either for a small or misshaped head. very uncomfortable to wear.<br />2:  painful on ears with foam pad for more than a few minutes.<br />3:  shape of head phones (extended) does not fit without a little effort on stand.<br />4:  very small length on audio cables.<br />5:  tuner dial is like a radio tuner dial.  hard to get just right.. static... left ear.. right ear... both<br />  mono tone.. and with a slight adjustment stereo.<br />6:  pressure in ears started to hurt after 15 minutes of use.<br /><br />conclusion:<br />my butt is sore from kicking myself on this one.  but i went off of amazon reviews again and got burned.  If you do get it.  unlike me dont destroy the box before using it for a few days.  and keep the receipt.
RE64JL82FYVUL,5,Great product!! I think it saved my hearing.My wife<br />is hard of hearing and now she can hear with head<br />set. T.V. now at normal volume.
ROJE896ZEYCTB,5,Very nice sound for watching TV late at night. great quality. no static. I can hear what is being said.
R1V2TI84SYAH1D,5,She is beyond thrilled with the product!  She keeps thanking me and  telling me she can finally hear every word when she's watching TV!!
R3FSS9OMW0XEEH,5,"Works great even in remote parts of the house. Performance beyond my expectations, and my wife is no longer annoyed by the oplume on the TV!"
RBN8TH9VKG2IK,3,"Feedback is an issue.  Sound may come through clearly at times, but invariably I would pick up short bits of static.  I dealt with it for a while, but it just become a constant annoyance.  I'm going back to wired headphones."
RGO3QEVBBBQ74,5,Great headset. Clear sound.
R1UEC6S2A90VTO,4,The headphones fit my normal sized woman's head poorly.  I had to rig rubberbands to keep them from falling off.
RCB4JXA7AH0DA,5,"This is a very comfortable unit, works great. I can walk outside and still listen to my show.  I can walk on the treadmill and hear everything very clearly."
R5FJ3O8YK95F1,5,"This is my 2nd one like this.  The 1st one lasted a lot of years.  This is the same, but with advanced things.  The sound is much clearer, and it doesn't seem as heavy.  I really works well."
RE4UT1TZ20DPJ,4,"I took a chance and bought 2 pairs of these. I had a pair of Sony for a few years, but they finally refused to work properly so I tried the Sennheisers. They work well. The sound is full and clear. The tuning wheel eliminates all unwanted noise. I would have preferred over-the-ear headsets while these are on-the-ear. The range is excellent, even through walls. I'm pleased with them."
R18KOQS955NCDD,5,"I rent a room in a family home. So when the landlord family goes to bed these Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones allow me to carry on with my computer duties and music enjoyment as loud as I want without bothering anyone. They are comfortable and produce excellent sound. I'm still learning how to get used to eliminating dead air since the headphones seem to turn themselves off after a period of inactivity. Off wouldn't be too bad. It's the static during that off period that's annoying. I'm guessing it's an effort to save battery life. A little annoying, but workable."
R1SS5G7EE8J85B,1,Really bad signal to noise ratio. Too much background noise and tuning does not help much. Will be returning it.
RHEM3U3Z75OBW,5,My husband loves them and I do too-he can listen at the volume he wants without it being too loud for me.
R6ABUR8ASUL4J,5,Great for watching TV. These aren't Grados so don't expect audiophile sound. Light weight and comfortable for a couple of hours.
RBU9NKI8M1C7I,1,"I record music and I like to use headphones that don't jerk off my head every time I reach for the mouse. It would be nice if that unpleasant disruption was not replaced by the burst of noise that happens after 5 minutes of silence. I wonder if the transmitter can be modded to set this useless power saving mode to happen not after five minutes, but something closer to the age of the universe. Did anyone test this product before it shipped?"
R1QYYDT6ISHVDA,5,"Easy hook up for TV sound.  Good quality audio and very comfortable on the head . . . the tension on the headband could be a little tighter, as they tend to slip off when moving around.  Great range . . . never miss a minute of your program while taking out the garbage!  Charging and storage unit is great and stores well behind the TV.  I have had several versions of TV headphones and this unit tops them all by a mile."
RSAEZ2COSSDFU,5,"Saving my marriage!  I like to read, my husband likes to watch movies.  Now we can be together again.  Wonderful sound.  During baseball games he can hear the ball hitting the glove.  These headphones are great."
RNJMK3QBA5YAI,4,"Needed this so I could watch tv in the bedroom while my wife sleeps.  Only took a few minutes to set up.  Headphones are comfortable, and have a decent range and quality."
R1YI8B0AFSG800,3,"These headphones work fine and I can move around the house without losing sound.  It does, however, have a constant static buzzing in the background when moving about.  I was able to find a combination of a channel and sound level on the headphones that would eliminate the static buzz but I would have to be sitting in one place, otherwise, it would come back.  I have only moved around the house to get a blanket or water, not do other stuff, so I am able to, for the most part, enjoy using them."
R1P5JEFXBSD6UD,3,The real range is about 100 feet when there are no walls in the way. The sound quality is good but the headphones are a little heavy which can be uncomfortable after a few hours.
R2I2TG3GVJS34R,5,"This is the third brand of headphones I have purchased in rapid succession. I was on a mission. I am in an apartment for the first time in over 20 years. It is not a great experience. The people upstairs live their lives out loud. Boots, 50 lb. dog, and a new baby. I needed relief. I needed to be able to enjoy my media and music, I just plain needed to block the madness out! This Sennheiser set is the best for my price range.<br />First of all there is not a big variety of this product. The specifics that I was looking for was quality of sound, able to walk around and not have interruption in reception. I a single woman, reasonably intelligent, electronics is not my forte.<br />However, if I have decent instructions, I have found I can do just about everything. Some days you get tired of doing just about everything.<br />Sony is easy to plug in and work. Vizio TV (had to purchase in KS) sets up a complication with only an audio/optical plug in. They were easy to use, great reception, quality, Heavy as can be and may neck was killing me in 5 days. Next TV Ears. Suggestion of a friend. The ear buds are hard and my ears were killing me in less than 48 hours.I did not use them more than 6 hours in that time span. They are not soft, they are hard. I needed a work around if I wanted to not hear my tv in the background of everything. I have TV, Roku, Blu Ray DVD, and computer all going through my tv with cable. Frustrated, even bought an audio out box, but was too tired to tackle it. Woke up and said isn't there a headphone that qualifies here that I can just plug in? With another day of research - I found Sennheiser. They include a plug that makes the set compatible with RCA optical/audio out. Their work around is an easy to use double ended plug. Yeah! The volume is touchy, the quality is good, not as good as Sony. They are lighter. More money might make a difference here. Weight, controls, the easy out of the box installation less than 5 minutes, and of course quality of sound are deal breakers."
R224EI2KXKRX7Z,5,Great headphones with very good sound and a comfortable wear. In addition if you ever need to change the rechargeable battery you can do it yourself. Sony comparable headphones must be returned to Sony to have the battery changed.<br /><br />I would recommend these headphones.
R2DCSXQX50XVJ5,2,"very uncomfortable . hard to adjust sound for each ear, pops, a lot of static. the only good thing is that it has a lot range. will never buy this brand again."
R1H9CVN9KO1QJ2,4,Works OK sound quality is good  when using the Stereo  tuner or TV/SAT. A little confusing when using the volume and the attenuation for for fine tuning.
R230A44RBF3L84,5,Bought these for my husband for a Christmas gift.  I was worried that I wouldn't pick out something acceptable for my techie husband.  He has commented more than once that the sound quality of these headphones is phenomenal!
R2ETZCI48UUEG7,4,excelent device. I like it. strong and relayable. good for house with kids. you can listen to TV and radio while moving around the house
R11F8IFIMFFDB5,2,"Even with buying a replacement pair, which also failed m/.I have had three of this make earphone, and last two versions failed md."
R3KXQJKM1YJR97,3,"These were my first pair of wireless headphones so I cannot compare quality, etc. to others. I use them 4-5 times per week for about 8 months. The volume control and ability to tune in/out right on the heahphones is great. I have not had to replace the rechargeable batteries yet. They are comfortable and adjustable. Alao, the cables from the base unit to connect your device are surprisingly long which is a great feature  My only complaint is the audio quality is not crystal clear. Again, this is the first pair I have owned, so maybe no headphones in this price range will deliver crystal clear audio.<br />I have noticed the quality of the RCA cables makes a difference. The cables from the TV and DVD are medium quality while the cables from my iPad are lower quality and the headphone sound suffers. Overall, I am happy with the purchase, but may spend more next time to see if audio improves."
R14EZ2KHHQKMP,5,"The quality is outstanding.  The distance from TV works well when I let dog out, go to kitchen, etc.<br />The charging unit is a 10 star feature that allows one to never forget the charging!<br /><br />Why would anyone not want to purchase this quality laden headphone?"
R31B230Q287W10,5,"My husband has hearing problems and deafens me with the tv volume.  I bought these for him and now I hear nothing.  So simple to operate,  highly recommend these"
RHYRW60CQIO0E,5,"I am hard of hearing and have tried numerous other wireless headsets. under $100.  All have been satisfactory to me for one reason or another.  I was looking for comfort, light weight, sound quality and ease of use, the Sennheiser RS120 has won me over by being 100% of what I was looking for, I love it.  Sennheiser has won me over as a customer for life and I will gladly pass their name along to anyone I know looking for a similar device."
RRHKACQXXABZL,5,"Clear sound. Easy to connect. This is my second set - I wanted for a separate room.would definitely recommend, as my first one was to me.<br />The seller shipped promptly and as scheduled"
R2I4W056I48VV4,5,These are the best headphones I have ever had for watching TV.  My older mother finds them comfortable and easy to use.
R7FRB3BMGRVF2,4,Good reception all over the house.  The charger works without having to do anything but put the headset on it.
R1UMTYUDOZISS0,5,"I really like this headset, it is soft on my ears and adjustable for the family.  Only issue is that the frequency interfers with my home alarm system so I had to put it as far away from the wireless alarm system as possible.  That does help."
RHBTO1QCYNDR0,5,This product is great and does what it is meant to do. It even came with batteries which I did not realize it would. Worth the money because you know it'll be what you wanted.
R35R7NCOHID5UL,5,"For the price this system works well.  Very easy to install but make sure that your tv or cable/satellite box has an audio out.<br /><br />A couple notes if you buy this.  First when you plug it in it says that the green light is supposed to come on.  My set didn't and I kept retrying to insert the power plug.  I finally thought that the light might be faulty so I went ahead and set it up.  As soon as I plugged in the RCA jack for audio the green light came on.  Another problem I had was that I couldn't get anything but static through the headphones.  I mean really bad static that varied when I moved my head.  Once again tried relocating the base unit to no avail.  There are three switches/thumbwheels on the headset.  One of them is marked Tuning.  I thought that meant bass/treble.  Nope, just like an old FM portable radio you have to rotate the tuning wheel until you get a clear signal.  I wear glasses and I notice a little discomfort wearing headphones.  The earpads are fairly soft but I think the design could be a little better.  For me, ear buds would definitely be better.<br />So if you consider this remember you need an audio out and when everything is plugged up on the transmitter just tune the headset to a good signal and you will be good to go.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have had these headphones a few days now and they seem to be just getting better and better.  The sound is amazing, no hiss that I have heard others describe. I got an optical audio cable that has rca plugs and am using that instead of the regular rca output. Makes a big difference. I suppose there may be something out there that sounds better than these but I doubt I could tell the difference.  I don't think anyone would regret buying these headphones.  I changed my rating to 5 stars!"
R1S3CVGVU0BT9Q,5,"I purchased these headphones for me elderly roommate who is nearly deaf and neither of us could be happier with them.  In the past I have purchased cheapo versions of wireless headphone set ups to allow her to watch television at a sound level she can hear while letting the rest of us remain among the hearing as she needs to have the volume up very high. I finally decided that I was tired of her constant complaints about the various ones I had purchased breaking etc, and I bit the bullet and bought these after thoroughly researching all of the alternatives.  These were not cheap although I did get them at an excellent price but their superior quality is obvious and the sound they produce is truly remarkable in its clarity.  Leave it to the Germans to do things right and in this instance they did just that.  I have no complaints and neither amazingly enough, does she.  I highly recommend these if you have had trouble with cheapo versions in the past because they will solve your problems instantly ."
R9V13HR2EEQTW,5,I have bought these for family members and give as gifts. I got such positive feedback I bought some for myself .
RU53O2TRSX6W2,5,These headphone were just what my wife and I needed for a good nights sleep and still be able for the other to watch TV.
RA2QAV469I9EP,5,Love the quality and ease of use. Only thing that could be better is some kind of attachment to keep headphones on when you lead foward.
R30EHTFRPDUZ5K,4,"I am still trying to configure this to my TV so that I can listen at a higher volume due to a hearing deficiency while my wife listens to the TV at her normal volume.  As to being a wireless speaker system, it is that and works well.."
R1WOE2H0VEJ0DJ,5,I couldn't be happier with this product. I can finally understand dialogue in movies. I can hear sounds I never imagine existed. There is no sound distortion and the headphones are comfortable.
R2QO9MXODP2QW1,4,"The good:<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent, especially when close to the transmitter.  Plenty of bass response.<br /><br />Charging them up is super easy, just toss them on the the cradle.  Sometimes I need to move them around a bit until they start charging but usually it's not too much fuss.  I've never once run down the batteries even after hours and hours of use.  And this is with the El Cheapo NiMH batteries they give you.  Put some Sanyo Eneloops in there and I'm sure you could use them all day long on a single charge.<br /><br />The range is truly impressive as far as wireless headphones go.  I have 6 acres to mow and I can pick up a signal a surprisingly good distance away from the house.  Getting a bit more height on the transmitter would help.  It would be better if they had a jack for an external antenna rather than having to toss the entire transmitter up in the attic.  I like that these are analog;  I'd rather deal with a lot of static than have them completely cut out with low signal like digital ones would.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />I am now on my second set.  The tuner on my first set went bad after I wore them outside in a _very_ light sprinkling rain.  After that I could tune them in but every few seconds I'd get static as if the frequency was drifting.  Buying a replacement set of headphones (receiver only) wasn't much cheaper than the entire kit.  You can call me an idiot for not using them in a perfectly dry environment (and you're probably right), but I still think they should have held up a bit better than that.<br /><br />The automatic gain control on these is terribly annoying.  During quiet passages the headphones will boost the gain and you hear HISSSSSS.  Likewise, loud volume input gets automatically quieted.<br /><br />They are comfortable at first but after several hours the on-ear design causes my ears to get a bit sore.  I definitely would not want to wear these for 8 hours straight.  The head band is comfortable enoughthough.<br /><br />If you're doing some yard work which requires bending down, like digging a grave or picking up cow droppings, the headphones have a tendency to slip right off your head.  Without even realizing it, over time I learned to walk around perfectly erect like Joe Friday.  Needless to say, this slows down the work.  I wouldn't even think about using them for exercise.  You could try wearing a baseball cap _over_ the headphones if you want to attempt it.<br /><br />I looked everywhere for a set of compatible speakers to go with this transmitter.  I didn't want to have to deal with 2 different devices hooked up to my audio source at all times or switching back and forth.  Having a set of speakers in the bathroom would be handy for catching the morning news.  Unfortunately, I never did find any.  I did not try calling Sennheiser as it wasn't _that_ important.  (If anyone knows of an inexpensive compatible set please leave a comment here.)<br /><br />I have since stopped using these headphones altogether.  Here's a better setup:<br /><br />For about the same cost, you can get a [[ASIN:B003FO4UHW 0.5 W Fail-Safe Long Range FM Transmitter]] which will go _much_ farther.  Use an inexpensive set of FM headphones for the receiver.  And for mowing/trimming, use a 5 dollar pocket radio and earbuds underneath shooting earmuffs.  That makes way more sense hearing-wise than cranking the Sennheiser headphones up loud enough to overcome mower noise.  Best of all, that setup works with the radio you might already have in your kitchen/bathroom/etc."
R28J0XLETVDSP2,3,I am having a lot of trouble connecting it to my LG 52&#34; TV and making it work.  It will not work if I use Netflix.  Really disappointing.
RANEHQO5QFPCQ,3,"Not great quality, Range is about 100 ft from what I have been able to test but has difficulty getting through walls.  Good to watch TV at night with your roommate or significant other sleeping"
R21KZQTJ3WKBTH,4,Excellent sound reproduction. Over the ear phones are not quite as we'll padded as earlier models have been. Very satisfied.
R2J809QVFYFLB8,5,"This is what my kids wanted for Christmas. They are very happy with them (we bought 2 sets). They live in a house where the kids can hear the TV playing at night and it kept them awake- now that they have the headphones to listen to TV at night, the house is quiet. They work very well."
R2ZYK9QVJQQCZ0,4,Once in awhile my husband looses the sound and sharpness of his computer because it is a radio frequency.  He loves the fact that there is no chord draped over the keyboard or mouse pad to interfere with work.  They have been in constant use since Father's Day!
RQ46YFC1WGNQH,5,"Our house is very small and anyone wanting to watch TV after the rest of the household went to bed created issues. After much research I decided to buy the Sennheiser RS120 and crossed my fingers that it would work as well as many folks claimed. It worked better than expected. I sometimes even use the headphones when I am alone because the sound balance is so much better than my own TV. My only difficulty was determining which jack to plug it into. Not being an electronic engineer and because every TV is configured just different enough from the instructions, I just went eeny-meeny (you get the idea) and found the correct audio out jack after only 5 tries.<br />If you have TIVO or something similar you need to turn the headphones off when you pause it or after a few seconds you will get a horrible electronic hissing noise in your ears. I'm quite used to doing this now and I don't even think about it.<br />If you put the headset back on the charging stand each time you are done with them you won't have any problems.  I have had them almost four months now and am thinking of getting a second set so my husband and I can enjoy good sound quality together while watching our favorite movies."
R1P41N0EEZEJH7,4,Finally a headphone that actually works for me! I am enjoying my tv programs once again. I am telling all my friends.
R1CC0042RZI9NB,5,"These were replacements for ones I damaged and lost several of the pieces... I was working in the battery compartment of this 787 Dreamliner a few months back when..... oops, never mind..."
R34JRJ55P4G5RT,5,I just bought my second pair and have had my first pair for over 4 years and they still work fine.
R148CYDFL7Q5YS,5,"After a trauma, i am now effectively deaf on my right side.  THese headphones allow me to hear almost as well as my normal hearing (I guess the vibrations through the skull- I dunno and I don't care) I can watch TV and movies without having the volume up to 100 and disturbing the entire neighborhood (let alone the family)"
R3G9PLZ5KRE306,5,"My husband thanks you!! He can now sleep while I watch TV.  They are perfect for this purpose.  No noise can be heard outside the headphones, they aren't too loud in my ear, and I can get up and walk around the house and still hear my program. Wish I could lay on my side and watch TV, but cannot. Also, have to store headphone charger at the wall across the room where the TV is because the base has to be plugged into the television, so every morning, I must remember to out the headphones back on their charger.  Had to get a table to put the charger on, as our tv is wall mounted.  But it is what it is."
R91OTVG1N8YSN,5,This product is great.  It allows my husband to watch movies without constantly asking what a character says interrupting my enjoyment of the movie.
R3MZIVAZFW94X9,4,"I use these to watch TV when my wife falls asleep.  I have them connected to audio out on my TiVo Premiere so all I do is mute my A/V receiver and put on the headphones. They work great.<br /><br />Only had one issue with them so far and it has only happened once.  They lost connection after sitting on the base.  Tried tuning them and got nothing, not even static.  Unplugged them from the wall power and plugged them back in and they have worked fine ever since."
RLTTFFZTG8R3L,3,I had to buy a new headphone set to replace the discontinued Sennheiser RS140. Because the RS140 has left & right ear adjustment it was perfect for my hearing loss. The RS120 does not have that feature so it is not quite as good as the RS140 but a good headphone none the less.
R33A8NXRIVC9BY,5,Use it every night in our bedroom.  Wife reads I watch TV and everyone is happy.  We call it our marriage saver.
R1NOKEG9OBO6G0,5,I have owned several wireless headsets and this set is superior to any so far. Great sound-easy setup-easy tuning-easy recharging. I love them!
R2U1YBBCBYH4JD,5,"I bought these as a gift for my father who has gone through 4-5 sets of the cheap ones that you see everywhere.  This set has been perfect for him.  Good sound, good range and very durable so far.  I'd advise you to spend the money on a quality product the first time and save the hassle."
R1D38HDK99HY83,4,"These headphones have unbelievable sound. You can hear things on TV that are not discernible without them. We just plugged them in as directed and they were ready for use. The only complaint is that the ear pieces are quite large and although they are comfortable, they get kind of warm- like wearing winter ear muffs. Probably when the house is cooler is winter it won't be an issue."
R2519FKCNVV7ZF,5,the only person that loves these earphones more then me is my hubby who can now sleep while I enjoy insomnia:)
R1Q19544Z2C95R,4,"First of all, as to sound quality, I want to make it clear that I purchased these for television watching, not listening to music.  I needed something wireless for tv because I have severe tinnitis and sometimes have to crank the tv way up and still miss a lot of the sounds and dialogue.  I have other Sennheiser headphones and earbuds that I love for music.<br /><br />So, that said, the sound is excellent for my use.  I have not a single complaint in terms of the sound.  They give me more and better sound than I could have ever expected.  I cannot believe how much stuff I was missing on my tv shows!<br /><br />They are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, so be sure you know that when you are shopping.  If you want noise-cancelling headphones you will not want these.<br /><br />The range seems perfectly good.  I have the unit located somewhat centrally in my large-ish house and I can walk all over the house and outside without interference.  They do not interfere with my phones or home network.  You want to make sure that is something you take into account.  My phones are the 6.0 Dect technology and my home network is 2.4ghz, so these are on a completely different frequency.<br /><br />I was glad that they came with an adapter for the 'audio output' port on my Sony 42' living room television because the red and black plugs didn't work with the red/white outputs.  So, you need to make sure you have the correct outputs.  The adapter turns the red/black plugs into a single 3.5mm headphone type plug.<br /><br />They have a large-to-small hole (slip the nail or screw in the larger part and slide the unit down where the hole gets smaller so it won't fall out) on the back of the charger unit for hanging convenience.  I actually had this unsightly bolt coming out of this brick wall piece and it hangs perfectly on that.  I rather like that better than trying to find something to set it on top of and not worry about somebody knocking it off.  Then, the headphones just sit atop the frame for charging. The way the cradle is designed they stay securely atop the charging unit.<br /><br />You get plenty of battery time, per charge.  When I first got these I kept track of time just so I could not have any surprises.  I got to over ten hours and got bored with that, so I haven't tested them out beyond that.  For over ten hours of use, I had plenty of charge.<br /><br />Now, for my one issue - and it's not a total dealbreaker, but just an annoyance - The shape of the over-the-head part is a little bit on the squarish side.  I have, I guess, a normal size female head so 99.9% of all over-the-head headphones fit me perfectly in the smallest position.  These are kind of square-ish over the top.  So, while they fit nicely and feel comfortable, if I bend over they will fly right off my head.  They don't feel really loose or anything, but I think it's just that the shape of the over-the-head band (or whatever you'd call it) is less rounded than others I have.  I have a pair of Sennheiser (wired) HD555 headphones I use for music and they are absolutely perfect in fit.  I wish these were shaped more like that.<br /><br />But, I just got used to it because these are otherwise perfect for me for watching television.  Beyond that they are very comfortable - nice and cushy on the ears and I wear glasses.  The band adjusts out for larger heads, like all other headphones I've ever had.e frame for charging.

R2KKAYQYVJPZQ2,4,"The only reason I didn't love it is because I can't get it to work with my DVD player and that is most likely may fault. If someone can tell me how then I would really love them ,The sound is great."
R7EAVDUX97CPW,5,"got these for my husband to watch it's always sunny in philadelphia and it works like a charm.  great sound, wireless, and comfortable."
R3PF038WOR5Z6U,1,"I can't complain about the build quality at all: they are light and comfortable but still very solidly built, both the phones and charger.  Unfortunately, they fail at their primary purpose, which is audio.  When the transmission is clean, the audio quality is great, but it rarely ever is clean.  Then, not only do they pop, crackle, and oh yes, hiss, but occasionally when signal cuts out entirely due to interference, you're treated to an eardrum-shattering blast of static at full volume.  I understand that some peoples homes have worse interference than others, but then I expect them to go silent, not blast my ears with full-volume noise.<br /><br />I own three sets of Sennheiser wired headphones and they're simply awesome, so I hate giving such a poor review to one of their products, but I simply can't recommend these to anyone that wants to keep their sanity or hearing."
R3UOLNYG4K3GXS,5,They surpass my expectations. They sound great and are very comfy to wear. I don't know their broadcast range but it's greater then the length of the house. I especially like the accessibility of the controls.The TV which has a high-end audio built in never sounded better. I give the Sennheiser RS120 a 10 out of 10.
R33YN7MNNA4DMD,5,"As soon as I hooked this up, I about fell over from the superior quality of the sound. And it's super easy to set up. I bought these for my husband who is very hard of hearing. He can hear well with these. No more screaming tv and I'm a happy camper, too!"
R3G5G8Q3SONS3,3,The good<br /><br />Battery life<br />Nice looking charge stand/base<br />Decent sound level<br />Fairly comfortable headphones<br />Comes with adapters to attach to just about anything<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />Not digital<br />Manual tuning required<br />Manual channel selection on base<br />Prone to interference<br />Picks up phone calls sometimes<br />Confusing instruction manual
R2NOGI1RH0DZ1G,2,"They are pretty convenient,  the sound quality is meh.  I get some static popping sometimes.  I think they are worth about $20 less than I bought them for.  Definitely not as nice as my other pair of sennheisers,  but I guess that is the price of wireless freedom.<br /><br />Sorry but I had to come back and give this one less star.  I don't know who in that company decided they would time out the headphones after a few minutes of no sound,  I mean,  I guess I can see the logic.  The problem is when this happens my ears are met with LOUD white static.  It is so, SO annoying.  I can't recommend these to anyone."
RZIGXYCGG8XFT,5,I am at the age where my hearing is bad to worse? I could not get the TV loud enough for me to understand! with these headphones I can pretty well hear everything on the air? I had a cheaper set that did not work unless you were directly in front of the transmitter. with these new ones I can walk completely away from the room and still hear the TV. The only complaint I have is I wished they locked over your ears so they wold stay on your head better. you have to be careful if you bend over they will fall off your head. The sound is great and works great so far. I am very proud of them so far!!!!!
R319EPZX4R5K84,5,"Couldn't be happier with this product.  I hadn't purchased headphones in years (only earbuds), and have never owned wireless ones.  Most of the reviews reference listening to television; I was purchasing headphones to listen to music, classical at that.  So I really had no idea what I was buying in terms of sound quality, wireless functionality, etc., but I did rely on the mostly positive reviews.  I'm amazed at the sound quality (no comparison with earbuds), and the wireless capability and range has been equally surprising.  Worth every penny."
RQ51TDJKKWTI6,2,The headphones were not working at all.It could have been a bad pair but I couldn't get them to work at all.
R2V8RXVUJK8VNW,4,I am able to hear my program over the rattle of my stationary cycle.  I like the sound quality and they are light and comfortable.  It is wireless so there are no cords hassles.
R38B6TU0SKUT43,4,"So far so good.<br /><br />Just not sure if charging for long will ruin it's battery. I recently changed system to bose , will have to figure out if it will work as good as it did with Harman Kardan system I had before"
R3RF6BT7CA96G4,5,"I bought this for my Dad who is very hard of hearing.  He has a tendency to keep the TV volume up very high driving my mother crazy.  The results are fantastic.  He loves the headphones, he can now hear the TV clearly at all times and my mother can listen at her volume.  Happiness has been restored."
R1ROXGRXKCGQ7Z,4,"The headphones work great for my purpose.  They allow me to listen to TV, etc. at night without bothering my handicapped wife. I just plug them into my receiver and can listen to TV, DVDs, CDs, Sirius, etc. The range is excellent. The only negative is that they are a little bulky."
RLWQ1Q5S5XU0U,4,"I like it a lot.  The only two things I would grange a little are; the ear phones don't fit flush to the ear, a swivel of some sort to help them fit square to any head would help. Also, the spring is a little light on the head.  It is fine if you are sitting still but if you move about or bend down, they may fall off.  Perhaps adjustable pressure and a swivel mount would make a good product better."
RE00QNDPSZLCC,5,"This is already solving my problem of needing to boost the volume, but it is also convenient for viewing/hearing late at night without bothering anyone else within earshot. I just mute the tv volume and use my new headset. They are not cheaply made, and the quality and convenience are  well worth the cost"
RZQO9PD1V4J2Z,5,My husband and I each use these so we can watch different programs/TVs.  Great for our motorhome.  I can make dinner and watch my recordings .. even walk a long way outside and still get coverage.
R2SKEGVOYCIQA5,3,"The sound quality was okay for wireless headphones. But you have to tune them, to your satisfaction which was little inconvenient. Biggest surprise was, it giving out static when kept idle for some time. I dont know if thats a common behavior or mine was faulty. That was a disappointment and I had to return it."
R2PA6LT8XZ268D,2,"The quality of the headphones are fine for TV viewing and the charging stand does it's job, however since the headphones make it slightly top-heavy, you need a solid foundation to place it on. I agree with a previous reviewer (and I wish I had taken the review seriously), they just will not stay on your head! If you get up out of a chair and bend your head to do so, they will slip off. If you bend over to get something like from the refrigerator, they slip off. This is so troublesome that it infuriates me. Surely the manufacturer has to be aware of what I think is a fatal flaw."
R3AKP2HKDISD4L,4,Setup was quick and easy.  Sound is excellent.<br />One think I learned is if you mute the TV you need to turn the headphones off.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to listen to TV without bother anyone else.
R14S1J82QC5EQL,5,"Item was exactly described by the manufacturer/Amazon. The quality of the item is excellent, & extremely sturdy. If I were manufacturing the next product in this line, then I would also make the headphones more adjustable over the head of the wearer; also I would color code the on/off switch, volume switch, & tuner switch---as well as making these switches a tad larger for an easier grip---especially when the headphones are already on your head & you cannot see the switches.<br />I purchased this item primarily to use when watching a TV program.<br />This item is a great buy."
R16IFKZUI7HPV8,5,"I use these headphones for watching TV when I need to keep from disturbing others. They are very comfortable on the ears and appear sturdy. I do need to turn the volume up on my TV to hear through these although no sound comes from the TV speakers since I am plugged in to the TV. This is how my previous Sony headphones also worked for me. After a couple of years, my Sony went out in one ear and the padding on the earphones deteriorated making it hard to wear against the ears. The sound quality is very clear and I am happy with my purchase."
R1WDYUF18H1RM2,5,sound comes in outside of house and beyond. clear sound and voice controls are easy to use. placement on charging stand is simple picks up charge with first set down
R5LGBTG5RNWKD,5,"I tried many other brands at this price point but the RS120 beats them all - hands-down! I use them primarily for tv shows and movies and these are the best for sound quality, clean transmission and comfort. One of the big factors in my decision was do they adequately amplify a line-out signal and the RS120 delivers where all of the other headphones I tried were markedly weaker in this aspect.  I highly recommend this product"
R2PXRQNLC8ON8B,4,"I really like these headphones; the clarity of sound is amazing.  The only things that could be improved upon have to do with minor issues:  1. They are very comfortable but tend to slip around some when I tilt my head (I do stretching exercises while wearing them or this would not be a problem at all); 2. The tuning control is located directly under the volume control and I often hit it accidentally, and then must do a bit of re-tuning. The headphones need to be tuned the first time but do not require re-tuning each time they are turned on unless the control has been moved; I'm considering putting masking tape over the tuning control to prevent accidental movement.  These are minor issues, however, and I would recommend them highly and will definitely purchase the same ones again when the need arises.  For sound and comfort I would rate them a high five."
RZTBYTXYX5AE5,5,"I just wish my amp would let me use it without cutting out all the sound for the rest of my family.  I am hard of hearing and this thing is wonderful.  Especially, when kids are playing, pots and pans are rattling, etc.  The range is just fantastic....I go anywhere inside the house and even outside."
R1TD1Z2QGYVTZE,2,"I bought these, and was pretty happy with the sound (but not ecstatically). However, the design and quality are both pretty poor. First of all, right after I put them on, my wife said, &#34;What, are you landing a jet on an aircraft carrier?&#34; I figured they'd be big, but woah, these things are MASSIVE. And not just in appearances. I've got a standard-sized coconut, and I found that these slip right off if I leaned forward or back, even on the tightest setting. Then there's the switches: the master power switch, and volume and tuning dials are on the backside of the headphones, which meant that, if I reclined on a pillow, all three would inadvertently be adjusted.<br /><br />Poorly done."
R2BJ84HNM93CEC,2,"I have tried using this product multiple times while walking on my treadmill.  The headphones work for 2-5 minutes and then cut out and go to complete static.  Sometimes when I change the channel on the charger I will get sound back right away and sometimes I won't.  I purchased these for the sole purpose of using on the treadmill while my husband and children are asleep in the morning, so they have been of no use to me since they don't work in that environment."
R1WKF6MURQS52Y,5,"My wife has trouble hearing and her hearing aids were not much help with speech and tv sound, a friend purchased these headphones and like them so we thought we'd try them....excellent choice.  She is very satisfied with them."
R1E2WZPBS8DZQY,4,Needed to be able to hear the TV without bothering my wife. Plenty of volume control and clarity. For once I can understand what is being said. Better than wearing my hearing aids!
R3PSACOV8J8GQS,3,"The audio was exceptional and a great solution for watching TV when my wife is sleeping. Also my hearing is going, so the ability to understand every word was a great aid for me. You have to rotate a dial to tune in the frequency, but that's a minor nuisance, once you get used to it. Two problems should be mentioned to prospective buyers, however. First, I find the center head piece (on top of my head) to be uncomfortable too soon - like a half hour. I'm assuming that's because they have slots for the charging stand cut into the foam on top of the headset (so there is connection for charging). The headset, for me is loose, so you can't move around much without fooling with it. Second problem, for me, was that the unit stopped working within 4 months. Kudos to Amazon for being willing to replace them. However, if I could have, I would have exchanged it for an upgraded RF unit that Sennheiser makes and would have gone for the difference. The small earpiece units that hang downward would undoubtedly be more comfortable. We'll see if the replacement has problems. Whatever you do, get the RF wireless unit - not the IR units - so you don't have to worry about line-of-site interruption."
R3EU4NLD7Y8XGA,5,"I purchased this product for my father who is hard of hearing.  He has used two other similar products (e.g. TV Ears, etc.) and this one is his favorite by far.  According to him the sound quality is excellent (much better than the other products he's used) and the range of reception is superior to the others he's used.  They seem to be very well made (durable and sturdy) but he's only used them for about 1 month so we will have to see.  I'll give an updated review in 6 months."
R2R64E6D421MO0,5,Husband likes it a lot as it not only vastly improves the audible but it makes it possible for others to have the TV at a normal volume.
R2AMME0MYPJ9BA,5,"This unit fills the need. I've got a hearing loss and most often can't hear the TV or<br />radio even with the volume all the way up.  This provides me with hearing ease on the TV set also with the script on the bottom. And best of all,when the commericals show up I just flip the switch and enjoy the mute."
R305P8U2NYBDFF,4,"These headphones worked great until this week, a year since I bought them. Note, I did buy the 'cheaper' ones for around $60. There is static for the first second when you turn them on and a slight, slight hiss if its real quiet, but I can typically ignore it, so it was never a problem. They work great through walls, or at least well enough to suit me. I like the fact its goes through walls, and that you can tune it (which really helps!), the main downside is that they never really seemed to fit securely my head."
R3QCUPRSIGY65B,1,"I have tried two of these headphones. I returned one because I could not get the power connection inserted into the base. I tried the second set hoping I had a defective product the first time. Now, after a few months of use, the stand had been jiggled and I cannot get the power connection inserted again! The necessary contact is so small and the space for pushing the components together so limited, that it is a frustrating and clearly temporary setup. They even have a silly illustration of how to push the contacts together, so this must be a known problem. I'm not sure how to accomplish return of a defective product, but will definitely pursue this!"
R3MTUVA9HT88G6,4,"Overall, I like these wireless headphones. It works great but there is 1 hangup for me. Sometimes, the &#34;tune&#34; dial moves (I must trigger it but I can't imagine how) and I lose the sound. What follows is a bit of tinkering with the tune dial until the sound returns and, by then, I've missed some dialog and need to rewind the show. Yes, I recommend this product but stay away from the &#34;tune&#34; dial once it's been setup."
R304XKM9VZYK78,5,"These headphones are great, they have really good bass quality and when tuned correctly have minimal hiss.<br /><br />The only don side is that they have auto leveling, which means during quieter periods of music it will turn the volume up, so that when the music comes back in again full force it self adjusts and turns the volume back down. Haven't found how to turn that off yet ..."
R21O7CPBYAV0O8,3,In order to use earphones have to plug in earphone jack to TV and when you want to go back to listening through the TV speakers have to unplug the TV jack. Also after a few hours the batteries on the earphone run down and have to switch to normal TV speakers
R2EN8UWWPNJ1WJ,5,"We replaced an old pair of Sennheiser headphones that we used for many years with these rechargeable ones. They are super comfortable with great sound delivery. If one person wants to read or sleep while the other one watches TV, they come in handy. I have some hearing loss and difficulty with certain tones and these headphones deliver clear sound without having to turn up the volume. They have a great range so I can still listen to the audio when leaving one room and going to the kitchen or another room in the house without having to pause the show. We would recommend these without a doubt!"
RKKSIC0SPSSLH,5,"I purchased these for my hard-of-hearing father-in-law.  They work well for him, and the TV is not blasting for the rest of us.  He said the sound quality is much better than the blaring TV speaker.  Make sure the headphones are not hanging crooked on the stand or they will not charge."
R2JGFPMXNCRIHM,5,I have already reviewed Sennheiser products. We just needed another cradle and chose the best. One can't get a better product in sound than Sennheiser.
R2EHTSJQE09BLM,2,Very uncomfortable.  I had to return.  I did not realize that they went over the ear.  I must have missed this point when I read the reviews.
RM32WAWBTCQ1F,5,I love this product. I think my five stars reflect how this product has addressed a necessity in my bedroom. I like to watch some TV before I go to sleep and to not disturb my wife is excellent. The product itself feels of a good quality. The sound is very good. It has some leakage as in if you make it a little loud the person sleeping next to you can hear it. But I control it by keeping the volume low. The battery charge lasts almost like a week with 10-30 minutes of watching every day. I put it back on the cradle once in a while otherwise it rests on the nightstand for me.. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless headphone!
R36FMPK7X72SF2,1,Very disappointing. The headphones do not hold the connection - it would spontaneously disconnect even when I made no movement or changed the volume or tuning settings. Sent it back.
R2VVVE55F9E786,4,These enable me to hear the TV without breaking the eardrums of those in the same room with me.  The sound is great.
R2GBZUPDM6B2Z1,2,"Editing my review after using the headset for about a year.  Oddly the volume for some programs is louder than for others.  Not sure why.  Headset will fall off your head if you lean forward or back.  Sometimes loses signal so you get earful of static.  When the headset does work, it doesn't work that well.  Sound quality isn't very good and the varying degrees of volume for different programs would keep me from buying them again."
R1EUGOK2YE2Q0U,5,"It the miracle of hearing come true.  My T:V is about 2 M. away and nothing could be hooked on it because you would have to see it quite close, so this was the perfect solution"
RK97A50G3YFWF,5,"I have been trying to find dissent wireless headphones with good quality and moneywise affordable. I bought RCA WHP141B 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones (30 Bucks). I used them for almost a year because I just had a baby at time and did not want to disrupt his attention with TV noise. So, I accepted to live with hisses and noise. They only worked in one room with tolerable background noises and in the front of the TV. After unsatisfied results, I decided to upgrade and go for the relatively expensive ones which where about 52 bucks. Within a week, I took them back. Too much noise, hiss...just intolerable back noises.<br /><br />After all these bad experience, I decided to go for the money Sennheiser RS 120 after many good reviews about them I wanted to try them. I borrowed them from my friend just to have an experience before I buy them. Geez..!!!Where have you been RS 120? No noise at all, they work in every corner of my house with absolutely no hiss, no nothing! I even challenged them and went outside when I was going to the store. Guess what? I had a perfect signal from my parking lot about 15 meters from the TV. Just for the sake of challenge I went in my car, still perfect signal. I started the car and drove to see where I am going to lose the signal. About 30 meters away I still had perfect signal (keep in my mind, this is around the apartment in the middle of houses) still with great signal. Then from there, noises and hisses but I could still listen to my TV until I completely lost the signal in about 50 meters. Isn't it this crazy? I just tipped off my hat for these headphone sets. I will definitely buy and recommend them for anyone who has been looking around for good quality wireless headphones like me but  in vain."
R32KFQIOACOXUQ,5,"This product has solved our &#34;hearing&#34; problems with tv and movies.  Not only is the sound clear, but it has stereo and bass that just makes everything we hear more vibrant.  I have even gone to the mailbox at the end of our driveway and still had connection.<br />I highly recommend this product!"
R31H13QGOGBN0F,2,"THE BAD: Nearly impossible to get these adjusted to where there is no static present. Also they will cut off without warning, nearly deafening you with a burst of static.<br /><br />THE GOOD: Inexpensive and quite impressive range."
R34YF9P41JRR41,3,"It served its purpose,and that is all its worth.  If I had tested it say in the store, I would of kept looking."
R3BI4WVAG1XPTU,4,Item was as advertised and is reliable. The price could have been better but I am satisfied. Used to use the sony headphones.
R33KD82TI0JZ1B,5,"Good bass response. Nice that the volume control is on the earpiece because our tv sound out doesn't have variable volume. This one was for the wife, I may have to get another set for myself."
RW9Q22PLEBYAQ,4,"sometimes you just cant sleep and your &#34;roommate&#34; is sleeping peaceful. If you do NOT want to experience the Wrath of Kain get a pair of these babies. They work great, are comfortable, but your cant fall asleep wearing them."
R2B1FMU9DCNGX3,2,"The headphone set did not work, the transmitter light would not stay on, and there was mostly static when supposedly functioning - very disappointed. Am researching other reasonable headphone systems."
RH9V3XHEC3NV7,5,"Awesome unit. Has 3 channel frequencies and how you get audio from it is by turning an analog tuning knob on the side like an old time headset radio, but I'm not complaining, once it's set it works great. The range is not quite what they say it is but it can still reach through 3 walls. Light and very comfortable."
R21X108PL8WPKJ,4,"Clear reception, comfortable headware, no problems. wish I could say more but great is great, and no sense embellishing a great product."
R21UVBNKGWN7M8,3,"These are the best I have tried so far.<br /><br />For what I can afford, I just have not been able to find a static free set, for walking on my treadmill and watching my shows.<br /><br />Guess it's time to start saving and see if the more expensive ones are better. Maybe."
R7L6ETIZVOLWU,4,There just has not been enough tine to evaluate. Though they have lived up to my expectations and suspect this will not diminish.
R2EVKTGFYNO4K4,2,all the frequency. rather i can get a 3.5mm adapter jack and use it to hear my tv through it ! a much cheaper and better alternative if you just want to hear your tv while parents sleep.<br /><br />GTMax 3.5mm Female to 2 RCA Male Cable + headphones is better! cheaper and better BUT THAT WONT BE WIRELESS~!
R7PV556J6UHKF,1,Was really hoping these would work well but they didnt. About 2 days after using them the green on/off switch would randomly go off and they could not be used. I tried everything to adjust it and even moved it around and adjusted the audio connections but nothing resolved it. Now the light has not come back on for a few days. What i nightmare. Returing them today.
RUT1ZQN9QYF6U,4,"For right now I would not even rate it, but here is what happened. I bought this at Radio Shack, took it to the office, plugged it in and the red charging light came on. I came home and the charge light does not work. I went to the web site and guess what, in the process of registering it, I find the RS120 009920 that is my model is not recognized!! So, I cannot register it nor as yet am I able to troubleshoot the problem. It was on sale at RS, so maybe that is why, but for over $100 this is unacceptable. And tell me this, why is there no bluetooth gadget for my Philips smart tv? $20 should cover it, thinking tomorrow I will take it back and they better give me a full refund including the $12 warranty thing on the battery. I am going to search at RS now.<br />UPDATE:<br />The power jack was not all the way in! The space at the back of the transmitter is crowded and I had to use force to get it to seat. Make sure the volume is down b4 putting the headset on!! Static until the source is up and transmitting and it is loud. It is now charging and I have listened, sounds good. At first I did not thing the ear set was fitting good enough, but then if the bride is nest to me, it is good to be able to hear any attempt to converse."
R2N28R12CX5Z62,3,"To be honest the sound quality is not even close to what I was expecting, I guess next I need to go for the 200$ +"
R2DDWTG31X9T7R,3,"When I hooked up my Blu-Ray player with my TV, and then used this headphone connected to my TV to watch the movie, the background static noise is very obvious.<br />Using it with the DVD player or Dish DVR does not have this issue."
R2W7K4592V3JY6,5,The headphones are fantastic. Great sound they are comfortable to wear and stay charged for a good amour of time. They would make a great gift
R93HSS6K5XZS4,4,"I like these headphones a lot, except for the auto off function. The auto off \\""feature\\"" will kick in after a few min of inactivity...which results in a loud ass static noise that makes me almost poop myself at times. The person that created this \\""feature\\"" needs to be fired and have his nuts kicked a few times."
RRQ1HE4WDWS0Z,3,I was waiting eagerly for my headphones and I got this delivered today at my home.<br />The sound is Ok...But the curve is huge and these doesn't fit my head which is tiny compared to the size of this headphone.<br />I just had to return it and no other option as the headphones doesn't hold onto my ears and just fall off the head if I move a little.
RQZC9IICYTIKH,5,"Great sound and comfortable to wear!  It solved our problem in our bedroom where I wanted to watch TV but my husband wants to sleep.  And since he snores, I can now hear the tv and not him! :)"
R92EYTEEEM14G,5,these head phones are just about perfect.<br />i just use in our bedroom. wife can sleep. i can hear perfectly. no static good sound.
RL3EVZN6K49QN,4,"I had purchased TV Ears at Costco before this for use while watching TV.  They are tinny sounding, uncomfortable and prone to interference.  I took a chance and bought the Sennheiser earphones.  They work great - good sound, no interference.  The only reason I give less than 5 stars is because they get a little uncomfortable after a while and I have to take them off for a minute or so to give my ears a rest.  I think if there were some way to adjust the width of the headband it would solve this problem."
R35RUZL0SJO0KE,3,The product was very easy to install and hook up.  the one problem that we do have with it is that you hear the ambient sound in the room.  We happen to have 2 TVs in the room and my husband has trouble with the earphones and hearing the other TV.
RLR1WICMM6BFB,5,These wireless headphones work flawlessly.  We have a summer home and a winter home and I now have a set at both places.  Keeps peace in the household when one of us wants to watch TV while the other is sleeping.  Can't go wrong with these!
R3O5A9XXDLKTKU,3,"It didn't work in my tv becuase it has an optical outlet....gosh I can't even remember.  Just make sure this connector will connect to your tv.  Mine was a pain in the booty to set up.  I ended up having to buy a converter and another cable for an extra $30.  It is a good signal, not great.  The actual headphones are a little uncomfortable.  Just ok."
R2QGSCA9XXL6CF,5,the stereo sound quality is great for me. a hearing impairment of high frequency sounds requires volume of music to be too high  when listening to normal stereo loudspeakers. It bothers other people in the environment. With this system I can better enjoy music even as I wander throughout the house and not disturb others.
R3FPLASH08GIZX,5,"I bought these for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. She is slightly hard of hearing, and no longer enjoyed watching movies. She loves them! They have given her the ability to distinguish the words in movies.Now she and her grandchildren can enjoy watching movies again! Highly recommend! Thanks Amazon for shipping these to her, she received them in time for Mother's Day! It is great being a Prime Member!"
R1EMNSCZ3IYO2U,1,I got it out of the box. Set it up. It was working fine for a couple of days. One fine day I was using it and the static sound blasted in my ears ... almost deafening and the thing never worked afterwards. Maybe I got a lemon. Not sure but i promptly returned it.
R37MCQR11JM2ME,3,"It's okay, a little white noise which I could live with, but those headsets are so cumbersome, wished they would have had earbuds instead of the big earphones, it would be so much nicer when laying in bed."
R8NOBX827EWHC,5,"I love it.  It meets or exceeds all my expectations.  I love the fact that I can listen to the headset with the option of having the \\""room\\"" sound on my TV (a 50\\"" Sony) turned on or off.  I have some hearing loss, so this headset has greatly improved my ability to enjoy movies, particularly those that have some scenes where the diction is not easily understood.  Also, other activities and conversations in the room are easily blocked out allowing me to hear whatever I am watching.  This was a great buy!<br /><br />CSR<br />Plano, TX"
R3KDBGJWX32XEF,1,"It won't work with my digital big screen TV, which I was shocked about since the TV I have is common.  I'm trying to find an adapter, but it will be more costly."
R37MW4ZR8QSQM0,5,"I have titnitus in my ears, so a lot of times I hear, but don't hear the word right. With these headphones I can adjust the volume right at the ear. And the quality of the sound is impressive. I know they will go at least 150' feet, and no fading or static. I like every thing about them but 1 thing. The do not fit tight enough, keep sliding off if you look down or up. Besides that, they are far the best wireless ones I've had. Was going to get another pair for my wife, but they slide of her head even worst than my head. But I WOULD recommend them to any one that is looking to buy wireless headphones.<br /><br />  Newman"
R5N4U23W685VA,5,"worked perfectly right out of the box, it's really nice to be able to hear the dialogue on all my movies & t.v. programming.  I've even left them on to listen to music outside on my patio, have a great range"
R118T05X0CSG9N,5,These headphones work great.  They are used mostly when exercising on a treadmill so that the volume of the tv does not have to be cranked up.  The sound is excellent.  Having the charging stand and rechargeable batteries just makes it that much nicer.  We had tried cheaper versions that did not work.  These are a keeper.
RFUWAYFX410R6,5,This is my second set to be used in the great room. The user is happy with the quality of sound as am I.
RJWP0V19QXETV,2,I have three sets. My first two sets do fine for t v listening. The third set has an annoying shadow sound of the singers voice in the background along with the regular voice. I don't like it! Any ideas? I have to use the R C A adapter to plug into my stereo.
RE8RPZNKHY8HI,5,"They are not Bose, but most of us can't tell the differences in the sound quality, but we can tell the difference in the price. That gives it a 5-star in my book. The set-up is easy and you can walk around and still hear the TV. Or, you can list to one thing and let the rest of the family watch that stuff you're not watching, but listening to anyway.<br /><br />Good quality, good bass - I thought the sound was excellent, but then I am a little hard of hearing. So why spend a bunch of money?"
R1OPE2ZEV6SLWK,5,Headphones are really great! Sound is incredible and headphones are very comfortable. They work anywhere I walk throughout my house and even in the yard. Have recommended this item to friends!
R1J4R2RG93J229,3,"The number one thing that is wrong about this headset is it's timeout setting. If you are wearing your headphones, but not listening to anything for about 5 minutes, the phones will go into standby mode, and you will be treated to a massive bast of static on full volume. Ouch. And this seems to happen every time I use them. This may be user error, but it still sucks."
R1RL0RJRY3P9NA,4,Works well. Easy to adapt to my set up; just plugged into my amp and o.k. from there for all that I needed. Can hear TV thru whole house with earphones on. Only difficulty has been being sure to be careful of headphones coming off if bending down. Regard it as a good purchase.
R3RNI0AF0KFR9U,5,Sennheiser RS120 headphones are very comfortable and the controls on the earpiece make it easy to change the volume.  I especially like the fact that it is always recharging itself while on the cradle.  All in all and excellent product and I would recommended it to anyone trying to save their spouses' hearing because the volume on the TV is too loud. This is my 2nd. set.
R3ATVLQVQ21PCF,3,"Then problem was that the conections didn't work in some of them. After getting working connections, it was good sound."
RS92R2HRCRU55,4,"Got this a while back but don't really use it much...<br />Think hard about your application and how often you will be using it before you buy.<br /><br />Either way, it's a good product."
R8OZNF6NMBU5C,4,"It's just what I needed. A good wireless headphone for a very good price. So far so great. Only downside is that as it is RF, sometimes I get interference but I just need to ajust my head a little and it's gone."
RPKO2SHK64GCT,4,"These do work, and the sound range and detail is particularly good.  The charging works well, and the sound isolation is fantastic.  I can basically only hear what's coming through the headphones when they're on with something coming through, and nobody can hear what's coming through but me.  However, I have an underlying chirp coming through mine every few seconds.  When the volume is higher, there's absolutely no issue.  In soft volume, it's a bit of a nuisance."
R1BAYLFEGA1Y4U,5,"A great value, Sounds are clear and volume adjustments are easy to use. Provides great independence is adjusting sounds.<br />Great buy.<br />Bought one for my wife and one for me."
R1ZPU59KBZ28PW,3,"This is my third  set of Sennheiser headphones-all of which are still in use. I decided on these after reading several good reviews and only  because the RS-85's had been discontinued, I still have a set of RS-85's I purchased in 2006 and they sound as good today as they did when new.<br /> However, I needed a second set for my downstairs den as I have bad hearing due to playing music most of my younger years-using Sennheiser products even way back then. Back in the day Sennheiser products were made in Germany and had a high standard of quality. Today unfortunately, like most everything else they are made in China and the quality is, shall we say, not as good<br /> The RS-120's have a slightly better charging stand as the RS-85's. These are much easier to get it right the first time. The RS-85's have 'slots' that the earpeices must fit into perfectly to insure charging whereas the RS-120's just pretty much 'hang' on the metal rails (see photo).<br /> The sound quality is still quite good although not as good as it's predecessor. The RS-85's cup around your ear and you get a great simulated surround sound effect. The RS120's are actually quite awkward in that you have to turn them around and wear them backwards for more or a natural feel. They are &#34;on the ear&#34; as opposed to the ear surround type.<br /> I've found that they lose signal by just walking upstairs to the other part of my house. You pretty much have to turn them down or off when you wallk out of the room as the static and interference is quite loud and annoying. With the RS-85's I can still walk anywhere in my house and even walk outside the house on the porch and not lose signal.<br /> The volume control and the tuning wheel are side by side and it is awkward adjusting the volume sometimes as the tuning knob is on the bottom and inevitably I reach up and turn it first thinking it is the volume control and get an earful of static-sometimes very loud!<br /> All in all though, for the price they arenot too bad for wireless phones. I paid more than twice that amount for the RS-85's 7 yrs ago. I haven't owned them  long enough to just quality in that respect or how long the batteries last. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Hope this helps......."
R3U5FX8X75PCBE,4,"Very convenient cordless rechargeable headphones. I use them a lot for viewing video on the computer as they allow me freedom to move around a bit, especially if doing work on the adjacent laptop, without a cable getting in the way. Although the fit could be better, there are no problems. Don't use them for gaming."
R2BK0R3N8CU1K2,5,This is such a great product. My husband likes to watch tv while I prefer to read. Lets us both do what we like!
RHIBX47Q7DF3W,5,"I needed something to watch TV in bed without bothering anyone.  These fit the bill.  Sound quality is good, not great but being my first pair of wireless headphones and for TV use only, no complaints.  Love the charging cradle, looks good and is easy to keep them stored and ready to go.  Range is plenty for my use as I am less than 20' from base.  Easy to tune and plenty of volume.  No hiss or background noise.  I have them directly connected to my TV, with the use of a digital (toslink) to analog (rca) converter (Conversions Technology HDE).  These only have Analog RCA inputs, and most newer TV's only have Digital outputs so you will want to check your source output to confirm. Turn off the TV speakers and they work perfectly.  Comfortable and lightweight."
R2T6FK2JI2QI1K,1,I ordered this product on 19th May and received on 1st June 2013 due to &#34;Possible delay in delivery due to arrival at incorrect carrier facility&#34;. When I opened my mailbox I found the package box was damaged and opened. I'm very much disappointed with the service & product which is not working as expected. So I'm returning this product. This headphone is not charging and not compatible with my TV Philips 40PFL7705dv/f7.<br /><br />Pros<br />Sound clarity is awesome<br /><br />Cons<br />Too BIG for head<br />Tuning is makes your life hell<br />This headphone is not charging and not compatible with my TV Philips 40PFL7705dv/f7.
R14KQ3ZJTW8LGQ,4,"They have good sound quality for the price, the charging via the holder is convenient although you must pull the phones straight up to avoid knocking over the base."
R2K94CVL2LMTJ2,1,Unfortunately when connected I receive and electric static discharge from the ear muffs. They feel like I am going to be electrocuted by them every-time I get sapped. I am still looking for a wireless headset that won't electrocute me or sapped me. But where?
R1XW9HET6DDWA2,5,Sennheiser headphones are good quality and comfortable to wear.  My husband uses these when he watches television that might disturb others in the house.
R2VBENNYIYT70C,4,The headphones work great. The sound quality was good and you could hear sound from quite a distance away. We bought two sets.
R2O6Z9BREO6U3K,4,The sound is good most of the time. Sometimes it gets a little staticky but In general it is a good product and would recommend it
RF8HGG72XAL33,5,Headphones are great wherever I am in the house.  Works great for late night viewing the TV.  Stops the increased volumn on the ads.
R2TGYHZE0NXZYS,3,"I got this used from Amazon so the price was lower and still appeared like new in the box. It makes hiss even when standing next to the antenna, one of the 3 selectable channels was a bit better but I will use these less because of the hiss and would have returned them if I paid full price. The concept is good and reception will go through multiple metal walls.<br /><br />Edit - a few days later - hiss not as bad as the first day of use(after charging) but still present. They stay on my head pretty well without feeling too tight, due to the large surface area of the full ear coverage. I like a sensible volume level but it occurs to me that many won't like these because as soon as you try to turn up the volume to rock out or drown out ambient noise, the distortion becomes quite bad. Worth a try if you want moderate volume levels. but the volume amp needs to be re-designed."
R2IL4XZKNXN3DE,2,"Just returned these. Three major problems and one annoyance.<br /><br />Problem one - the transmitter base did not always turn on when the headphones were turned on. This happened twice within 10 days. Had to unplug and re-plug the power cord to get them to work again. This was a major hassle because the wall outlet is behind my stereo rack.<br /><br />Problem two - the volume would suddenly drop to about a third of what it was then it would slowly increase back. This would happen about every 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />Problem three - hard to tune to eliminate all hiss and static. Almost always present.<br /><br />Annoyance - If you have a human sized head, these will not stay on.<br /><br />When these worked properly, they were great. But, my pair only worked properly about 20 percent of the time."
RKYF5CPAQFLAQ,2,"I have a slightly smaller head so these headphones do not fit tight against my head.  If I bend my head down, the headphones fall off.  I had an awesome and cheap set of Radio Shack wireless headphones that lasted me for years that did not have this problem.  The difference, I believe, is the Radio Shack headphones have cupped ear pads, while the RS120 ear pads are completely flat.  There is nothing for them to hang on to.  I would have bought the Radio Shack headphones again if they still made them, but was forced to try something else.<br /><br />I ended up tieing a string around the back to keep the headphones from falling off my head while I am working and listening at the same time."
R3T7O3ESXQENS7,5,"A friend suggested the headphones while wintering in FL.  We purchased a pair for my husband but the problem was the fact that I liked them too!  The volume of TV can be off and you are able to listen while someone else in the room is napping...reading....on the computer, etc. When we returned north for the summer I purchased TWO sets of them.  They really are great for many of the TV shows where the dialogue is difficult to pick up.  We LOVE them and highly recommend them."
RTQPWR7P7FZP0,5,Was exactly what we were looking for. Works great. Great price. Don't care much for how it charges. Nice quality.
RYTXFNRCPOPHZ,1,"not worth a dime. They quit just a few days after the warranty ran out. Don't waste your money, they are cheap and work cheap."
R2U224AGGXVKXC,5,"I have some hearing loss, found them to be comfortable, excellent sound  would recommend them over tv ears which I tried before buying those"
R18WXEM6DIGXJL,5,"I got these for my husband who uses them everyday allday at work. He loves them, if we ever needed another pair we would get these. Why pay for the price of the Beats when these are cheeper and just as nice"
RVTCC6MLDUS51,3,Got these to replace some 8yr old Sony's that were just falling apart.  These Sennheiser's work ok but they fit funny on your head.  They don't lay exactly flat against your ears but I use them in bed so I can live with it.
RRZ17GU4LWQ2G,5,Sennheoser is a Master of sound reproduction and this unit personifies that title..It charges up just fine in the unique charging holder and is comfortable on the ears during use...
R1XVRS1JQESB8L,5,I have a these headphones for myself and love them.  I gave these to my sister and she is enjoying them too.  Sound is great and they are light and fit good.
R5OZLZRH8ILJ0,4,"I like the sound, the quality is very good. You do have to do some adjustment to Zero-in on the best sound signal and volume levels but once they are set the sound is clear with no distortion, I can move around the room and I hear no change in the sound quality. I did not like the fit of the headset, they fit loose and if you move your head forward the headset tends to fall off of your head."
R68L87FX8TZKR,3,"I ordered these as the RS 130, which I have and like is no longer available.  They work fine, but my desire was a headset with which I could walk around the house.  These turned out to be On-Ear, which means they fall off if you move too much and/or lower your head to pick up or adjust something.<br /><br />I would not buy another pair and wonder why they are not as advertised??"
RKRJTG0LJ67PP,5,"Obtained this product to replace another one that started to malfunction after 5 years of fairly regular use. The sound quality is excellent, and the wireless function makes the headphones much more convenient to use."
R123LA9N674RP9,2,"The headphones are good as far as sound quality and ease of use, but there is one glaring fault that makes these more trouble than they are worth that forces me to give this product a poor review and will cause me to ultimately look for a new pair of wireless headphones.  The problems lies with the fact that the connection between the headphones and the base unit drops after a minute or two with no audio playing, causing a static sound to come through the headphones.  This is probably intended functionality where the base unit stops broadcasting to the headphones when no audio is being played (maybe to preserve battery life?) - but it's very annoying to have to turn on/off the headphones every time I want to watch a video clip or listen to something - and, if I forget to turn them off after I've finished, I'm reminded a minute later with the unpleasant static noise being blasted into my ears.  The other annoying part is that it takes a few seconds for the headphones to recognize that audio has started again, so I miss out on about the first five seconds of audio when I begin a clip and have to rewind once the headphones finally stop the static and turn back on.  In short, the product works - but the annoyance factor outweighs the good and I just cannot recommend this product."
R2BOTUEGU1MNZG,4,"This is a very nice unit. Works fine for TV viewing. Stays connected while moving around the house to refill coffee, etc. Price of this model makes this a very good value, in my opinion"
RQ1EH4LZ3Q67S,4,Headphones work great.  Green LED power light goes on and off for no reason.  Power is still there with headphones still being charged since red LED light is on.
R2Y2743RWGHZ0W,4,They work well through most of my home - if they'd work throughout my home I'd have given them a 5 star rating
R2BOXEHYOLFLD8,1,"Much interference in the sound, if I change my positions I can hear the sound anymore, if I change the volume I can't hear the sound too .... much instable operation. Anyway, I should have bought a Infrared headphone ...."
R3SE56STMN2JG7,1,"I did not buy it for listening enjoyment. I have a hearing problem and need an amplifier to hear the TV.  I was replacing a ten year old Radio Shack model which was great, other than I had worn them out.  The Sennheiser, which was supposed to be top drawer, had a lot of static.  You have to tune in the frequency, and the comfort level was terrible as the ear pieces do not fit well at all.  I returned it and bought a Sony which was cheaper, and which I am well pleased with."
RKXVWC00ZLWB9,5,"We had a problem understanding words that were being said on TV.  But these headphones are great, it makes the words so much clearer."
R1TIQ5851HVY04,5,"I bought this for my husband as one of his Christmas presents last year, and he has declared this being one of the best Christmas presents he ever received!<br /><br />I can certainly see why after trying it for myself, and now I want to buy one for myself except I am trying to cut down my TV time.  :)<br /><br />The headset is very well cushioned, so it is comfortable even with hours of use.  The sound quality is very good, I enjoy it even more than the surround sound through the speakers without it."
R959I3JLXNIOB,5,"Got this for my husband.  He turns the tv up so loud, I can hear it in the bedroom clearly.  Something had to be done. This was a perfect solution.  Sound is very clear.  The battery charge lasts well beyond his normal tv watching time.  Hook-up was simple enough.  He says headphones are comfortable - even after 3-4 hours.  Highly recommend"
R2DOSORO900IGY,4,"Sounds good, range is good, battery life is good and easy charging but the fit is not nearly as good as others I've had. Not really a good fit on headband or ear muff but something I can live with."
R1TAMEZBPZWWOH,5,i live in a condo there are people above me and when i want to watch tv i just put them on and  chill out i would recommend this item  the sound is great
R29ZG8PX09O89K,5,"I many times have trouble sleeping and need time to decompress from the stressful day by watching a comedy on TV. My husband needs his sleep and the TV keeps him up. These headphones are the answer!  I'd never tried headphones before. You can use these to listen to your TV, iPad and iPhone music etc. THE SOUND AND CLARITY ARE AMAZING!  They make a TV with awful speakers sound rich in bass and give it a deep, full sound. Amazing!  I love these!  I want to wear them even when hubby is awake they sound so good!"
R52XAETAB0UVA,5,"I shopped at Radio Shack and Best Buy first and both store carried these headphones, and both stores said they were excellent and worked quite well. So I ordered them from Amazon and saved some money. I got them in a couple days. Unpacked the box, followed the simple instructions and charged them for 2 days before I used them, even though it was an 18 hour minimum first time charge, I was away and had no opportunity to use them. The first time I turned them on it took a few minutes figuring out how to tune it in on the freq dial. I had a small amount of hissing and static, but after switching channels on the base unit and trying settings I finally got a crystal clear perfect connection with no hiss no static, nothing but clean crystal clear sound. I am hearing things I never heard through the tv speakers. My TV is a Panasonic Viera 42\\"" plasma. I hooked it up to the audio out RCA jacks on the back. These headphones exceed my wildest expectations. I can roam around the house from one end to the other and the sound never varies. I am very happy and will recommend them to anyone."
R32GLBR1BVO9N8,4,"Had construction going on next door to me, so I purchased this wireless set of earphones. Had a bit of a time setting them up, so I contacted their customer service which sent me an easy to read set of instructions."
R1IKFR7VAVX6WQ,1,I would have returned them but couldn't locate the invoice.<br />Constant static and the hearphones did not fit my ears comfortably.<br />They have a cheap quality that doesn't compare to the amount they cost.<br />It seems to have been a waste of time and money.
RJ88LGR181D1C,4,I am happy with the RS120 wireless headphones but the finetuning feature should have a greater range. The sound is clear and without interference.
R3QVMG59WWCPL7,5,For the price these are a great purchase. Good sound quality and good cordless range. You can even hear in another room.
R1R45YRTMG54NL,5,These work great for me.  And I bought a set for my father last month and he loves them too.
RRSR2PRS722ED,1,"1) The ads lead you to believe these are over the ear phones that help block out surrounding noise, they're not.  They only sit on the ear with no insulation and that leads to major irritation after 15 minutes.<br />2)  Turning the head results in a loss of signal even at 10 feet producing a staticy Fup Fup sound.<br />3)  Often completely drops reception from the TV resulting in nothing but static.  Sometimes this can be remedied by turning up the TV's volume but often the TV has to be turned off and back on.<br />4)  Does have impressive range but with the other issues why bother.<br />I bought a cheap $25 wireless headset that performs much better."
R2ZQQ1JZ1H4CUK,5,The head phones have excellant sound reproduction. They carry the sounds throught my home and out to my patio. They maintain constant clear signals as I walk about the area.<br /><br /> The ear coverings on the head phones is not as comfortable as they could be. They feel a bit abrasive on my ears.
R1QG8HGCXVZ8YU,5,"Love the way the sound comes through these headphones!  Think it may be even better than the sound from my TV!  Also, I can walk all around my house which is an added bonus!"
RFQYTUA25ZNLN,5,"Got these for my parents and in-laws, all in there 80s. They can now watch their shows without having all of the neighbors having to listen also."
R3JEAIF3I0T816,5,"I've had these for 2 months now and really enjoy them. They work as advertised and as another rater mentions, I have noticed a buzz sometimes. It's not real noticeable, usually only when the volume is very low. I can walk thru the house and still hear what's on tv. The hook up was easy and once they were dialed in, which took all of 5 seconds, they worked great. I can turn the volume down low on the tv, but not all the way down. My wife has even had to turn it up, even though I could hear great, because the level was set so low. I recommend these highly."
R1P3SKGGPGOYPB,5,"My wife likes watching TV in bed. I like sleeping. The headphones are perfect! Easy to set up, plug and play. Range is great."
R2PBDR7JW99SNF,3,"I'm head is larger than the average head, so it pinches a bit, but the sound is good and the product works as advertised.  It's not their fault I have a big head - LOL.<br /><br />Not related to the product:  one note for those who want to connect this to an HD TV.  Make sure you have an &#34;out&#34; that you can connect this to.  I have an LG HDTV and there are virtually no audio outs, only &#34;ins&#34;. I looked for hours, read the manuals, looked up forums and yep, nothing to connect it, too.  I finally connected it to my cable box, but can only use it for cable programs, not DVDs or internet streaming.  There is a work around using an HDMI out, but you have to buy more hardware."
R1KGU08B5SV6S6,1,"I don't usually write reviews but with this time I feel I have to. this product is a shame for Sennheiser. It is (very) poorly designed - Inside & out. You know that because it 'behaves&#34; inconsistently. It works, then stops, then start again but with a lot of distortion and then stops again. And so on, until it drops dead on you (which it did). Now, what's infuriating is that with such &#34;behaviour&#34; you tend to think that something is wrong with yourself (!) and that you simply don't know how to operate the damn thing. Even when it stops working completely you think it is your fault because you did something wrong. (And I run a home network for 5 Pcs and 6 mobile devices, wired and wierless, with a VPN, Home sharing on content and NAS all with no problems ...)<br />In short: SAVE YOUR CASH ! this product is half baked at best, It is bad for you, bad for your blood pressure and IMO should not be sold !"
R1CHMILG58ETX6,3,So far I cannot get rid of a loud humming.  If I can't get rid of this I might return.  Might as well buy cheap ones if the sound is going to be that bad.
R3PG5UXQGWQPV4,5,My mother wanted this for her birthday so she can watch TV at night without disturbing my father while he was sleeping.  She loves them and it was easy enough for her to hook up.  It arrived very quickly and sooner than stated on the order.
R1B1L80069M1CC,5,These are great despite the cost you have to try them! I swear it really reduces the sound in you home!
R1SKXNP7HKGBTR,4,"The headphones have decent sound quality. The wireless transmission compresses the signal, and until I realized that took a little getting used to.<br /><br />It has great range. I can go from one side of my house to the other without losing signal.<br /><br />The only thing I really don't like is how they fit. The angle of the ear pieces forces the headphones too far forward, so I have to be careful how I move or they slip off."
R2Y906KRDFI8V2,4,"I bought these headphones last week refurbished from a licensed re-seller. The two rechargeable AAA batteries need 24hrs for their initial charge. When I tried the headphones for the first time, I was unfortunately quite underwhelmed. There was quite a bit of static and a high-pitched whine (kind of like with low-quality active noise-cancelling headphones). I called Sennheiser support and the first thing the guy asked me was if I had the volume on the source device turned up high. I did not. This fixed the problem entirely. The higher the volume on the source device, and stronger the signal. The actual volume reaching your ears can be regulated via the volume knob on the headphones themselves.<br /><br />The sound quality will be good -- even in a high-RF traffic environment -- but not perfect.<br /><br />If you are an audiophile, consider yourself warned. These are not for you.<br /><br />If you're like 99% of headphone users, these will work great for you and I suspect you'll be satisfied. I know I am."
R10N8MGD9W1DKJ,5,"Well made, great sounding, great fitting, and powerful signal strength describe these headphones. They have a static free range of 300' and can be used outdoors while working in the yard. Perfect item for watching that late night movie without waking the dead. Sennheiser continues to impress with their full line of headphones. I now have noise cancelling earbuds, corded over the ear headphones and these wireless on ear style in my Sennheiser collection and i am very happy with all of them."
R39DPN3Z9LVG1M,4,I use it in the bedroom and my wife doesn't complain about how loud the TV is anymore. Love it.
R1Q6BDIQQXSX0E,1,"Not worth the money.  I've been an audiophile for 40 years and a fan of Sennheiser for many years.  This product is a poor representation of Sennheiser quality.  I plug it into a high quality Denon receiver's headphone jack and sit no more than 10 feet away from the transceiver and get poor sound quality at best, regardless of which of the three channels I chose or what tuning I select.<br /><br />While the headset is reasonably light, the ear cushions are not comfortable for any length of time.  They feel like wearing drywall.<br /><br />What really makes me hate this product is the unit's propensity to produce sudden and high volume noise without me moving my head.  Unpredictable and potentially ear drum damaging.  Imagine listening to your favorite music or TV show at 60 decibels then ALL OF A SUDDEN hearing a pop of 110 decibel noise.<br /><br />I am close to sending this back for full refund.  I will try a few more positions for the transceiver, but doubt it will help.<br /><br />I'm really sorry I bought these, and my respect for Sennheiser has degraded, even though I have two other Sennheiser products in my possession.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this set.<br /><br />E.H. Bork"
R3JN3UHGYAIPQD,5,"My Mom has hearing problems and it had limited her enjoyment of watching TV. The Sennheiser RS120 allows her to control the volume while she watches TV. It worked so well we bought a 2nd one for her bedroom TV.<br /><br />We had bought a previous headphone type that rested in the ear, however it made her ear sore. The only drawback to this model is that if you wear them for long periods of time they will make your ears warm."
R30JKQDGAS7O0M,1,"Base  (charger) works sometimes. {power cord seems to be fine) The unit does not turn on. Bad connection in the cradle unit???????  A  gentle  tap on the bottom, will sometimes get it to work!!!!!!  Made in China... Could that be that the reason??"
R3CFIU6E66CUU1,1,"I bought these for my father and me.  His stopped working within 30 days, mine within 60.  No reception, static, buzzing in the ears.  NEVER recommend this to ANYONE!!!<br />SUX!"
R1G4B50FY7ZQV8,5,"Bought this for an elderly relative. The tv volume went from 60 to 12!  Was the best investment we could have made!  Sound is great, clear, and it is easy for an 85 year old to use."
R3IT4QTXNMJOOQ,5,"This is the best wireless TV headset I ever purchased. Never heard of Sennheiser brand but it was recommended by my AV expert. The range is over 350 feet with good clarity over the entire range. My only less that excellent experience is in placing the headset on the charger rack. Care must be taken to assure contact, even though the two exposed bars in the headband appear to be in contact with the charging bar. A red light confirms that the headset is charging. Some adjusting to get contact is necessary."
R15KUHJC9OBY8Y,5,Bought these for my dad who kept blasting the speakers wide open. He is very happy now that he can watch whatever in total comfort.<br />The replaceable Ni-Cad batteries are a nice touch.<br />Good build finish and excellent reception.
R1KMUZ8E9VLPM3,5,"I purchased the headphones because I live in an apartment and I do not want to worry about disturbing neighbors late in the evening while watching sports or an intense movie. By 10:00 each evening, I bring out the headphones. Actually, I look forward to wearing them. The sound is so clear and they cut out all of the extraneous sound that we become used to trying to filter with our brains (e.g. dogs barking, sirens from passing first responders, children playing in the neighborhood, etc.).<br /><br />The sound coming through the headphones is so clear that it is not necessary to have the volume as high as when using the television speakers. Since the headphones are wireless, I can exit the room and stay up with the dialogue while I'm popping the popcorn or grabbing a drink. I have found so many perks to having the headphones!! I think I'm going to purchase a set of headphones for my dad for Father's Day!  He is hard of hearing, but cannot disturb the neighbors in his apartment building. He can use the headphones while my mom uses the regular speakers at a lower volume. Problem solved!  Recently, he asked me about headphones and whether they are difficult to connect. It's a wonderful opportunity for me because he is impossible to buy for.<br /><br />I absolutely am hooked on these headphones!"
R183DIEHIZUDG9,5,"I bought this set for my husband. He is retired and likes to watch tv late at night, however I work and the noise keeps me awake. The headphones has been really used and enjoyed by both of us. We love them."
RS5SXVSNN632O,5,works great. So much better than TV ears and less cost and got it in one day. Happy house again. :)
RPJPY2D7NOCMW,5,"I was having trouble understanding the dialog on some programs so I decided to try these as an alternative to turning the volume to obnoxious levels (which didn't help much anyway).  These headphones were easy to set up and work great, highly recommended."
R24I53PAZFCQLG,5,I bought these for my husband because he's a night owl and I'm an early bird. I can't sleep with the TV on so this was a perfect solution. I sleep fine and he stays in bed instead of spending time on the couch. We also had him use these while playing PSIII. Great product. I would reccommend to all my friends.
RGUVOJAU9YWW2,4,"After researching Sony, RCA, and Sennheiser wireless headphones our office settled on the Sennheiser RS-120's and we have no regrets. These are excellent headphones. We particularly liked the fact that we could walk all around the office filled with electronics and heard no interference.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent. They work great for music, TV, and movies.  There is some spotty static in a couple places but it does not interfere with the sound that much.<br /><br />We really like the fact that they are lightweight, yet sturdy. And they are very comfortable as well.  The rechargeable batteries are a great idea, too. We liked the fact that we did not have to be attached to a cord and that we could simply place the headphones on the base unit and charge it up<br /><br />Set up was effortless just open the package and get the product working without having to reference the instructions or manual just plug and play that help us order more for the rest of the team."
R1BPU8ZQZ1F892,2,"I needed an headset for my workplace, and I was initially very excited about the design of this headset and its super convenient recharging base. Also, I noticed that it was possible to buy additional headsets, so I thought that it would be a great product.<br /><br />However,  I was disappointed! The headset and charger have 3 different possible channels. I tried all of them, and couldn't obtain a clear audio signal on any. If you play loud music, it won't be too noticeable (because it will drown the noise); but during silences (or when playing more &#34;subtle&#34; music), you will hear significant background static noise.<br /><br />I thought that it could have been Wi-Fi interference or something like that (we have lots of wireless networks at my workplace), but the headset is supposed to be 926MHz and Wi-Fi is 2.4GHz (and 5Ghz), so unless the headset is poorly shielded, that shouldn't have been an issue... In doubt, I'm giving it 2 stars, but I returned it anyway."
R29G7KGLHNDNSG,5,"With hearing aids, I couldn't hear the TV sound very well even when I had it loud enough that the sound irritated my wife in another room.  This is my second one (not the exact model) and both are plugged into the cable box with the TV sound off (sometimes music sounds better if you use the TV sound also).  I was worried that the one downstairs would interfere with the one in the upstairs bedroom but they can be tuned to be discrete.  The only downside is loud commercials blaring directly in your ears.  I only watch recorded TV so I fast forward past the ads."
R1M2CLSS8N9FEC,5,"I have had my headphones about 3 weeks now and I couldn't be any more pleased with them.  They are comfortable, but I have a small head so I have to be careful so that they don't fall off, but that isn't that much of a problem.  It is so nice to be able to understand every word spoken on the television.  I just wish that I had bought them sooner."
R34FACI0F1BLBR,4,Set up was easy.  They work great.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the ear pieces.  Not extremly comfortable and everyone around me can hear what I'm hearing. Disappointing.
R277B7V3MX2NEI,4,The sound quality is very good for watching tv without bothering anyone else in the room but they are bulky.
R9PNA87ARNH77,5,My husband had previously owned 2 sets of headphones from Radio Shack and neither of them lasted very long.  He loves these.  He said the sound is much clearer and he can hear at a much further distance when he's walking around the house.  I truly believe you get what you paid for.  We had a question on hooking them up and called Sennheiser's technical support and they were very helpful and we were able to hook up without any problem.  Delivery was also very prompt.  No hesitation is recommending this item.
R2ZU8CBT2BLYKM,5,"Love it!!  I have a hearing problem and TV was useless to me because I couldn't separate the sounds or understand what anybody was saying.  Everything was just echos.  I know, bad TV sound quality.  Nevertheless, the Sennheiser RS120 fixed the problem and I can watch a movie again.  The transmitter plugs directly into the cable TV box, so the sound signal doesn't even go through the TV's electronics.  Of course it could also be plugged into the TV's audio output if desired.  The headset volume can be adjusted without disturbing the TV's sound or other listeners.  In fact, with it plugged into the cable box, I can actually turn the TV off and still listen to the audio.  Makes it nice for listening to classic country music and my wife doesn't have to complain!  The headphones are good quality and fit me well.  If I had to find a fault, I'd say the headphones could stand to be a bit tighter fit.  They may be a bit loose for small heads or a child.<br /><br />Would I recommend it to a friend?  Absolutely.  In fact, I already have.  Some have tried it on and they love it too."
R3BGD0MUG8TC49,5,Great I should of bought them a year ago. Now the volume can be on low and I can still hear with my headphones
R1D8JW9MCSJYRX,4,"Bought these for watching DVDs and movies that aren't closed captioned since I suffer a slight hearing loss.  So I'm not critical about music quality or roaming capability, though they are more than acceptable in both categories. They're great for what I bought them for.  They are a little large for small heads, like mine, but you can wear them tilted slightly forward and they're comfortable, but will slide around if you move about."
R1QDIZLGZ1050R,5,really helps to be able to hear the new programs while my wife can tune the volume down  There is no interference in the sound
RS78M5VYKTAT2,3,"I bought this a while back and never use it now. It got the job done for the most part, but there was always a static buzzing and no matter how much I tried to fine tune the settings, the sound quality always seemed sub par. I live in an apartment complex where almost every apartment has their own wi-fi running so maybe this was causing interference, and you may have better luck in a normal neighborhood house. But for me these were a waste of money."
R3UOPVVSWNQCV3,5,These headphones are great for a person that has trouble hearing.  They exceeded my expectations for clarity and I am able to walk outside while still hearing perfectly.  The only problem is that the instructions are not easy to understand. It is not difficult at all but I had to figure out how/where to plug them in properly myself.
R1H5ID93AR8RU4,1,"I just received this in the mail and unpacked it. Within 15 minutes of use it was clear it needed to go straight back.<br /><br />The RF transmission simply doesn't work. I'm sitting at my desk 1.5m from the transmitter and the reception goes in and out when I turn my head. It doesn't just lose reception, it makes an excruciatingly loud interference sound, which is uncomfortable and deafening.<br /><br />The claim that it goes through walls and up to 326 feet is also a barefaced lie. As soon as I walk barely around the corner 5m from my desk, the reception disappears 100% and it's just loud noise. If I walk away from my desk and there is nothing in between me and the transmitter, it works fine up to about 10m (30ft) and then the sound completely disappears and the deafening noise takes over again.<br /><br />Not usable when on the move, and not even usable when sitting right in front of the transmitter. Do not buy this product!"
ROA7I4LENIA15,5,"I purchase this product to replace an older set of Acoustic Research wireless headphones that had begun falling apart after many years of use. I use them with my television when I don't want to disturb my wife, or when I am having trouble understanding dialog. I found them very easy to connect and set up and have been very pleased with the sound quality. The old AR headphones I had generated a fair amount of &#34; white noise&#34; when there was no or low volume sound coming from the TV and were prone to static and popping when I moved my head. The Sennheiser RS-120s do generate a small amount of &#34;white noise&#34; when there is no sound coming from the programming I am watching, however, it is minimal and I have had no problem with the static or popping I experienced with my old AR headphones. The base unit is fairly compact and I have had no trouble with the headset charging points lining up properly when I hang them on it. The issue othes have described where the headphones will begin making a loud static noise when you pause your TV or DVD player for more than a few minutes can be avoided by simply switching the headphones on/off switch to the the off position. Once you are ready to resume watching your program, hit play and slide the on/off switch to the on position. Overall, I have been very pleasantly surprised with the quality and performance of the Sennheiser RS-120s. For the money, I don't think you can go wrong with buying this set of wireless headphones."
RC5AHWFU8V399,5,"I ordered the headphones to replace my 7 YO one. The batteries would not hold a charge and the earpieces were falling disintegrating. After I ordered them, I noticed I could purchase the earpieces and Amazon Rechargeable batteries. Made sense so I sent back this one (after briefly entertaining the idea of having 2 pair. one for my office/TV area - 1 for my bedroom. Since I don't watch much TV in my room, they were returned. Shipping was PRIME- LOVE LOVE LOVE AMAZON PRIME!!"
R2L6R2WFGRN11F,2,The sound is good but the design of the earphones is poor. The surface of the earpieces is flat and hard. As a result they do not grip the ears. When you tilt your head forward the earphones slide off into your lap or fall to the floor.<br />Other earphones fit over your ears rather than merely press against the surface of the ear.
R33Q2QLZMJ2R1N,5,This item was purchased for my husband who has tinnitus and turns the volume on the TV up too high for me.  Now he can hear it as loud as he needs to and allows me to watch TV in comfort.
R8M0X394GD0VL,5,"My husband uses these, and he loves them. The sound quality is good, and set up was easy. Great translation too."
R3RMV6V3C2WG8E,3,"I bought these so I could play games, watch TV/Movies while others were sleeping or reading. They are comfortable, work well enough, and the sound is pretty good. Two downsides, the reception for the signal is easily distorted by interfering channels and it is very sensitive to the input volume to pick up the input devices signal.<br /><br />I use the headphones to receive input from a stereo receiver unit and if the volume from the stereo wasn't loud enough the signal wouldn't transfer to the headphones. Make sure you have the volume loud enough for the signal to send through to the headphones and adjust the volume on the headphones to fine tune."
R18LNIJG60PDOI,5,"I love to use the earphones when I watch American Idol or watch a movie where the music is louder than the speaking and I can't make out every word that the actors say.  My husband has better hearing than me, so when I use the earphones I'm not constantly turning the sound up and down.  If I need more sound I just turn up the volume on the the earphones.  The sound is like hearing in HD;  there's more vibrant sound and I can hear background music I never noticed before.  The earphone volume is about as low as it will go and I still hear everything.  It is a great product.  Someone recommended the earphones to me and I am so glad I bought them.  They are worth the money which was not that much.  They are easy to hook up; everything you need is in the box.  You can even go in another room or upstairs and still hear the TV."
R1HZ478KIIS5X8,4,We like this headset for its vastly superior clarity and range.  We only wish it had ear cups instead of ear pads so it would stay on more easily.
R3DVWQ8LWHRQ00,3,"I had a similar product the same brand for 6 years plus. This new one does not fit around my ears well, it easily falls off, it does not tune in as well.  I am thinking of returning and trying a different model. It is hard to try different models when buying on the Internet."
R32JU079E9JAG0,5,Wish I would have gotten this sooner. Its nice to have even if you don't have hearing issue. Amazing sound quality for FM type device.
RRITMJ560VGH8,2,The manufacturer informed me the transmitter will automatically stop transmitting when the audio source is silent.  Static is produced when the transmitter stops transmitting.
R3GXZNWJV9CNDT,5,I can sleep and my husband can watch TV-perfect! The sound is crisp and clean and the headset is very comfortable.
R1Z1XGARCDP0J,5,"After my Sony Headset went south, I needed a new set and decided on the Senheiser RS 120. IT was affordable and I liked the idea of having the RF instead of line of sight. I have been pleasently surprised with the performance and sound these deliver. When hooked to my stereo, I can go into the back yard and listen with no interference and good clarity of sound. The only downside I have is they do not fit tight enough on my head so when I bend over they have a tendency to slip off my head. I would recomend these to anyone."
R1FJRBZEQMS9YJ,5,"I love these wireless headphones.  I can go to the next room and not miss what is going  on.  I can continue doing the laundry , cooking and still enjoy the program.  The best thing of all, is not disturbing anyone else in the house.  I highly recommend these headphones with charging  unit."
R3NVGEHTDKGTFG,5,I'm very happy with the headphones the're a lot better than the last set I had.  I am also surprised with the clarity.
R1BFH3R9YSG25B,5,"Easy charging cradle. I bought a Sony pair, that played a fraction of a second later than my Samsung tv, so I got an echo when watching with my wife. These are perfect even though they are&#34;open&#34;, no echo.  Great life from easily serviceable aaa batteries."
R3GY1HDIW38Y4G,3,"The setup is not easy and the setup guide is poor. Sound is okay. Earphones are not comfortable, and wearing glasses makes it much worse. The volume and focus controls could have been much better placed. This is an okay device for first timers, but it is a lesson learned— you get what you pay for."
R34ST1UIUY385K,5,"After trying several other products, I was skeptical about these despite the Sennheiser brand name. I needn't have worried though as these headphones have excellent range and battery life. I really wanted a base station that both myself and my wife could use at the same time to listen to TV in bed while the kid is asleep. I didn't find much information on whether or not this base unit supported multiple headphones but I went ahead and bought &#34;Sennheiser HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System&#34; as well. This supplemental headset worked immediately with no setup and both headsets work simultaneously just fine. The sound quality is good but not excellent - for TV however they are more than adequate."
R3VINZIAA799G2,4,"great sound, both highs and lows, but somewhat subject to interference from other rf devices, and easily falls from head as others have said...I'm planning to make some sort of tether to prevent disaster, but haven't quite figured it out yet."
R32QRV2XTUV4N8,5,"Does exactly what the promotions say it will do - enable me to hear lower register sounds without blasting out my wife and daughter. Does get a bit irritating on my ears after a couple of hours, but that small discomfort is worth being able to hear without turning the volume up to full."
RO6OGC2NUBECG,5,"Especially if you have hearing loss, this is a wonderful device for all of your electronic audio devices in your home. You can now hear your TV and your Stereo."
R138C83HGS05TP,5,The earphones do exactly what I wanted.  I can hear my TV now  without interfering with anyone else.  They are comfortable to wear and stay charged with the charger.  Much better than the old ones that I had to continuously buy batteries.<br />I would recommend this product to my friends.
R2110O20TYQTVV,5,"Great sound,light wt.,and comfortable. I wear a hearing aid and these are the best headphones I have ever found. These headphones would be hard to beat for the price."
RQNTPTRUGFJ45,5,"We needed a solution to watching TV with my mom, who is hard of hearing.  Before we purchased these Headphones, we had to turn up the TV volume so high, it was uncomfortable for us.  Now we can enjoy TV without being blasted out of the house!"
R157POCWUZCC4V,5,"Out of the box all of the connections are there to connect the headphones to a TV or stereo.  The headphones use RCA jacks, but they also have a mini jack and a quarter inch jack adapter in the box.  Installation is simple and the rechargeable batteries are easy to replace when they reach the end of their life.<br /><br />This system replaces. Set of TV Ears and an RCA headset.  The sound quality and workmanship is far superior to those systems.  What really sets them apart though is the comfort.  No fatigue after hours of use."
R1ZCKJ5GGDEIAW,5,"My husband is hard of hearing, but thinks we're all crazy and he can hear fine - NOT TRUE. So, when he wakes up at night and can't sleep or gets up really early and the rest of the house is trying to sleep, he can turn on the TV, put on his headphones and listen to it at whatever sound level he needs without disturbing the rest of us. He has actually started putting on the music station on the TV and wearing them when he goes to bed to put him to sleep without disturbing others - ME! The only thing I wish is that he could wear them when we watch TV together and I could still hear the sound. Then he could listen to them at his loud level, while I could adjust the volumn to my level. If anyone knows of headphones like that, let me know!"
R2T3QGUCFGMPUU,5,"Exceeds my expectations. Perfect for watching movies, tv shows and sports because it dampens ambient noise and allows me to hear more clearly. I watch what I want without bothering anyone else."
R215ISDYQ7CF5P,5,very satisfied will recommend to friends.very usefull with noisy kids around while watching tv programs also good for hard hearing people
R3LU1TSFIEK65E,3,I bought this for my husband who is very hard of hearing.  It is a replacement for the RS 140 which they do not carry anymore.<br />In fact the 140 still worked ok but the earphones were broken and would not stay on his head. I tried to buy replacement headphones and also were not available.<br />I think they do this on purpose so as to make you buy a whole new set.<br />The others they had were too expensive for me so I got these.  He wears them but says they aren't as clear and have a lot of background noise when he turns the volume up where he can hear.
R1Z7OU50VZPS2B,5,"Wireless Headphone set for my 43'' Plasma, works perfect no negative hearing lost<br /><br />The head phones charge without no plugin, the rechargeble batteries in inside the left side of the headphone.<br /><br />Truely recommend."
R157O8PD245D6T,3,"working. It's good. The problem with the configuration. At this price you can buy other headphones with a constant frequency, which does not have to constantly adjust. If there are other wires, then noises appear."
R3HR94DGC5OWMF,3,"Easy to get static blast if volume to base unit too low.<br />Has been working well for several years, maybe new version better.."
R3JZP21WZBEZRN,5,got these because I am hard of hearing and I had to keep the volume so high and with these I don't disturb anyone else
RRE6MJQ9E2WJH,5,These are the best headphones we've used so far. We purchased 2 pairs and are very happy.<br />They're comfortable and the sound it great.
R281IE5TI1YX7C,5,"These headphones are a little bulky but I love being wireless. They are very comfortable, have great audio quality and great battery life. Excellent value for the money"
R9CY5V6CHJVHZ,2,"The product description stated that these headphones are comfortable.  Many reviewers agreed, but these headphones did not fit my head at all.  I don't even have a very small head.  I would say it is average.  These headphones would most likely fall off often.  I didn't bother setting up the whole system, so I can't speak to how well they work.  Many of the positive reviews are outdated.  There is much better technology out there now.  I chose to return these and look into other solutions."
RW2ZMCRDPP5JL,5,"I don't hear as well as I used to.  If I'm going to hear what's on the tv I need to turn the volume up.  This often makes the volume too loud for others in the room.  These headphones eliminate that issue.  I used to use wired headphones.  The wire was cumbersome, messy, and a hassle.  The sound quality of these headphones is outstanding.  The clarity is excellent.  They're comfortable.  I can leave the room for a while and not miss word.  Recharging couldn't be easier.  I completely recommend these.  I'm buying my father a set."
R388OSZCFGGSOJ,5,Bought these for my dad who was tired of not being able to hear the tv over his grandkids and loud mouthed daughter-n-law (brother's family not mine). He loved them and they work and sound great. Definitely brought peace back into that household!
R29MH2FFWAH7VY,4,"I was looking for an independent sound channel for the TV--my hearing is slightly impaired and my wife's hearing is excellent.  These headphones fix the problem completely.<br />Our TV has only one audio-out, and that is an optical port, which we use for the ZVOX sound box my wife loves.  Luckily, the cable box has another audio-out port that I use for the Sennheiser headphones.  This gives a completely independent sound channel.  The TV and the ZVOX can both be muted and I can still listen through the headphones.<br />The headphones are radio, not optical, so I can go to the kitchen, bathroom, even the basement., and still hear the TV.  That is a huge plus.  Most of the units advertised for hearing problems are IR, which is line-of-sight, and just about useless unless you are paralyzed in the chair.<br />The only down areas are that they are just a little heavy (after a 2 hour movie), and there is no tension adjustment for the ear pressure.  But they are still more than OK for me."
R281KWMCODY5AN,4,This is my 2nd set the first ones lasted 3 + years. They would be more comfortable to wear if they had a better pad set up. I glued foam around outer edge to make a pocket for my ears. the sound is fine. I use them to watch tv and listen to music when my wife is sleeping.
R2BG44IAP6EQH9,5,"It opened a whole new world of voice and music for me, the headset is comfortable and easy to use. I like it"
R2Z5JU364O2W12,4,all its advertised to be.  I use it for late night TV viewing.  serves the purpose for which I purchased.
RFDK7KM26EZT2,5,I bought mine in November 2010..  I use it everyday.. since my wife does not like the TV  volume on High.. and I like the sound on the high side... This headphone has serve US well.  Love the quality and the Stereo reception.  Worked well all these years.. and the battery charge lasts for a long time..  I would estimate  more than 8 hours.<br />Very Happy with this product.
R15VRVC8L9Y4K0,5,"Has great distance before a hiss starts to invade the clear audio. Headphones always charge--at least the charge light stays on when they are in holder, They charge might actually stop at full charge--I do not know, 3 frequency channels available if one is picking up some noise, or another channel is being used nearby. No such problems for me, so no report on cross-talk between frequencies. Real good frequency response----audio quality quite good. 2 aaa batteries easily pop under one earphone cover, and last forever, being rechargeable. A bit difficult to keep on head when bending over. Very slight pressure against my ears allows them to slide off, but if they had tight pressure, you'd surely get a headache. Have these on for hours sometimes and no discomfort. Use for a computer internet radio station, online storage music site, tv stereo audio--as other people in house use headphones, too, so anyone without them, have silence. Only use headband over top of head, as behind head, they'd slip right off. Green light shows when audio is present. Volume control on one ear. Also control to tune in audio for selected frequency. Another switch is on/off. Directions tell how to reset audio if lost. Unplug unit. Uninstall batteries then reinstall.  Hardly happens, though.  headphone AUDIO stops, get a hiss, so turn them off ! Hiss not heard at all when audio is present. Music and voice sound normal-------for sure, not tinny. No need to go sennheiser digital, though--since you'll also lose some wireless distance. Signal goes through walls, easily--never thought wireless could be so good.  Perhaps adding a personal chin strap to earphones on both sides, could keep them on when bending.  Headband very sturdy throughout. Sennheiser is QUALITY. UPDATE=UPDATE=UPDATE = I WAS ASKED ABOUT volts AND adapter--Must use 2 1.5 volt AAA battery rechargables in earpiece--long lasting. Input cord end from headphone cradle that plugs into output source is stereo RCA plugs that go to an adapterthat goes to 3.5 mm (1/8\\"") plug, that CAN then go to included adapter for phono plug if needed."
R3L9DNJOAONV37,5,"Having used a considerably lower cost product for years I was delighted with the quality of sound, the comfort, the adjustable features, and the ease of use.  A feature I particularly liked: I can still hear the sound when I walk into rooms other than that holding my sound system.  Plus the savings from buying it &#34;Used&#34; and finding it like &#34;New&#34;."
R25EFRS2WP45ZM,5,Great reception great sound.  This is perfect for me (and my wife) for me to listen to TV after she has gone to bed.  I love the recharging feature and the comfortable fit.  Easy to tune and plenty of volume headroom for a good dynamic range.  Highly recommended.
R1MW4P9G06JY7,1,Wouldn't recommend this. The on ear kept slipping off ear. Lots of static. I will opt for around ear and a wire next time.
R6CE6RMU1TFS,3,"This lower cost item is working for me.  I have the transmitter attached to the analog audio out of my flat screen TV.  I have no 'sound system' attached to the overall setup, so all sound comes through the TV speakers.  What this allows me to do is to have both the sound come out of the TV speakers, and be simultaneously listening through the headphones.  That way, I can get the headphones on my wife who has some trouble hearing clearly, while I listen to the TV speakers.  It works just fine, the 3-star rating is for lots of little things.  The over-ear headphones are slightly unstable on the head - if you bend your head forward, they tend to move.  The Transmitter/receiver pair requires that you &#34;tune&#34; the sound from the transmitter as it enters the headphones, using an adjustment wheel on the headphone.  Pain in the rear.  And the wheel is located RIGHT below the volume control wheel, meaning it's easy to bungle as you try to adjust the volume while it's on your head.<br />Distance is not a problem (25 feet seems OK, even through walls), the sound quality is good enough for TV, better than the TV speakers.<br />Also ordered HDR120, which is the headphones-only, and they work just fine with the RS120 transmitter.<br />Overall quality is adequate on all the parts.<br />I think they're a bit pricey, but they do work as advertised, and are working for me in the way I desire."
R914GR9B4I9QH,4,"Design<br />  Overall, the design of this product is OK. These headphones are a little wide, so they may look funny when you wear them. However, the black design is very nice and the padding is comfortable. After while you may forget you are even wearing them. On the back side of the headphones, there are two dials for volume and tuning as well as an on/off switch. The package comes with a recharge station which is pretty simple to install. The entire set looks very appealing sitting on my desk.<br /><br />Sound<br />  Overall, the sound is nearly perfect in quality. However, I am no audiophile so take that statement with a grain of salt. I would give the sound a solid 8/10. I took points off because of the faint white noise in the background when nothing is playing. Also, after a few minute of being idle, these headphones will send a loud white noise through the speakers. Other than that they work perfectly in any part of my house.<br /><br />Cost<br />  It's not free.<br /><br />4/5"
R3KFHYHNWJ5QXI,3,"I received the product in the expected time, but it was not in the original package. It was also lacking the instruction sheet and a adapter jack. I was refunded $20 from the supplier for the packaging problem. I've been using the product and like it's performance. Last night it wasn't working. I never checked the batteries used, alkaline, that were in the headset. The instruction sheet and inside the headset tells you not to use alkaline batteries, only rechargeable AA batteries. When I opened the headset, one battery had leaked onto the terminal connection and corroded it. I cleaned the terminal and installed the proper rechargeable batteries.  Please delete my first survey about the supplier, EZCORP, as I will not use them again after they wrote me that they check every product that leaves the warehouse. I will continue to shop at Amazon."
R16SHU3Z1627CI,5,I really like it! Is my second for the other TV! But just took it on a cruise ship so i could hear the ship TV and a cover for ear pc came off and was lost. Can you help me? Please Carol O'Brien
R1U0A62BAPXUH6,4,"The headphones functioned well. There was some adjustment to minimize static and the charging cradle contact requires a delicate touch. That said, it allows me to watch a little TV in bed without disturbing my wife."
R1I2N0N58Q5NMP,5,"I was searching for wireless headphones, but didnt want to spend too much money. I searched Amazon , and realized that a lot of people liked the Sennheiser brand. I considered the RS-110 , but in the end , for a few dollars more , i chose the RS-120. The rechargeable battery option seemed like a no hassle easy upgrade.<br />The item was delivered promptly and packed extremely well by Amazon. After i opened it, assembly was quick and easy. The only issue i had was the lack of instructions to set up the headphones with my tv. I have an LG LED flatscreen. I admit, trying to understand where to plug the AV wires (Red & White)  on the tv was frustrating, because i tried multiple combinations , and just couldnt get audio from them. In the end i just plugged  the headphone attachement to the headphone outlet on the tv, and finally got it to work.<br />Now that its working , i love the headphones , and get to watch tv without disturbing my wife and vice versa."
RB12LZAN9N6U,1,"Opened the box, plugged the unit in and it powered up for about 30 seconds, then it powered off while still plugged in.  No power, no work.  This was to be a replacement for the same model purchased in 2009 that also lost its ability to power the base.  I would question the wisdom in buying another unit like this."
RJBB1L5R9W1IA,5,"My daughter is hard-of-hearing, so she sits across the room with me with the headphones on. She can hear the TV perfectly, as she can adjust the volume to suit her needs. I have listened to TV with them on myself, and the reception and sound quality are excellent. I fit them back behind a 50 inch diagonal plasma TV, which is on a stand on top of a TV stand. No part of the headphone charger or the phones themselves can be seen from the front of the TV. So, there is no need to sit them in front of the plasma TV and block any of the picture or the remote control receiving spots.<br /><br />They have been used for a couple of months and I have yet to change the batteries. The signal reception continues throughout this 4 bedroom house, the carport, and porch.<br /><br />I chose Sennheiser because they have a reputation for unparalleled quality, and have found out personally that the reputation is such for good reason. Buy these !"
RPK873E0L9ZZV,1,"Connected as instructed, loud background noise, in many head positions and places of my rooms. If I did not move my head, there were positions when it worked very well. Tried several TVs, in  bedroom and basement.<br />Completely useless for exercise. Moves all over my head.<br />I was not lucky with this one, returned same day.<br />PG"
R1761QLS4IMYU8,5,Husband Love this headset much more than his older one!!  He can wander thru the house & it receives perfectly!  Thanks!
R3KKPQW2VUNHVL,5,The Headphones are exactly what I need in order to hear a small television in my kitchen. It was so good I got another one for a friend of mine. Both of us are hard of hearing and the headphones solved our problem
RYW9YGSCKJ2NJ,5,Bought these to replace an old pair for 82 year old (hearing impaired) grandmother. She loves them! Very clear sound.
RO89643VUR4QH,4,I actually bought this headset for a friend since I like mine so much.  Highly recommend these for watching TV or listening to music
R27U5XPUZRU0EU,5,Great product. Sound is perfect. Use them when I want to watch tv when it has to be quiet around the house.
R10E60E23DLFRP,5,"A product which preserves marriages. Your spouse can watch the tube while you sleep. I've been impressed with the build quality, durability -- we've had it a couple of years and it is going strong -- and the sound quality. It is far better than the supplementary speakers we use with our home entertainment system."
R12EK18IMJAPVV,5,"I enjoy listening to the radio but my day is often chopped in chunks, sometimes I am near a radio, sometimes I am not. It was always frustrating to be listening to a show and miss parts. Now I can wander about and miss nothing. I have been over 100' from the base and can still hear the show. And while these aren't noise cancelling headphones, I can use some of my shop tools and still hear the broadcast."
R399ACYRB2DIKB,2,"The frequency range is incredible and comparable to Bose in performance but this headphone has some problems. First is the<br />not over the ear design has a tendency to slip when your moving, Quite annoying when you're on a treadmill. Second is the Noise or some call it Static. The design did not give enough shielding or filter for electronic noise to seep in when no signal is being received.<br />Much like the old CB or Ham radio. Newer electronics have an auto volume down or filters, this definitely doesn't have it. Lowering the volume will decrease the noise level but will degrade the performance since the transmitter has an auto volume control. I first check out whether it is sensitive to outside noise source like a florescent lamp ballast or close by transmitter (airport-aircraft) but this operate at a frequency above or below the 900 MHZ. No choice but to live with it, send it back or hack the circuit board."
R1399T8MJEPS5,5,I had another name brand pair that just would not give a clean sound. Got rid of those and ordered these. They are clean and give good sound reproduction.
R2LHOQTK6WC24X,5,"The first unit was defective, After returning it a new unit arrived sooner than I expected. This unit works really well, I can finally understand what they are saying.<br />Yes I would refer to a friend"
R3N8U1CKE3IUT6,5,"These headphones work great though my entire apartment. They are not bluetooth, but the simple connection and wireless works great."
R2MSHAA4UTIFX1,4,"This was a must product when i purchased it, I use to like in a small apartment and didnt wanted to wake my GF while watching tv (late night).<br /><br />So this product was a savior, and simple to use too.<br /><br />But only problem is a constant hiss sound when thr are no dialogues. I am use to it, but i am not expecting that everybody will be, so that's why 4* and not 5*."
R354WQIWOS1DUG,5,"I have several flat screen TV's in my home, and none of them produce sound that is acceptable.  Two of them are in locations that make it impossible to install typical receivers and speaker systems, and we also have issues with someone trying watch tv in the family room while conversations are ongoing in other rooms that make listening difficult.  These headphones have great sound, and amazing range.  Want to walk into the kitchen and make a snack while watching the move, the sound goes with you.  I was so impressed that I bought a second pair for another room.  With the 3-position transmitter switch, the headphones can both be used on different programs in different rooms without interference.  Or can be switched to the same frequency so two people can watch the same show without disturbing others.  And the on-ear design makes it easy to still have a conversation while wearing them.  I bought a pair of these for my father, who is very hard of hearing,  several years ago, and he uses them whenever he watches tv.  All in all, another great Sennheiser product.  NOTE!  If you tv only has digital audio outs (which more and more do these days) get a digital/analog converter (DAC) such as ViewHD Optical SPDIF/Coaxial Digital to RCA L/R Analog Audio Converter also available on Amazon.  Simple little box that can be used several different ways."
R1EFZO2AN4HHBW,5,"I have been wearing these at work for over a month.  Coworkers tease me because I look like an air traffice controller.  They may look silly, but they sound is excellent.  Easy access to the volume and on/off switch is helpful.  Huge range - I  can walk about 250 feet inside my office before the music starts to break up.  So easy to set-up and I love the hanging charge design.  Only downer is the initial 24 hour charge when you get them.  But over all for the price, the quality is excellent."
REVVVGNFG9DQL,5,Perfect product for my 97 y.o. mother.  She can actually hear the tv now with all the backrounds sounds that accompany a program.  I might remain in the will now  :0)
RJ0XG12U0T8ZA,2,"These things just aren't that great.  The tuning wheel does not have enough adjustability to get the best reception.  Even with the transmitter base literally right next to me, the sweet spot on the tuning dial is only one mm worth of dial travel.  It's really hard to find that best reception spot as a result.<br /><br />I would advise against these if you could go with a corded model."
RJ5X13O8WZ0HE,1,"On-the-ear headphones is a concept I never experienced before these headphones, and after briefly trying them, hope to never experience again.  They were uncomfortable and constantly felt as if they were about to fall off, especially when attempting to wear them while my head was resting against a pillow.<br /><br />Also, the tuning mechanism on these headphones is horrible.  I found myself constantly trying to tune them to the ideal spot, and then losing it when accidentally brushing my shoulder against them, or when shifting my sitting position.<br /><br />I now own a pair of Sony headphones that are over-the-ear and autotuning.  The difference between them is night and day, and the cost difference is only about $20.  That's certainly worth it to me."
R1RHP3VH6LPZP9,4,"I noticed the buzzing people were talking about, but only when the input volume was low and I had to jack up the headphones volume. Otherwise, the quality has been perfect. I don't use them for more than 10ft. It is a little light on the bass, but I don't mind for the price.<br /><br />The major only downside is that they hurt my ears when worn for extended periods of time. I guess I just have ears that stick out too much because most people say they are extremely comfortable."
R2427RO36LWJJG,1,Made batteries burn out and leak substance 3 times in one year and now not functioning. Contacted company for service. To be continued
R20HOYY150AKBA,3,I love the way they charge on the stand. connection is easy and they feel comfortable to wear. But there is a hiss in the background. I'm not sure if all cordless headphones do this or if it's a problem with my system. It would be great if I could talk to someone about it. But I bought them on the internet instead of going to a local store.
R1SN38LJ7TXF9P,5,I have bought a few of these headphones for myself and for a few seniors that are having trouble hearing the tv. The wireless headphones are really wonderful to walk around with and still hear the dialogue. The seniors and those watching tv with them are enjoying the shared experience without getting blasted by the high volume of the tv. Easy to set up and comfortable to wear.
R3COI4VQL71TS1,4,"Works great, hooks up easily. Great for use with hearing aids to prevent too loud TV.<br /><br />Nice stand<br />Hang on stand to charge<br />On/off on the headset"
R2F7MAY0PAQGIT,5,"I bought these for my father who is hard of hearing from working in a manufacturing shop for 30 years, so he's the guy who has to have the TV blaring. Then my mom gets pissed because she has to talk over the TV. And then the commercials are even louder! I hooked these babies up...problems solved. If something is on the TV dad cares about hearing he grabs his headphones, mom gets to listen at a normal volume,and they don't have to talk to each other. All joking aside, he really like these things so much so that I ended up getting a switch box so I could hook up the TV and the DVD player, and you could switch between the two with a press of a button. So now dad can watch his action movies at night too while mom is sleeping."
R105R5OYYV2RF8,4,bought these as a gift and she really liked them. Sennheiser hasn't really let me down besides with those cx800 or whatever they're called.
R3AWQV75Q23FNM,5,"great headphones, great price and the sound is super clear ,  never ecstatic interferences  even if you move a lot during their use, great buy"
R18TOV2435FLU7,5,"Some of the reviews made me skeptical.Using,answered the question....great product,fulfilled all my needs.Not much to look at,but sure performs well.Let's not leave Amazon out,great service!Thanks"
R1UBNT0X8LEL9Q,4,Good quality sound at an affordable price. Easy tuning and volume control on ear piece. Good range. I can turn up the volume to suit my needs without disturbing anyone else. The TV volume can be set for others. Very happy with my purchase.
R3E74DAXK5GFGU,5,"They would be excellent except that there is a sharp, static tone occasionally and then they quit.  However, I may not have them tuned correctly.  The sound is loud, surprises you, and take a little bit to restore itself."
R2T24VC3Y5T4Y3,5,My use is a few episodes or a video game after my wife and kid go to bed.  I have never tried to wear more than an hour.  The Range and clarity are amazing.  I purchased after ordering a less expensive pair of IR/IF and would not even reach to the couch.  I am able to walk around the house with this set with no loss of connection.
R2SYBF319P0GB2,5,"Voice are nice and clear, range is very good. . . . . . . . . . . ."
R14CKFL0RP4LP8,2,"These headphones sound great, were pretty comfortable on my head, and I liked the look and ease of the charging station.  I also liked the price.<br /><br />What I really did not like was the deafening static that would kick in if the input was muted for 30 seconds or so.  I used them to stream music from my desk at work, and I often need to mute to speak with co-workers.  The sudden full volume static blast resulted in a few mid-sentence f-bombs being dropped, which gave the office a boost for the afternoon, but left my ears in pain.<br /><br />A little hiss in the background from broadcasting on the crowded 900Mhz is expected with most wireless headphones.  However, the auto-gain control freaking out because there is no input is an unacceptable design flaw.  Back to Amazon they go!"
R2DD5SMG2T4A30,5,"We purchased two sets of the headphones, had a glitch with one.  Amazon accepted the return and shipped out a new set immediately.  We are in our mid 60's with hearing issues and this purchase has made listening to TV, Netflix, Pandora a joy. Comfortable headsets and great sound.<br />Highly recommended purchase.  Thank you Amazon!"
R1FXRA23FIAEXD,5,"Having genetic hearing loss. My husband bought me these for Christmas and it was the first time in years that I could truly enjoy watching a movie. I shared my great find with my siblings and they bought them and raved to friends to the point that our local electronic store had to back order them. My husband whose hearing is fine wanted a pair as it was like listening to a movie in personal surround sound. He got his today for his birthday.NO Complaints with the ease of set up, sound quality, or anything else. A great big thank you Amazon for offering this amazing product."
R2VTHXANDOYNG5,4,"First of all let me start by saying I know very little about electronics and how to hook things up. After having these in the box for a couple of weeks and several unsuccessful attempts at installation a friend finally helped me out. He did manage to get them working. Keep in mind I have never used wireless ear phones before just top quality ear bubs. I use these in my 38' 5th wheel trailer. The flat screen HD TV is mounted on an adjustable base in a cabinet. It's hooked up to a Harmon Kardon surround system. The base for the ear phones is in the cabinet behind the TV which doesn't seen to interfere with it's reception.<br /><br />Here is my short review.<br /><br />THE PRO'S:  I have NO hiss whatsoever. The sound is clear. The mids and high range are very good. The charging unit is very easy to use and seems to be doing a great job. They are comfortable to wear and don't make my ears hot. My wife can sleep with no TV noise coming from the living room. (BIG BONUS).<br /><br />THE CON'S: You do pick up back ground noise such as the portable heater fan working in the background. They fit loose and tend to come off easy. The piece of foam that sits on top of your head could be thicker and more comfortable. I don't find them all that light weight but I wouldn't consider them heavy either. In my opinion the base sound is week and could be stronger.<br /><br />MY QUESTION:<br /><br />The phones work fine except when I switch the TV to surround sound. Then the signal gets jumbled, the sound then becomes fractured. For a couple of seconds it's fantastic but then breaks up. If I take it off surround the phones are very clear but lack the depth of the surround sound. If these worked with my surround sound I would be over the moon. Any helpful comments on this would be welcomed."
R1ETZA3GQLIPC0,4,this is  fantastic<br /><br />i use it everyday<br />battery is good<br /><br />i use it up to 60 feet away<br />in the next room<br />i would  buy again
RI0CQ7I3RGCJ2,3,they make the movies and tv shows hearable.  my only complaint is getting the right frequency for both ears.  one side works great.  when i try to equalize the sound the other side fades.
R3AI8DJWX674X7,1,The power cord supplied with the unit doesn't work.  This is my second pair and when I used the power cord from the first pair this set works fine but neither set works with the cord supplied with this purchase.
R3DP8HHPZ4WQ1J,4,Only problem is the headphones are so loose that if you bend your head forward or back even an inch or two they fall off. Otherwise very well made and very comfortable.
R36BPDQDH7XTO,5,"This is our 4th set in the house (we have one for each tv).  The original ones (after several years of use) were getting a bit difficult to tune in, so I ordered a new pair, and these are perfect.  Great if you want to watch tv while your spouse is sleeping."
RF0ELQO231XIM,5,"I allready had the older model, and this one is definately a step up. Being able to have a storage place that also charges? Just awesome. Thanks!"
R3V1LJ3JTZTRXA,1,"I have bought several pairs of Sennheiser wireless headphones and always been happy with them.  When my wife wanted to have a set but she thought we could save a little money and bought this lower-end version.  She paid the price.  Whenever we paused a show for a while, the headphones' signal would drop and the headphones emit a deafening static.  She had to remember to turn them off or take them off her head or get blasted.  Also, the headphones don't have much padding and thus don't feel as comfortable as the better Sennheiser models.  Don't buy these, spend the extra money to get the RS 160."
R3A4WHFEWFWGJL,5,"Great product, easy to use and set up.<br />The sound feels like you are right in the concert hall.<br />Does not wake sleeping people."
R34VIKHKXOV314,4,Excellent audio qualities. Headband should have a way to adjust tension on head since every time I lean forward they have a tendency to fall off. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to hear TV without bothering anyone else. My wife liked them so much she wants her own pair.
R2K950OLZLGTO9,5,"This has met and exceeded my expectations. As an insomniac with hearing loss, I have used several headphones at might while watching TV. None have come close to the comfort and the sound quality of these. Other reviewers have commented about some &#34;noise&#34;, etc. I have encountered none of this, just pure, clean, dynamic sound reproduction. Perhaps others have inadvertently moved the tuning dial slightly off channel."
R3HEGBSVGP72JN,4,"In general, the headphones accomplish their stated purpose. Unfortunately, like most wireless headphones, they suffer from minor static, even when close in proximity to the transmitter. Also, the part which goes over the ear is overly large and gets uncomfortable after extended use."
R11J8OBU9CHTE6,5,"Bought two headsets with chargers...one for my wife and one for me...I hooked up one to the televison and have my wife's headset charging on that charger...have another charger with my headset charging, and we listen to the TV with both headsets...much better than TV Ears...the batteries are two AAA rechargable in each headset, and when they die, can be replacaed with new rechargable AAA batteries...we like them very much...the stero sound is wonderful...you can hear sounds to the right and left of the TV screen...we would recommend them highly...."
RC987F3DGJQP9,5,"For the price they're awesome. They're loud and pretty clear and can go, apparently, very far. I wouldn't know because we live in a condo and I never bothered wearing them while walking to the laundry room. They're reasonably comfortable. Your ears won't over heat BUT keep them on for more than a couple of ours and the tension of the headphones on your ears will make your cartilage begin to feel sore. They sit on TOP of your ears, they do not cup them. Base is on all of the time which is great. Easy convenience. I've tried them in 2 different condos and both times they behaved them same. Now, I WILL NOT give them a lower score because of the &#34;hiss&#34; and &#34;pops&#34; you hear with these things. It's the nature of the beast. They use FM Modulation. I'm surprised they actually sound as good as they do using this technology. So going into it I knew I would have some trouble with them but it actually wasn't bad at all. Not noticeable UNLESS you're sitting in a very quite part of a movie or show OR if your head is in a certain position that they don't like. It can get quite annoying and almost not tolerable. But again, if this bothers you move up to the next model that uses 2.4Ghz Kleer Technology. If you need something cheap that can go a long distance these are your best bet."
R1PW7ZBT13LNHW,1,"I thought by ordering Sennheiser, a German manufacturer, I would be getting a quality product. What a disappointment.<br />The headphones do not sit on the cradle properly. You have to put a book on top of them to hold them down so they make contact.<br />The tone switch has to be positioned perfectly so that you can hear out of both sides. Usually I can hear only out of one side.<br />There is a crackling noise every minute or two coming from each side. Maybe the set that i have is just a LEMON!"
R2APBR3RKLWWF7,2,"I purchased this item after testing one at a friends house - worked great.  I ordered the unit through Amazon.<br />when the unit arrived - it would not charge properly.  The 110V charger did not seat into the unit.  I sent<br />a e-mail, through Sennheiser's contact address to seek advice, etc.  i waited for a response for one week,<br />never heard from them.  As a result, I returned the unit to Amazon.  Excellent response from  Amazon re refund,etc.<br /><br />However, due to the lack of customer service from Sennheiser would not purchase from them again!!!!"
R28AXVJA7JTKZR,5,"I tried a variety of solutions to listen to TV without disturbing others.<br />These headphones are comfortable, have quality audio, and have been fully reliable for the last 3 months.<br />Wireless with reception several rooms away from the TV.<br />A great product for my needs"
RD45HJIVK8S3U,5,"All you have to do is hang the earphones on the charger, and it will charge automatically. It's Brilliant! I recommend it to anyone who would like to listen to TV without disturbing others. You should consider buying a second headset for when you have company, but not everyone wants to hear the TV."
R12MDWFMY6TG81,5,"I bought these headphones over three years ago. They are nearly perfect and still working great. I wanted wireless headphones so that I could move anywhere in the house or yard while listening to music, internet radio, sports, and books on tape without disturbing the rest of the family.<br />Their range is amazing - I've driven up the street with them and they don't lose reception completely until about one block away.<br />Their battery power is great - I can listen to them all day long without having to recharge them.<br />Most of the time there is no static. When there is static from interference, it is not bad at all. But clarity is not that important for me - I'm listening to football and Sabbath, not Mozart.<br />As for comfort, I can wear them for about an hour and then they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears, but I just put them around my neck and turn up the volume. They will not stay on my head when I bend over, but again I just put them around my neck when necessary.<br />About a year ago, the cradle stopped working, so I unplugged it, let it sit for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and it has been working fine since then."
R13K3QR1TBPHZM,2,For something I spent $80+ on I expected a better sound quality as well as not having to deal with the constant static noise in the background. Terribly disappointed.
RUX5MV8O55463,4,"Good reception. clear, and can go around in the house and the reception do not break. this is easy to set up and easy to use . this have a good backup.<br /><br />Only one issue with this is the tuning button on the headset. I confuse it with Volume contorl multiple time, then I have to retune."
R2IR8URTLD70QS,2,I bought this as Christmas gift and the quality is less than what I expected.  It  has static and you have to keep on adjusting the tuning to get reception which is still not good.  I was very disappointed because I have the 140 Sennheiser wireless which is excellent.
R1B4DT6V3KPPAX,5,"I literally wore out my Sennheiser RS110 wireless headphones. I thought I would simply replace them, but then I saw that the 120s have a recharging cradle, too. The sound is a bit better, the headset is more comfortable,  and a recharging cradle besides.<br />My wife is a school teacher, so \\""quiet time\\"" during her grading time is a must. These headphones have such great fidelity that I hardly miss the home theater speakers for normal listening.<br />Excellent range--more than 200 feet in our neighborhood."
RL0GRWQ4MZKNX,5,"Great product. Amazed at its low cost. Much cheaper than alimony in a household where, prior to delivery, a nightly admonition was &#34;Can you pleeeeze turn that TV down!&#34;"
R3NR2BVDFJM9TT,5,"I got these cuz I'm a night owl, hard of hearing, and didn't want to disturb my partner while I'm watching tv. Set up was easy after reading the instructions. The sound is amazing. I even use them during the day when I want a great listening experience. Love them so much my partner bought just the headphones and we alternate using the charging dock that came with my pair. Love love love!!!"
R3IIQENV42X5KW,5,"Here's My Review Of Those Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Head Phones ; I Bought To Use In The Bed Room With Both The TV & The Roku 2 XS  :  On A Scale Of 1-10 , I Give Them A 9.5 !!  Sound Is Great, No Drop Outs, & About A 200 Foot Range !!  Very Cool !!!"
R38RA7NIG03B1D,2,"I would give these headphone a better rating if it were based solely on the sound quality and function, which is adequate.  The issue is the lack of tension to keep the headphones positioned during use.  A tilt of the head downward causes the phones to slip forward.  There is no way to adjust the phones for more tension.  I would not recommend these based on the inconvenience of having to constantly reseat them.  There is simply not enough tension available for an on-the-ear type set like this."
R28YRIKVCK2Z11,5,"I bought this unit and two additional headsets from Amazon in 2009. They units have been in use since then and continue to work well. We use them in our home gym to provide TV sound while exercising.<br /><br />The sound is superior to TV speakers. Without them, there is a tendency to increase TV volume when more than one person is exercising, which results in a noisier environment and makes casual talking more difficult. The louder a TV is played the poorer the sound quality is going to be. These headphones eliminate all these issues. Volume is individually controlled, its easier to understand the TV and comments from others and the lower noise level is a plus for everyone involved.<br /><br />There has never been a problem with battery life that we've encountered. We have added small number labels to keep track of which one we are using and each person puts his on the charger after use. There is no formal program in place, just an effort to get them all a turn on the charger. Usage and charging can be sporadic but we have yet to have a battery problem.<br /><br />The only maintenance we do is to occasionally remove the pads and rinse them under the faucet. After rinsing, press them together to squeeze out most of the water and leave them to dry for the next session. We don't scrub or rub these as they are a thin open celled foam and probably would not respond well to rough or aggressive treatment. The frequency of cleaning would depend on your on preference. The pads are really easy to remove and to reattach.<br /><br />The headphones tend to move or slip when doing exercises where your arms may contact them or where the the head moves a lot or changes orientation. Examples of this are some aerobic dancing moves or reclining on a bench to lift weights. They are best suited for things like treadmill, elliptical and stationary bike. To me those are the most boring and where I need them the most.<br /><br />These are well made, good quality units. They are dependableand easy to use. In my opinion they provide good value for the money spent."
RDYFQHOUZCXUS,5,I needed to replace a pair of Sony headphones that half the time would not turn on.  I also like the RF signal instead of the Sony's IR which cuts out when you move out of line-of-sight.  Great upgrade !!
R1AM7XRZJVR0Y4,4,"I bought these for someone else.  They said that they like these Sennheiser RS120 headphones, therefore I am happy with them."
R1O4OKXUT0QGA3,3,"I bought this to practice playing bass without inflicting the experience on my neighbors. I admit to having multiple wireless electronics in the area that could be influencing the lack of clean sound. It may not be the product's fault at all. I've tried all the channels and fine tuning the frequencies, with no luck. I eventually get past the high squeal, because once the backing track is playing and I'm playing bass to the backing track, the squeal is negligible. You may have a better environment. It has been robust with no problems, charges fully on the dock and has a great sound.Comfortable ear pads and quality construction."
R186ELMHZJPZR4,5,I've had these headphones for over four years. I honestly think that they are one of the best products I've ever bought from amazon.com. I use them daily to watch movies when the wife is asleep. I would buy them again without hesitation.
R14MFMIPL99ODG,5,"Good sound quality, easy and reliable to use. Battery charge lasts a long time. Easy connectivity and convenient to use."
R3DZXNL9H51FWH,2,The headphones work but there are many issues. The main one being the annoying background noise and the the even more annoying noise that starts if the headphones are not used for a while. Would not recommend this product.
R3P11W7Z3B0428,2,"I decided to order these headphones because the reviews seemed mostly positive. I was disappointed in the quality right off the bat. The charger plug on the base unit barely fits. There is little room on the bottom access panel to get the yellow plug into its opening. The quality of sound is poor. After fooling with the setting to get the clearest sound it still wasn't great. Changing channels on the base unit made no difference. Then later in the day I tried using the head phones and got the sound of a totally different channel??? Later at night I was able to use the head phones again but 10 minutes into the show the reception changed to a LOUDER and different TV show? I emailed Scnnheiser and they surmised I was picking up a signal from another house in my neighborhood. I could hear their TV but not my own, I changed channels and tried fine tuning but nothing worked. I will try to return this and consider a IRF type. :("
R19LVTZ9KHF4NQ,4,Reliability and sound quality is really good and it is comfortable to wear while sitting around in the evening watching tv.
R1VCAPTW5F07K6,2,"i bought these headphones based on the great reviews i read on them.  the first time i put them on my ears, they sounded amazing.  when i let my husband wear them while he watched the walking dead, i too had to hear the stinking show.  i don't know if i'm doing something wrong, but i can hear the audio when they're on his ears. like there are speakers outside the inner ear pieces.<br />perhaps i am over analyzing this product, but aren't headphones supposed to alleviate this issue?  i should hear nothing when i sit by his side and read, or when i'm sleeping, i shouldn't hear anything right?  or maybe they're not what i expected.  i have no idea.  i'm just frustrated."
R3DN1BFT0SY6UA,1,"I was admittedly spoiled by the more comfortable (and expensive) wired headsets, but this felt like wearing bricks on my ears.  That was tolerable, and I could even put up with the difficulty I had tuning it, but then after less than a few hours use it simply stopped working.  Just like that I was unable to tune the headset into the station for the iphone it was connected to.  I spent half an hour trying to fix it then just tossed it back in the box and decided that putting up with a wire was a small price to pay for better sound quality, greater comfort, and reliability."
R3MSYGUUFBSZW8,4,These headphones work and sound really well for wireless headphones.  The only complaint I have is the noise that shows up sometimes.  It's not terrible noise but it's still annoying.  I definitely recommend these if you want wireless headphones. If not then go with wired.
RBT21CF42DJO9,5,"My husband is hard of hearing.  He usually has the TV so loud that I have to go into another room.  With these, the TV can be on mute and he can still hear it."
R34WOS7U820P63,5,"I have used cheaper (~$30-$40) RF wireless headphones in the past. They always were popping and littered with static, no matter what I did. Reposition the transmitter, turning off other wireless devices, input signal manipulation. Nothing worked.<br /><br />My wife and I got fed up, but were hesitant to spend 2 to 3 times the price on this set.<br /><br />This has been worth every penny I paid for it. No more static, no more popping. Setup was a snap, and the sound quality is fantastic (for RF wireless, anyway).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these.<br /><br />The one downside is that there is no battery life indicator. The headphones don't gradually get quieter when the batteries die. You get about 10 seconds where the volume goes down, then they just shut off."
RMB7BAM37ZLB2,5,"Bought these for my mom who lives in a nursing home. She doesn't want to disturb her roommate. Of course, I had to try them out before taking them to her. She almost didn't get them. Great quality, easy to recharge, comfortable. I love them and am looking at buying myself a pair for those late night movies and sporting events. Can have great sound and as loud as I want without disturbing the rest of the household!"
R1R87XSE2P09CM,2,"This is German engineering?<br />The power cord plugs into the base unit into  receptacle recessed into an unnecessarily small slot in the back. The slot is so smail that once the plug-in is in the slot, you can't get a grip on the plug-in, you have to push on the cord.  Unfortunately the plug-in does not fit well into the receptacle- the plug-in is a little too long and very snug. Since you have to push on the wire to get the plug-in into the slot, it is difficult to get the plug-in fully seated, and difficult to tell whether it is firmly seated. After 15 minutes of frustration, I managed to get the power light to come on.<br /><br /> This design deficiency is so stupid that I am amazed that a German company would acknowledge that they are responsible for it.. The plug should fit in the receptacle and the slot should be big enough for the user's fingers; or even better the receptacle should not be recessed so far that this becomes an issue.<br /><br />This is my third purchase of this model. The first two did not have this problem. Maybe they will go back to the old design. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Otherwise the product seems to be OK, Obviously I like it well enough to buy a third one.  But I have no plans to buy  another if I need a fourth."
R18W8U3EHAP6J4,3,"I have difficulty in hearing, so these headphones seemed the ideal solution to hearing the television without annoying other people in the house. For this they worked, but three months later, they failed.    The website [...] is not the easiest to navigate and the product support area is lacking in solutions, so I have to return the unit to them -- another pain.    If the headphones worked properly, although they are not as comfortable as others, I would gladly recommend them, but ...."
R3JU6OJAY39S3E,4,"Works very well.  I purchased a second one for a different room. We have used the first one for 3 years now.  Battery charges perfectly, sound is great."
R2JGN2ZJYOCFF0,5,"My husband got these for me when I was pregnant with our youngest kiddo so I would be able to watch/listen to TV or music as I nursed repeatedly in the middle of the night for those first brutal months. Over six years later, that kid prefers mac n cheese and long, sleepless nights are distant in my memory - but the headphones still work like new.<br /><br />They are the one piece of \\""baby\\"" equipment that still gets used. As a night owl, I can be up half the night watching whatever and not keep the rest of the house awake. Sound quality is rich and I have yet to blow it out - I wish my car's speakers were as good. They are also great for gaming, allowing for one of our kids to play while another tries to get homework done. Even on my son's kid-sized noggin, the headphones usually stay put as he jumps around. (That surprised me, because they are a bit on the heavy side, but not unusually so for wireless.)<br /><br />Installation was easy and straight-forward. I invested in some inexpensive splitters so I could plug them in to more than one source, with only slight degradation. (The small amount of occasional wireless hiss makes more difference than the split.)<br /><br />With most electronics having a life span of a couple of years anymore, I am fairly over the moon about these."
RDXJHPFV9AQRX,3,"Very easy to use because there are no wires, but the bass is not really 'there' and the volume wheel sounds scratchy when I turn it up or down and at low levels the right side drops out a bit."
R1TAJ93F3GN2GB,4,"Now first i'll give you the good news, the good news is the sound quaility is great , the headphones fit comfortably and the battery life is good. I seen some of the reviews complaining about the volume and tuning knobs being in an akward position on the headphones but i think their over reacting, the positioning of the knobs could of been done better but far from a deal breaker.<br />Now the bad news is if you wanna use this device for everything connected to your tv like i do (PS3, XBOX, Cable) then your gonna need to buy a digital audio analog audio converter because the audio wire that comes attached to the base is a typical analog (red and white audio cord) that will only work if you connect it to the audio out source. This may not be a problem for some but some newer tv's don't have an analog audio out and only a digital optical audio out like my new samsung smart tv.<br /><br />So when i first recieved these headphones they would only work through my cable box because the cable box was the only device that had an audio out. I was upset to find out the only way i could get the headphones to work for every device connected to my tv was to buy a digital audio/ analog audio converter that cost about 50 BUCKS! So other then that great device."

R3MZIEJ4WJB7QR,3,"Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging... little disappointed that the set up is not a simple as they imply.  Could not hook up direct to my $1500. TV.  Had to hook up to my $3000. surround sound system in the front, and it is not aesthetically pleasing that way.  Works &#34;OK&#34;  NOT as good as expected for being a Sennheiser.  Little bit too heavy sitting on the head, and FALLS OFF IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD A TINY BIT!"
R30IUKYAITP3M0,5,These headphones are great. I am very happy I purchased them and would highly recommend them. They are certainly excellent.
R1GVHRF9BKI961,5,"I wear hearing aids and like to  watch TV while exercising on the treadmill. I really like to watch Modern Marvels or<br />the Science channel but the combination of their stupid background music? and the treadmill noise makes it difficult to hear and understand voices. These headphones are great! They bring the voices out clearly, I wish I would have had them years ago. Only one slight problem, because they don't cup the ear they slide off your head if you bend down but you soon learn to steady them with one hand. My wife who has perfect hearing also loves them."
RRIQ5WG7KPKSS,5,"I received this headset as a gift about a month ago. It was purchased here on Amazon.<br /><br />I have it connected to my Panasonic Plasma TV, and it is clear and loud. I have rated it 5 stars because it works perfectly.<br /><br />However ...<br /><br />This headset requires a standard analog audio RCA input (red and white RCA connectors). These are common on most equipment except newer TVs. Most newer TVs have digital audio (aka S/PDIF) output. To connect one of these newer TVs to this headset requires a DC to Analog Converter (also called an adapter) and an optical cable. I bought this converter: AGPtek Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adapter. Here's the link here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DIRI6I/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.<br /><br />Then, you have to be careful to buy the right optical cable. There are two types of optical cable connectors; TOSLink and Digital Coax. You can buy cables with any combination of these connectors. The optical output from my TV is uses a TOSLink connector. The adapter I mentioned above has both types of connector inputs, so you just have to be careful to buy the cable that has the correct connector for your TV. I think most TVs have TOSLink outputs."
R3JQMG3G328JOI,5,"Very nice headphones. Was very pleased with the range, and sound quality. They are a little bulky, but very managable."
R3Q0T6RTBFTM8R,5,"This is my second set of wireless headphones. These have the best reception and work everywhere. For the price, I would say this is a great investment."
R23FKQ8UZSSWWE,4,"Would purchase again.  I have had several Sennheiser wireless headphones but this one is superior - to recharge it you just place it on the cradle at the end of the night and by morning you are done.  I am not sure that it really takes that long but that is how I do it. I have forgotten several nights in a row and only ran out of battery once since I purchased them.  I think their quality is great, the sound quality is crisp and clear and the headphones are comfortable."
R3546PR3FR8V5M,5,"My husband is hard of hearing and always had the TV turned up, now he can hear it without upsetting the whole household!"
R34MI7XT7OH7GA,4,"He loves the ability to walk from room to yard when necessary and not miss any of the play action.  The family loves the quiet.  No longer needing to shout to be heard over the TV.  It is a win, win situation."
R1QULF8W5YUQMG,5,"Headphones produce excellent sound quality.  The range is fantastic. I can get reception from anywhere in the house and on the porch. My music source is 100 feet away. Headphones are comfortable to wear but the only drawback is that they fit loosely and will fall off your head if you bend down. I can listen to the dialogue on TV and understand each word, while the room volume stays at a comfortable level for my spouse."
R3EYASRQ3BW96U,5,"Great sound, comfortable to wear, easy to hook up. Very pleased with the purchase. I have recommended them to others. They are great for the bedroom when one person stays up late watching TV and the other wants to sleep."
R25DAU0ERBX2XS,5,I love it. My husband uses it all the time and now the TV volume doesn't have to be blasting all the time. If I want to read in our living room we even put the TV on mute so I can enjoy my book. I would reccomend them to all couples who are getting a little older. My husband also loves the stereo effect they have.
R9TUPCRG6YNEZ,5,"Clear sound, easy to use, easy to charge, makes TV shows and movies so much easier to understand.  Ends disputes over how loud the TV should be."
R2L8DMBYFGQ6FN,5,"I have had others, but not many can touch Sennheiser. Just a overall very quality product. Does everything i need and then some."
R7IZZBA8PU76H,5,"The headphones are extremely quiet and easy to use.  They are a little bulky, but they cover your ears entirely so you can hear the TV or stereo perfectly.  I love them.  This is my second purchase. One for each bedroom."
R2IIYUJUSZW46O,5,I love these headphones so much I have two now.  The headphones are so comfortable on my head and the adjustments are on the headphones and easy to use.  The headphones recharge on the main unit when not in use so they are always charged when I want to watch TV.  My family loves that I don't have to turn the TV so loud.  These headphones are well worth the money.
R1L56GNJCXG1DB,5,Excellent for independent use of our radio and tv without disturbing others or subjecting them to my choices. Very comfortable.
R32M1KPKXFGKKM,4,The headphones work great and sound is very good.  Easy to install and can walk around the house and still hear the TV.  Reasonable price for a quality product.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.
R1TFCUC5JE3XJY,5,"After doing extensive research on-line, I decided on he Sennheiser RS 120 and man am I glad.  They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn and the clarity of sound is great. For the price, you cannot go wrong."
R1AHIB2KP8YITE,4,"I really like these headphones for use in my office.  The sound quality is great, and the wireless range is surprisingly good -- I have the unit base on my desk and I can walk about 30 feet away to the printer around the corner without any interruption in the reception. The only thing that could be improved about these headphones is the way they fit my head.  Initially when you put them on, all's well, but after about 45 min or so the top of my head and ears start to feel compacted.  I'd think they were designed to fit a man's head, unfortunately, and I'm a woman.  Maybe that's it..."
R1LV61OQ6JUYZ4,5,Bought these for my wife for her birthday last year and they're still working great 6 months later.  Just bought another pair for my father.
R3T46HHWE3KAKD,5,i got these for christmas 2 years ago and they are still as good a the day i put them on...highly recomended
R1ODYJRO6J4YJ3,1,"We bought this for my Dad and I shipped it to my home after he passed 6 months ago. It worked perfect until one channel died last night. I tried it on various devices and only the left channel functions. This was like new, hardly used. I can't believe the garbage died in one year.<br /><br />I just spent some time troubleshooting and the cheap little speaker in the headset went bad. I called Sennheiser and they do not carry internal parts. They told me to send it in for repair. The cost of that sends it into the garbage pile."
R12IU4FRONW4GR,5,"I have a hearing problem, but with my Sennheiser, I can watch TV while the ladies gab. It effectively creates another room. I have a second one to let me watch Netflix on my 27&#34; computer display."
R1BJ37BL6T08A7,5,My husband is an avid movie watcher and love to think the our living room is the movies theater and I was constantly saying can you please turn it down. Now I don't have to say it he has his very own listening device and loves them.
R3BVHY1IAR556A,5,"Shipped brand new, quickly, and efficiently.  I like the product, I can walk all the way around my business building with out any interference, about 100 ft I would say. Only thing I haven't liked is when I click anything on my computer with sound or any normal beep of the computer or program will turn down my music super far, and takes about 30-45 seconds to reach back to normal volume, but that is a luxury, and not needed and that is why I didn't let it effect the Stars I gave."
R26UG9JRGF0EUJ,5,"I bought these for a family member  so I could turn down the TV volume. Easy to use, comfortable, so everyone is happy."
R1O0AO2KFXJJPS,5,"After researching which headphone would help my father hear better, I was wondering if he would actually use them. He is nearly deaf and uses hearing aids, but still had issues hearing TV programs. He wears the headphones all the time. Great range, high quality, long battery life, easy to operate.  Price good GREAT quality."
R19VFW8AYMFQWC,3,"I purchased this product because my wife said I frequently had the TV to loud.  I also purchased from Amazon the FiiO Digital to Analog converter so I could connect the RS 120 to digital optical output of the TV.  The sound quality is clean and crisp. The primary reason I gave this three stars is because I could not keep the headphones on my ears for even one hour. They are just to uncomfortable. I am returning this product to Amazon and have replaced it with the Sony MDRDS6500 digital headphones 2.4GHz from Amazon. Yes, I paid more for the Sony but what good are headphones if you can't wear them?"
R298SQ5GMJXAU5,4,"These headphones are the best.<br />I liked them so much, that I showed them to a neighbor, who is hard of hearing and ended up having to order her a pair."
R3HJK5WYLD7HGZ,5,These headphones are great. They are very comfortable and easy to use and rechargeable. Recharging is easy and quick and we use them constantly.
R2PFVOYILYPDKM,1,"Let me preface this by saying I really wanted this to work. I prefer not to use 'cabled' headphones.  I gave the product two opportunities, by getting a replacement, but still had issues.<br /><br />So regarding this product, on the positive side, I was pleased with the sound quality of the headphones.  They also had a respectable range.  What didn't work well--and this was the showstopper--was the cradle.  There is an auto on/off broadcasting feature which turns on when sound is streaming into the cradle unit (and is then routed to the headphones), and then shuts off after a few minutes of receiving no such input (for instance, if you 'pause' your movie, or turn off your television/applifier).  The problem is, the feature is not stable.  Sometimes it will turn on when it is suppose to (once sound begins to stream again), but other times it will not.  The work around is to unplug it from your headphone jack, and then plug it back in.  Now, if this were the ONLY issue with the auto on/off feature, I would rate it 3 stars, for being mildly inconvenient. However, the feature has more serious issues.  On my first go-around with the product, after less than days of use, the auto on/off broadcast feature stopped working.  The unit would stay 'on' for 4 minutes, and then inexplicable turn off DURING my movies, while I was active watching them.  turning the TV on/off or pausing and starting the moving would do nothing to fix the issue.  And it tried using both the headphone jacks and the RCA output jacks.  It made no difference.  So I struck it up to a defective unit, and had Amazon send me a new pair.<br /><br />Less than two days later, I got my new set.  This one lasted for nearly a full week of daily use, until the auto on/off stopped working on the cradle unit on the replacement as well (it would shut off after about 4 minutes of program streaming).  Once again, I tried both the headphone jacks and RCA out jacks, but nothing worked.<br /><br />Now, if there was a way to DISABLE the auto on/off feature so that it broadcast full time, I would have probably bumped my rating up to 4+ stars.  But sadly, there is no way to disable the feature.  The fact that I had an identical issue with two units (and not right away--so it's kind of like a ticking time bomb), is very discouraging."
R8RMBSZRP9F0P,4,"The sound quality is good (for it's price).  I use this headphone in the lab and get some interference here and there.  It's somewhat of a distraction to me.  Other than that, it works well.  It's better to turn up the source level than the headphone level to avoid loud static noise when the base auto-shutoffs if the audio source no longer outputs the audio signal."
RJ4KM4GVD3C92,4,"I like the headphones.  In many reviews they mention a lot of static, but I didn't find that to be the case.  I have used them for a couple of weeks now and they work well for my needs.  I am a programmer so they are excellent at my desk and when I wander around my team area. However they do not have the claimed 300+ ft distance.  I can get about 100' on the same floor without any walls before the static starts to overtake the music. I can go about 50' before they start popping and have audio issues.  Once a wall or a floor gets between me and the transmitter the range decreases considerably but they are good enough to make it through my two story + basement house of  3000+ sqft.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with the product, I just wish the range was what they said."
R1CSX1RNRKORD5,5,"Have tried many headsets.  Need over ear (not earbud in the ear) because I wear two hearing aids.  And want to still hear other things in the house when listening to TV.  Cannot use TV sound directly because I have to make it too loud for everyone else, is to aggravating elsewhere for people in the house due to the loudness, and/or too base-y.  These are perfect; especially if using line-out (not volume controlled) on a TV.  Line out allows you to adjust volume on the headset for your needs with hearing aids in tact.  While still allowing others in the room to have regular TV speakers on at a volume they need.  These feel comfortable after hours of wear -- do not feel them heavy on the ears or head at all.  Being wireless, can go to the bathroom, kitchen, etc without missing the program sound like when using regular speakers on the TV.  Perfect for still hearing the phone and other sound in the house while listening to TV or music.  Have only had them a week and only used 3-4hrs at a stretch so cannot speak to longevity of the battery.  Although this unit has replaceable batteries, not just rechargeable. Replaceable is a big plus given others like TVEars have the battery soldered in and the whole headset must be thrown out when the batteries go bad after a year; from what I read.."
R3FDCNNF5J3AM0,5,I originally bought the headphones for my 87 year old mother who has a serious hearing problem.  She loves the headphones and so does everyone else in the house because the TV does not have to be at full volume so she can hear it.  I then discovered that I too love the headphones because the sound is so clear.  I bought myself a pair too.  I would recommend to anyone no matter your age.
R6COKMOFC0824,5,Thought they didn't work but now I like them. It took half a day of frustration and research to get these to work ... but it turned out I just didn't push the connector all the way in at the connection to my TV. I got these to allow me to watch my amazon instant movies on my samsung &#34;Smart TV&#34; and they work great ... they are big so there is no rolling to one side to watch ... bonus: I can use them while exercising on my elliptical ... my elliptical makes too much noise which means even with the volume on my TV all the way at 100 I still don't get everything ... with these I can hear perfectly ... I will update this review to let you know how things are going ... I say ... go ahead and get them ... I already have gotten my monies worth.<br /><br />Edit: Still love them and I still use them daily since I bought them. Great to watch TV at a good volume without everyone else hears silence.
R1B847HGGQHED8,4,The sound is great and the charging cradle is very easy to put the headphone back after use. The only regret is that we couldn't connect to our blue ray player we have. We are connecting our satellite box for the tv only now.
R33WA4RNUW3HJO,5,I could not use it with my big ass TV as it requires a digital to analog out.....most modern TVs have digital out...so u will need a adapter....
R16MINH6OPP2A0,2,"With a zillion reviews posted this is probably a waste of time but here goes.  Way back in the day Sennheiser meant innovation, awesome sound, great value, so I expected to be blown away by these.  I wasn't.  Maybe I've been spoiled (my house and my current and previous cars have or had subwoofers) but I thought the bass was puny.  The hiss was disconcerting even after reading a review that nailed the problem as automatic level control (ALC) kicking in.  I also noticed distortion, lots of it, in the mids and highs when cranking up the volume.<br /><br />I thought the problem must be on my end so I tried different sources...an iPod Touch, a Windows PC, another Windows PC, a rooted Nook Color (essentially an Android tablet).  Tried different genres...Debussy, M83, Type O Negative...some blazing loud passages, some nearly silent.<br /><br />Then I tried some cheaper wireless phones that I've had for years to listen to podcasts @ work (Audio Unlimited SPK-9110).  No hiss, a lot less distortion but the bass was weak with them too.<br /><br />So I dug into my airline carry-on bag and found an old set of JVC HA-NC80 noise canceling wired phones.  I don't remember what I paid but I do remember that they were relatively inexpensive.  I put in a fresh battery and tried them out and WOW - they blow the Sennheisers away in every respect.  Actually they sounded best with the noise cancelling entirely off.  I also compared my MEE HT-21 phones but while they are excellent for use on an airplane, they just don't have the bass response I want on the ground.<br /><br />I'm going to return these Sennheisers.  As much as I'd like wireless phones for my purpose it seems crazy to give up bass response and endure hiss and distortion.  So I guess my recommendation is to think seriously about how badly you need wireless.  If all you want are podcasts and TV, the Audio Unlimited model I mentioned will do the trick very well for a lot less money (just replace the cheap rechargeable AAA batteries it comes with before you even charge it up for the first time).<br /><br />I'm really surprised that I'm having unkind things to say about a Sennheiser product."
RY070B0OKMH3X,5,Works great!!  My wife is now able to listen to the TV and not miss out on the conversations.  Definitely considering buying a second pair.
R2D7QXA8B232QI,5,"These headphones are very good. The sound quality is wonderful, the wireless works well. I have no complaints with these headphones at all. They are comfortable enough, the battery life is great (never had an issue). The charging is extremely simple as well. Easy to set-up, overall great product. I would definitely recommend."
R2O6O73V7RNQXI,5,"i'm a senior citizen and was having problems with hearing some of the dialogue on some of the programs.  Not anymore - - I can hear everything as clear as a bell and love my headphones.  I don't need them for everything but when I do, it is wonderful.  Another important feature for me was that it was very simple to set up.  Would recommend very highly if you are having problems with hearing your favorite program."
R394SS2M0AB0I0,3,"These are ok. The ear pieces are made of cloth and they can get a little itchy. Not good for exercising because they fall of if you bend over, and the ear pieces get very soggy with sweat. The sound is good enough. They are a bit clunky, so you can't lie on your side on the couch and watch TV. I use them mostly to watch Movies quietly while other people in the house are sleeping. Works good for that."
R1BJ6E1ZCU0D61,5,These are the best wireless headphones i have ever owned. Use them every night to watch tv. My hearing is starting to go and these clearify the words that i can hear them better. The back ground sounds come in now and sometimes i think a bee is around my head when they are in the background in movies.
R17JM5MW962KD9,1,"If you're lucky enough to get the AV cord plugged into the tiny DC in on the transmitter it doesn't work anyway. $85 down the drain, thanks for nothing"
RE11IQU5LQFCC,5,"I originally bought a pair of thesse becuse I am hard of hearing and I would have the TV so loud you could hear it at your house!! They worked perfectly for me and I could turn the volume of the TV off to give my wife, dog and neighbors ( I live on 13 acres! ) some peace!<br /><br />One day my wife grabbed the headphones and she was hooked.......you hear stuff you never heard before.  Especially great when watching concerts.<br /><br />We now have 4 sets for every TV.  These are the greatest.......they work perfectly and have very good sound reproduction. These are especially good if you want to watch TV in bed and not disturb your partner or want to watch a different program than your partner in a rooms that are close or open and the two TV's would normally clash,"
R1LHKUEOXO9REA,4,"We bought these headset to be able to watch TV and movies while one sleeps or sometimes a bit louder. After using them a while we decided to bought the Sennheiser RS 170 and we came back on the RS 120 as they where more comfortable.<br /><br />The sound quality for dialog is very clear, for loud actions and music it could be better.<br /><br />The reception of the signal could be better, as when you turn your head you hear noise."
R3A1LK29TS4O5M,3,"I ordered these headphones for music recording.  While the headphones worked fine for gaming, music, etc., they were definately not adequate for recording.  You have to tune the headphones to match the frequency of the base.  While there was a fairly large sweet spot, I could never completely remove the white noise.  Maybe this is a problem with most wireless headphones, but these are the first pair I decided to try.  While recording it is important that their be absolutely no background noise to ensure clear audio when recording, so this product was not fit for my purpose, but overall, the product functioned as advertised."
R2CFODGALK4LSK,5,"I ordered on a Friday and it was in my mailbox the next Wednesday.  The entire unit was bubble wrapped and arrived in perfect condition.  I was a little apprehensive about buying refurbished from a non-factory location, but a little investigation showed that ADGtron's reputation was worth the risk.  It paid off.  The headphones are clear, free of hiss and exactly what I wanted.  I can't understand why I even considered paying $20 more for a box."
R12VJBZF9P7YDK,3,"This product is alright, it does what it suppose to do. Nothing impressive about it. End up switching to Logitech."
R2S62043JJIO6B,5,The sound is so clear with surround sound! You can hear the birds singing & the water running in the background! I gave one of these to my dad who is 80 years old and hard of hearing. He can hear the TV better and clearer with this headphone. So easy to assemble! I purchased 2 of these 4 years ago with no problems and works just as good today as it did the first day! AWESOME PRODUCT!
R2EKW83AR1JAVU,4,"These wireless RF headphones are a vast improvement over my old Advent set, but they're not perfect.  Sound is great (the earlier tip about disabling automatic volume control on the TV was right on), but there are 2 shortcomings that bug me.  First, they're not what I would call 'over-ear' but rather 'on-ear', as they sit flat on the ear.  There are no circumferential pads to hold the phones off of my ears themselves.  Second, and most annoying, they'll slip right off your head at the slightest provocation.  I've learned to hold my head very still, walking almost like the old bits about models learning to walk with a book balanced on their heads.  If they weren't so prone to falling off, I'd have given them the 5th star.  All in all I'm very glad I bought them.  Good value."
ROOO5BISDPPT7,5,"I have purchased several of these style headphones in the past several years, some for myself, and a few for relatives. So far this has been the best one. Most of the others broke or fell apart completely. This one works great with any of my tv's, video players, computer and Bose speakers. Utilizing the provided cables and a few attachments I already had it was a snap to hook up to anything. The batteries have never died on me and I have done Netflix marathons with little to no breaks for charging. My five year old watches cartoons with them sometimes, they can slide off if you put your head down, but that will happen with any of these. It is great to watch anything I want without disturbing sleeping family members or other tv shows/conversations. You also feel like you are in the movie with the quality of sound. I highly recommend these."
R3MN73FZAIENHW,1,"We returned these right away. They do not fit well at all and hurt your ears/head. They do not fit around your ears, they just sit on top."
R3C05AHJZGSBM7,5,"The headphones work just like they said. I can walk into the yard, the basement hands free. The sound is clear. The service was good."
R1CW7MWT7TYV0D,1,The hissing that others have complained about was unbearable.  I sent the headphones back immediately.  Have not yet seen that my account was credited though.
R1NSUMNNB626AK,5,These headphones are superb. Once they are charged they work extremely well. The key is to make sure they are turned off and placed back on the charger for your next use.
R26AUBGHUVV7EC,5,Ordered this for loving spouse who tends to stay up watching TV way after I have called it a day.  It works great especially for the tight quarters in our RV. He is able to continue to enjoy his programs while I enjoy quiet sleep. Small charging cradle stores easily in cabinet below TV and headphones always charged and ready for use. Very pleased with product!!
R33BW6PKPYX1RR,5,My husband and I are both hard of hearing and in our mid to late 70's.  These headphones are terrific!  There is no static at all and they are very comfortable. Would highly recommend them. Only thing is was a little difficult to set up - my husband went to Radio Shack for help several times.  Great product.
RE6UU8FFT5LJ4,1,I ordered this item as a Christmas gift and the recipient received the gift on February 1st and was able to use it only a couple of time before it stopped working.
R39UFHU2R1CS6J,1,"Headphones are not just poor products but really bad value. The system often switches off randomly, and gets awful static interference every 20 minutes or so, making them virtually unusable. I might expect problems like this on a $20 pair, but for $80 that is really bad."
R30E202UOWG9PR,2,"This is the worst pair of wireless headphones I have ever purchased. They have one annoying characteristic after another. Terrible debilitating static if they don't recognize an audio signal immediately, completely flat felt earpieces permit the headphones to fall off if one permits their head to pass the horizontal plane meaning you have to keep your head tilted up if you bend over to pick something up, the worst signal range of any wireless headphones I have had and I have had several, the channel selector turns like the volume control permitting the signal to be lost if it is touched even slightly in hanging the headphones for chargine or whatever meaning the next time you put them on, no signal, ergo, the static, lousy battery connectors permit the batteries to pop out when the headphones fall off (see above). I am sure there are other annoying characteristics that I have overlooked, but this would seem to be sufficient to get my point across. Good grief, one expects products to get better over the years, not worse. After saying all this, I will close by saying that the sound quality is quite good and the charging station seems to be well designed resulting in the 2nd star."
R2PMWRCSV093OO,5,Great - works perfectly. Headset has clear sound with no distortion or hissing noise. Range is fantastic - works to at least 100 feet.
R7URQJ35CZWAI,4,"I've replace a Sony RF925R with the Sennheiser RS120 because although the Sony headset was extremely comfortable, it suffered constantly from intermittent static.  The Sennheiser 120 audio is excellent, too bad nobody at Sennheiser bothered to wear a set of their headphones for more than a few minutes.....or they too would be saying &#34;OUCH!&#34;  So, here's my evaluation:  put the Sennheiser audio components in a pair of Sony headphones and REALLY enjoy what you are listening to for EXTENDED periods of time.l"
RBGZ2EK6T2DZJ,2,I have a widescreen with a quality sound bar I bought this so my wife doesn't have to listen to my action movies.  Well this thing is so low a sound level and the quality not good that I'm sending them back. If you want quality go with something else
R297JPO6LWUU8B,4,"Like many married individuals, my wife complains about the TV volume. I had TV ears, but the hurt my ears. The RS 120's work very well. Volume adjustment could be better. Warning, this does not solve the problem with the wife. When wearing the headphones your wife will get mad because you do not answer when she is talking to you, but you can hear the TV."
R4BJZHRW1L17Q,1,"These headphones are uncomfortable, they do not work and the sound quality is poor.  Even if you are in line of sight mode, you can only obtain sound from one earpiece.  The channel selector is useless.  I imagine that it is not even connected to anything.  It reminds me of one of the fourteen dollar Walkie-Talkies I used to get at Radio Shack.  Stay far away from this product, although even if you were near it wouldn't make any difference!!!!"
REQSVYIO7P59J,5,"Purchased to allow teenage son to watch TV evening hours without the rest of the house hearing as well. Sound is excellent, blocks out surrounding noise. Comfortable to wear. Able to walk around house and hear while wearing. Little too heavy/bulky to wear on treadmill though.  Very pleased overall!!"
R2099A23IE72VB,5,I purchased these headphones for my mother. She is elderly and lives in an apartment and didn't want to turn her tv up loud as it would bother her neighbors. She says these headphones are great. I like them for her because they are easy for her to recharge. Simply set the headphones on the cradle. I am thinking about getting some of these for myself.
R3LTNJA32MDQ23,5,Replaced previous head phones.  Have serious hearing issues.  More than meets my  andneeds.  Love the ability to walk around house and still hear.
R2XLIJ6BYKI093,4,"I love these headphones and bought 2. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is because of the immediate loud static that they emit when the TV volume is either too low, muted or any reason your TV is not emitting sound."
R2HKF0B1QGDOW5,5,I got this so my wife could sleep while I watch TV in bed. What I hadn't counted on was just how great the quality of sound is. Now I hear everything that is said and music sounds awesome. The stereo quality was way better than I had expect and I can finally hear the bass.
R2JGU1R8BQXYDB,5,"These headphone are fabulous.  They fit well, and the sound is terrific.  It sounds like surround sound.  They are also very, very easy tp place on the charger. I have another brand and they do not fit well, and it is very difficult to place on the charger.  You cannot go wrong with these headphones. Crisp, clear sound and comfortable to wear.  I doubt you can find a better pair for the price. 5 star rating for sure!"
R2FDOSD9LLD72C,5,"I bought these for my husband and he loves to watch TV with them. The sound quality is superb  and it allows him to watch his TV at any hour without disturbing anyone else. The only drawback is that they must be placed on their charger in a very specific manner or they will not charge but once you get use to it, it is fine. He especially loves to use them when he is watching one of the BBC programs, as he struggles less with the British accents when he has these headphones on. High marks for an excellent product."
R23222M82GIFTH,5,The only complaint I have is that they are not over the ear.  When you bend forward the headphones will fall off.  The sound quality and reception is great.
R2YC7ZI368UNUR,5,"I was looking for a headset to hook up to the TV.  I looked at a Sony and tried it, but did not like it.  It's amazing at how good the sound quality is.  You can here background sounds, like someone crinkling paper or background conversations.  The versatility of not having any wires is great too."
R18SONND91J3BP,3,"At least for me, he headphones clamp entirely too tight.  Sound is great, but trying to watch TV is not comfortable."
R220172RLZBJNG,4,"This review is more about the FCC-regulated rules that manufacturers have to comply to to avoid breaking the law. I purchased this unit about two weeks ago, and while I do detect a slight background hiss that more than compensates for the wire-wrestling I used to have to do. HOWEVER, the FCC stipulates that when a device no longer receives a signal it needs to be shut off after a specified time. That means Sennheiser makes the base unit turn off when you pause the source signal (TV, DVR, etc.). Result....ear-piercing static. I've exchanged several emails with Sennheiser, and they claim there's nothing they can do. I'm not convinced, however. This experience has made me consider looking at alternatives, because I do care about my hearing and don't want to be looking at hearing loss due to this."

R3C955KA2LLZVO,5,"After suffering for a while with Bluetooth headphones I finally broke down and bought some more expensive wireless headphones. There's something to be said for manual (manual on/off, manual volume) - as compared to most bluetooth headphones being electronic controls that have a delay as you press to hold them or have to jab at them until you get the right volume. Maybe I being old-fashioned. But there's nothing old-fashioned about the Sennheiser's peformance. The sound is rich and the bass is deep. The channel is crystal clear and there's never been an issue with losing or having to re-pair my headphones in bluetooth as a device on the mac. It really just doesn't work well, at least for me. Whenever the phones are off or lose contact, it's always a roll of the dice if the computer recognizes the bluetooth headphones. Happily, with a fixed link from the audio output on the Sennheiser radio unit, those days are long gone."
R1JDL6ZVSUTF9R,5,"After reading good reviews, I bought this for my husband who is very picky and hard to please. He loves this headset and kept thanking me for getting it for him."
ROD06RNCBJKI3,1,wont work in my house<br />static and hiss<br />bought the RCA for 30bucks<br />no hiss no static works well in my house
R2EH7UQ3NYE40Z,2,I dislike this product because it's not loud enough and I can only hear from the right side of the headphone and I can hear back ground noise. I also had the Sennheiser RS110 in California it worked well their but when i moved to Hawaii I could never get it to work even when I bought a new  one. Maybe because I don't have it hooked up right.
R3A7ZSYD2VZHPJ,4,Really like the rechargeable feature .... (should save on buying batteries)<br />Sound is great!<br />It would be even better if there was more distance between the volume control and the channel tuner (occasionally will get the wrong one when adjusting the volume).
RP5IS1IDZDNYX,5,"First let me be clear about one thing.  I bought these for my wife so she could watch TV until all hours.  She's getting a little hard of hearing (I think its selective) and loves to turn the volume up.  She works late nights and I get up at 4 AM to open the store so you can see the potential conflict here.  I have a severe hearing loss but I still hear the TV from downstairs at 2 AM.<br /><br />I have never used theses headphones myself except for the initial set up.  They were connected and working in under five minutes.  It took longer to get them out of the box than to hook them up.  The rechargeable batteries had plenty of power in them out of the box but after the intial trial run we let them charge overnight.  My wife absolutely loves them and therefore, so do I!<br /><br />If you are looking for an easy to install, good quality wireless headphone set, then look no further.  Unless you are a true audiophile and have hearing much better than average, then these are more than adequate for most of us."
RWGX8EJR03OVG,4,Found that on some TV shows dialogue was difficult to hear. Not sure if that was related to signal but raising volume did not help. Since using these head phones with volume turned low no problem at all with dialogue . Easy set up and I experience no interference or background noise.  Do not use them all of the time but with movies or extended dialogue they are very good!  No need to crank up volume in fact turn TV volume off!
R1OS78H6YLTOQX,4,"These work well, good sound and long battery life.  I have used at a range of 30 feet with no distortion.  No way to tighten in lateral direction so may fall off of narrower heads.  Only minor complaint would be the switches are small with sharp edges, they feel cheap and dated but have still work fine."
RY2DZCJCF1N0X,5,"Okay, these aren't the right headphones if you're looking for an audiophile experience. But hey, they cost less than a hundred bucks - what do you expect?<br /><br />They're lightweight and comfortable, and the sound quality doesn't suck. Our first pair performed well over five years of moderately heavy use before the transmitter stopped working. Sennheiser tech support was helpful and efficient in diagnosing the problem, and quickly admitted that it would cost more to fix than to replace the unit. But then the tech went a step beyond and suggested that if we were going to buy a new unit, we should keep the old one since the stand still works as a charger and the headphones still receive a signal.<br /><br />So we bought a new RS120, and now two of us can use headphones at the same time. If the new ones break (hopefully not for another five years), we'll have to decide if we want three."
R2401VK5W02GNI,4,My only complaint is that I should have purchased the model that has the charger in the base instead of having to remove the batteries to recharge.
R2G5E4P7NUY64O,2,This item has not performed properly since the second time it was used.  The company had me return it for repair. They sent it back to me claiming it was repaired.  The first time it was used it operated well for about two hours.  It then started cutting off and on as had been the case before I had returned it.  It appears that they have not corrected the faulty problem in the base unit.  I have stopped using the item because of its operational unreliability.  I will attempt again to return it for warranty repair.  This unit is great when it operates properly but it is of little use when the Base unit cuts out at will.
R3NGB4YJRG2NZK,5,"Works great when I want to watch TV but my wife wants to sleep.  Crystal clear sound.  The tuning and volume wheels are easy to confuse because they are close together.  Instead of using the old RCA jacks, I wish it at least had component cables."
R2EGF92XZGHNRL,5,"Very little interference,and will operate a long distance from base. Headphones are very comfortable.Nice to be able to recharge with base unit."
R36N9TMCATNCGI,1,"These are good only if you sit upright and still.  Otherwise, they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt."
RE82MSO8OCO8W,5,"Can walk anywhere in my house, and still pick of the audio. If there is anything better out there, I would like to know the name of the products. Price was fair too."
R3H6NYRA9LAY8U,4,Can watch my tivo in the bedroom and in the living room through the wall.  Like that the charging cradle can be mounted to the wall.  The sound is not as deep and the earpieces do not fit as snugly on the ears as the top end Sennheisers.
R2B2NXLW83A7FA,3,"Well, the sound is not Bose but then the headset didn't cost as much as Bose.  I've decided that most drama shows on TV have background music that is actually loader than the people who are speaking.  Can't figure that one out unless the musicians union is stronger than the actors guild."
R2WQWFQ2ELW3S6,5,lik i have said before this set does the job for my  very had of hearing man and saves my ear drums from how loud he has to have the tv but only complaint is the stretch out after such all time use
R31D1OPXUZI02B,5,"This is the second set I've owned.  Very comfortable, much more so than the in-the-ear cheaper ones.  Very much worth the extra cost."
RLITAJSJ3JFTY,5,"After trying several other brands of wireless headphones which quicky failed,  this set has been is great. I am very happy with the quality of the sound. The only disclaimer is that is if you want to drown out background noise, this one won't do very well, due to the fact that it sits on the ear, and not around it.  I have used it regularly for several months with no problems."
R3U0BC9UJO7TGJ,4,"I'm no audiophile and don't expect that these wireless cans will impress such folk, but they work great for quiet TV viewing at night. I got a pair of these just to be able to watch TV on occasion without disturbing anyone who is sleeping, and for that these are stellar. They have perfectly acceptable sound and they are comfortable enough to wear for a show or two without fatigue. I don't watch much TV - but when I am able it is generally late at night and so these really are a boon."
R1PLT70PY32LOD,4,Ordered about 7 weeks ago and have been very pleased with this product.  Only problem - the headphones become uncomfortable for me after about 3 hours of use.  Great for those of us who have a hearing problem.
RPYXDR9VJAXR1,5,These earphones are great.  My wife is Hearing Impaired and we have three sets that are connected to 3 different televisions.  She uses them throughout our entire house with No Problem.  They have made &#34;listening&#34; to television a Pleasurable experience.
R2G6GVNS929E0X,2,"The little dial used to &#34;tune&#34; this headset in to your station is near impossible. I really like Sennheiser, but the Model 120 failed me terribly. The headset itself is okay; yes, I said okay - not great, but it isn't uncomfortable or heavy to use. The manual tuning is the main reason I returned it. I am upgrading to a more suitable model."
RPD4S1ETANIKH,5,"Bought these because i owned a set of Sennheisers  way back,(rock days ) when i payed about 40bucks for a set with a cable, and loved them as well. Wife wanted a good set of wireless, these are Excellent and she just thanked me again for finding these . We can go outside on our porch and listen with a cup of coffee, or in any room in our 1500 sq ft Home no problems. They do not wrap around the ears so you can still hear other sound you might want , like a car drive up etc, for us living in the country we need to listen for our animals as well. They are light and airy and are planning to get another pair so we have two available. Also we find with our mature, older hearing they are great for not missing things on News or TV, and our Favorite Coast 2 Coast Radio Broadcasts . We recommend them highly for regular users, if you can afford to go more then try the Kleer 160s and above, but they will set you back double the cost of these 120s Which are very adequate for daily use. We are thankful that Sennheisers are still made -Great Job ! All the Best from high up in the Ozark Hills ."
R1YNNK6G6FSR2W,5,bought these for late night tv viewing since our bedroom is next to the living room and my girlfriend is a light sleeper.<br /><br />wow the sound from these is awesome.  range is simply amazing!  easily hit 75 feet with a clear signal even though a walls and i've even ventured to the basement and still get a perfect signal.<br /><br />rechargeable batteries are a plus although i'm not sure how long they will last (before needing to be replaced) I'm more than happy with their performance after a month.
R2FW6XKN251K3J,5,"I love it, It rates 5 stars in every way. I couldn't be more pleased with it.Great product, the sound is great. Jerry"
R1WV9MIWPX4KWF,5,A friend of mine had one and talked about how great it was.  I decided to purchase one and don't know how I managed without it. Even when I had the TV turned up loud I still couldn't understand some of the dialog (so much TV background noise)  I love it and would highly recommend it.
R29FYPS8QNZFUH,4,Bought these for my husband so the TV doesn't have to be blarring.  He seems to enjoy them and the range seems to be good.
R1U4OK66THN3H8,1,"Would not work. cheaply made not Sennheiser best. I have had ten dollar headphones that work 100 times better,never again!!!!"
R15NEEL4A1DP6B,4,I use these everyday to listen to slacker on my galaxy sII at work.  good sound and charge last all workday.
RIZS0RCW41KM8,4,"These headphones are high quality .  The sound is beautiful...at times it feels like I am at the theater with surround sound. My only criticism is the buttons which control the on/off and volume and tone are very small for me as I'm loosing sensitivity in the tips of my fingers. Also, I am having difficulty adjusting the headpiece .  However, these headphones are fairly new and I am sure I will do better when I have had them for a while. I can walk around my complete first floor, which is fairly open but spacious and still receive the great tone.  I have had others, but these are just what I was hoping for.  They were recommended by a friend who also loves his."
R11TQYPM6RBQ1I,5,Quick and easy review: I bought a second one of these because Sennheiser makes great quality headphones!<br />The range is great and they sound ok after you get them tunned in!
R37S1DTEORVFWS,5,"Being hard of hearing, I have tried several different Wireless Headphones with poor results.  After buying the Sennheiser RS 120 there is no comparrison in sound qualty of the oters that I have used."
R2ZJFH0XEZ1C4L,5,The headphones were what we expected. The setup was easy and we were up and running in no time literally as we wear them while we are on the treadmill.
R28YC8MTX5M8QY,5,"Not only is this a great set of headphones, but this opens up wonderful opportunities. With young kids, it's not easy to watch exciting action movies with them around. It's also not easy to watch the movies on our larger TV after they go to sleep, as the volume has to remain low to keep the from possibly waking up. These wireless headphones solve that issue, and they sound wonderful..."
R3IUKIGKFIRPLE,3,"Purchased for my husband who is 92 years old and extremely! hard of hearing.  Used this product at a friend's house, and he really loved it and said he could hear very clearly every word and stated that he wanted one of these himself.  Got info sheet from friend who also purchased his on Amazon (Don Edwards, Boone Ave. St. Louis Park, MN. 55426).  Came home and ordered it TODAY (2/24/13).  My husband has been using TVEars brand.  He said NO CAMPARISON AT ALL to the Sennheiser headphone.  Matter of fact, he has nothing BUT trouble with the TVEars.  Can't wait for the shipment to get here."
R20ZKBGSPCE4QH,5,"My husband loves these headphones.  We have two pair.  With the Sony TV it plugs into an earphone outlet when using the headphones and we have to remove it from that outlet to receive normal volume.  With the new TV it plugs into an optical outlet and we don't have to get up, go to the TV and remove the plug in order to get normal volume..  You do need an optical to analog converter though."
R2XUPS2X5F0YFO,5,"I wear hearing aids, but by the end of the day, I'm ready to remove them. I use my headphones to watch TV in the evenings. I can have the volume set based on my hearing ability without driving everyone else in the house crazy. They are lightweight, crystal clear and wireless. I'm well pleased."
R155JDD4FFAAE5,2,Excellent quality while it worked. I tried it on for 20 minutes after 2 weeks from the delivery. The power supply failed. I tried different outlets. NIX. It was dead. I am returning it as of now.
RWQ06JNV5JSD5,4,"The headphones do not fit as well as I would like. When I lean my head forward they tend to slip off. I had a previous set that had a cupped design and I found them more comfortable over extend listening times. Unfortunately they had a bad design on the attachment of the speakers to the headband snd broke after 2 years of occasional wearing. These phones seem to have a more sturdy design. The sound is generally good with only an occasional click.<br />Pros: Cost, sound quality<br />Cons: Comfort and over ear design."
R2V21NAFL9UBRK,4,I bought these to drown out background noise at work. they do that but make my ears sore after awhile.
R3IX4077V4WQX3,4,"I bought these elsewhere about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />I am a 76 old with not great hearing.  Both my wife and myself had found it necessary to use closed captioning for most of our tv watching. That is true even though we do have an older but fairly decent 5.1 sound system. Also, our personal schedules are such that I like to watch tv (including netflix) in bed until far later than she does. Thus, the tv's sound being on bothered her.<br /><br />The Sennheiser 120s leak a little sound, but not enough to bother my wife.  Their use dramatically improved my enjoyment of TV.  I now watch it without captions and only spasmodically lose a few words of dialogue.  I don't why the improvement is so dramatic, but I can flat out say it is.<br /><br />My hookup may be a little different than most.  We have a new lg plasma tv that only has one sound output and that is optical digital (toslink).  The tv does have 3 hdmi inputs.  My older amp/receiver only has an 2 optical and one coax digital inputs.  It has no digital outputs nor hdmi inputs or outputs.  Thus my hookup consists of:<br /><br />  1.  A roku box for netflix, a BD player, and a uverse receiver are all hooked up to the tv via hdmi cables. I could have used only two<br />  hdmi inputs because the BD player is a smart wireless player that also provides netflix.  I just already had the roku and prefer<br />  using it.<br />  2.  The lone tv optical output is hooked up to the amp/receiver optical input via an optical cable.<br />  3.  The Sennheiser transmitter is set up as otherwise instructed as to power and then plugged into the headphone jack on front of the<br />  amp using the transmitter's cable and the supplied 1/4\\"" adapter plug.<br />  4.  The amp sound volume is set at or slightly above my normal listening level and then adjusted using the Senn's volume control.<br /><br />The result is my amp automatically puts out excellent 2 channel stereo sound for whichever hdmi output I am currently using on the tv.  Thesound system speakers are automatically turned off.  The TV speakers can be on so my wife can listen or they can be muted. If they are on, I have no sound sync issues.<br /><br />The Sennheiser's sound did definitely improve some after break in.  The bass became at least noticeable and dialogue became a little clearer.<br /><br />My cons would be that to my taste the bass is just a little too weak.  Also, for some reason, the backup music and sounds you hardly notice without headphones can at times become loud enough to almost intrude on the listening experience.<br /><br />I really like these headphones.  They have done an amazing job of making our tv watching experience much more enjoyable.  However, I do wonder if a quality wired set, although less convenient, might improve the experience even more.  Therefore, I did just order the Audio Technica ATH-M50s phones plus a 15' foot 1/4\\"" extension cable from Amazon.  If the M50s are an improvement I'll move the Senn 120s into the living room.  Otherwise I'll use them in the computer room."
R1CZ2QVEJT8Q87,4,i can listen music anywhere in my house. Perfect for you tube music and listening  audible books. I enjoy it.
RZQWGHETRGOMH,2,I'm quite disappointed by the sound of these headphones because it's at the end like listening the FM radio even if you have a nice stereo. What's more the reception is very sensitive to any electric device at home and that's very annoying.<br />The headphones by themselves are very flat and not comfortable. There are not stable on your head.
R3E4XQ409SNKDI,4,"Got these headphones on a special deal. They come with a couple of adapters for Tv, stereo and aux etc. I got them to listen to TV without bothering my spouse and for the price they sound pretty good. I like the charging stand, albeit you have to place the charger by the item you're listening to. They aren't super comfortable but they're definitely worth the price."
R3LY8QIN1YF2C0,5,"I am haed of hearing and this has great sound and good distance. Sound quality is awsome, no static. Great buy!!"
R1SOTQGGO95MEA,5,They are everything they advertised as far as performance goes.They could be a little more comfortable with possibly a different style cup but I'm perfectly pleased with them
R182GXK5YNQDCN,1,"If you do not with to have  hair on your head, use his headset. The connecting  band, which is configured to be the means of charging it, will grab your hair and pull it off. Regrettably, I only noticed this after losing  about a third of my hair.  The thin plastic covering of the earcups also wears out quickly. It becomes a torn and tattered mess after about a year."
R2E8OSS2SJ7IYA,5,"I use it daily, good sound quality and allows privacy or sound adjustment for my wife at her discretion.  The charging system is convenient and sure beats the first system I bought requiring replaceable batteries. It was affordable."
RQ61DTRC5T7JF,5,After flying helicopters for 41 years my hearing is shot. These headphones allow me to hear the dialog which has been difficult to understand on TV. I can listen to music and hear it in true stereo. Should have purchased these years ago.
R2EMGKCSG3V0OG,4,"Wish the ear fittings were a little softer so they would fit better.  They are hard, and allow ambient noise to interfere with the reception to a degree.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase.  They were a good value, but there are a lot of similar products on the market for the same price, or even lower."
R2KCDUQS9RJDEB,5,"This wireless headphone is a good option over those $100 devices. The sound quality could be a little better, but for the price I don't think anybody will complaint"
RW4J9RLUR5TTO,4,"The Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headphones are perfect for my situation. I am very impressed with the range and extended battery life I get from them. My old pair only lasted about 8 hours without charging. The Sennheiser's go at least 12 or more. I haven't had an opportunity to use them longer than that so I don't know when they quit. The only minor glitch with them is the crackling I hear every so often. It seems to be in the audio stream of the digital satellite broadcast. On other occasions, I can only hear from the right ear piece. Other than that they work great.<br /><br />JesseJ, Indiana"
R384TWVK669DXE,5,"The only thing bad I can say about it is that it doesn't cover the whole ear. But the over all sound is great, I love it."
R3W123W1FZ7Z5R,4,"Everything is great, the coverage, the tone, the ease of use, it just is a bit heavy and slips off my head easily."
R4B3RAOJNYGW7,4,"I gave the headphones 4 stars because they are exactly what I wanted for reception and range, BUT I seem to have received an item that was previously returned and had been broken.  I didn't return the headphones because I had waited 3 weeks before the package arrived and didn't want to suffer the wait again.  I had to resort to using super glue to stabilize a dangling ear piece.  I like the headphones, just terribly disappointed in amazon for shipping out a previously returned item without having inspected it for damages."
RX7N8YVGUK8E2,4,Overall I'm pleased with these headphones. I spent about a week looking at wireless headphones before I decided on this pair. I wanted to be able to watch tv and listen to music without waking my wife and son. She does ask me to turn them down from time to time. I guess they can get loud.<br /><br />I've been using them for about a month and have used them with multiple devices. I watch movies on my computer which is attached to my tv and they sound great. I also plug it directly into the tv which is the same. In my setup i use the one of the adapters. The Rca  to stereo.<br /><br />There are controls on the side for volume and frequency. I usually find that i have to manipulate the frequency a lot to eliminate static. I don't find it to be too big of an issue and only find it is necessary when i change rooms or initially turn them on.<br /><br />The distance is pretty decent as well. I live in a three story town home and the wireless base is on the second floor in my room. My place isn't huge but I was surprised to find that they work all over the house. This isn't really a need for me I was just curious. I do however listen to music with them frequently in the living room while my wife watches tv.<br /><br />The only issue and it's not a big deal to me is the head band which is a bit bulky. It is a bit wide at the top and looks wide on the top of your head. I would prefer the fit to be a bit more snug.<br /><br />I would recommend them. If i had a larger budget I probably would have purchased something a bit higher end. I would say that my needs were minimal and they fit them well.
R2SBFXJ8ZHKI3Z,1,"I should have focused more on the negative reviews for this product.<br />I just could not make these headphones work properly. Between the ever-present static<br />and the inability to ever get a clear signal (from 10 feet)they made me crazy.<br />I also didn't care much for the fit, not that it really mattered because the sound was intolerable.<br />Sent them back to Amazon and I'll keep looking."
R22NBO6SHQHP5X,5,"Bought this for my husband as a birthday present.  He loves it, ME TOO!  Because he has a hearing problem, we can now both watch TV at an acceptable volume.  I can also go to bed while he is still watching TV and not feel like WW 111 is going on outside my bedroom door.  He is happy that he can hear things he never could before especially when people are talking low.  One thing we cannot figure out is how he can watch a movie on the DVD player and use his headphones.  Iam sure there are splitters or we have it connected wrong.  A couple other people we know have the same problem."
R1SIJDSCZ8CF9H,4,Great product. I got one for Christmas and ordered a second one for my wife. Great if you have kids.
R3596FMS138RK1,5,Love this headphone. Can walk all over our house without losing reception. The most comfortable we have had. Real easy to charge- it just rests on the hook and hangs down over the charger and red light lets you know its working.
R3FXPC6IQYNGLJ,4,Works great first time out of the box. The only thing I would recomment to the Sennheiser is to make it a little snugger on the head. I would recommend this to anyone that has been using TV ears. TV ears tend to be a little bit uncomfortable after wearing for a couple of hours.
R2AUNY83HVVU06,4,"I withheld rating these until I had used them for several months.  I use them when mowing the lawn and doing yard work.  For me, the range without static is about 50 feet.  About 75 feet with mild static.  I have no problems with the battery life, recharging system, hook-up, weight, price, or shipping.  So why not 5 stars?  Well, I find the headphones a bit bulky and the fit bothers me.  There is no tension adjustment to make the fit tighter - so they tend to fall off if I look up or down.  I really think the company has good electronics but the body design could use some improvement."
R1PYX8BCGEUGDJ,5,"HeadPhones easy to set up. Has three channels, so,if one goes out can use another.  Currently have one set in great room that I bought 4 years ago. Now have the latest set in basement rec room.  Easy to adjust frequency and volume.  Head phones very comfortable.  Sound is excellent.  Acoustics in rooms very poor.  Can hear sounds that are obscure without headphones. Very easy to understand dramatic  dialogue with background music."
R896EE21U1SLJ,5,"I now have two of these. I have severe hearing loss in both ears, one is installed on my TV and one on my PC....<br />They are great!"
R2AXDWB4RUM8D0,4,"Reception and sound is very good. Nice that you don't have to plug in charger.  I would have preferred earpieces that surround the ear, however."
R3EIOS3XUWTK8X,5,"Purchased as a gift foer my son, he loves them as it allows him to watch TV late at night w/o disturbing anyone around him."
R17KB4GTG7DQZ4,5,"I purchased these wireless headphones because I'm on a one-year deployment to Afghanistan.  I'm sharing a room with three other guys, and while we have plywood walls separating our living areas, I wanted to be able to watch television and listen to music without disturbing them.<br /><br />Conveniently, the base for  these headphones can be set on a shelf or hung on a wall (hardware not included).  The audio and power cables are plenty long -- a good 6 feet or so each.  The set also comes with adapters so you can use it with RCA, 1/4 inch or 3.5 mm audio jacks.<br /><br />For the price, the sound quality on these headphones is excellent.  Whether watching TV, listening to music, or Skyping with my family, there are no background hisses or pops.  It sounds just like a set of headphones plugged directly into a device.  The only somewhat annoying feature these headphones have is that the transmitter shuts off after about 5 minutes of inactivity, so if your music stops playing and you forget you're wearing them, about 5 minutes later you'll get a sudden burst of static when the transmitter shuts off.  Not overly annoying, but if you were rocking out with your music turned up it can startle you quite a bit!<br /><br />I've had this set of headphones about 5 months now and they have held up perfectly.  I have noticed no undue wear and tear, and the battery life remains exceptional.  I watch 1-2 hours of television every night and Skype with my family for 20 minutes or so every day and find I charge these about once every week to 10 days."
R2PBHJ6KB9JZ6X,4,The sound quality of the Sennheiser RS120 is exceptional. Better than I hoped for in a wireless headphone. The only issue I have had is a popping sound when I get too close to the computer monitor. I would recommend these headphones.
RB4AF9LZP43AP,5,I wanted to buy some wireless headphones so I could watch TV in bed and not bother my wife. These headphones are crystal clear and connected easily to my TV. They are comfortable and don't fall off my head when I lay in bed and watch TV. They are well made and were less than any I found at stores like Best Buy. I would definitely recommend them.
RCZ3C7LA9ZCYK,4,"These were refurbished and a bit cheaper than the new version.  Sound quality is great.  I had a pair of Sennheiser headphones a couple of years ago that required expensive, special batteries.  These new ones take standard, rechargeable AAA batteries, a great improvement.  My one complaint is that I wish they had just a little more range.  I suspect the limited range is a factor of the low cost."
R24LU15LHYREPG,5,This is the third set of wireless headphones I've bought over the past 15 or so years.  I like these the best due to wireless charging which is working well so far.  Earlier headphones usually failed due to degradation of charging connection so I'm hopeful with these.
R2ELZRNN75D8LV,4,"Works perfectly for watching TV, just take it of the charging stand and switch on TV. Ear muffs ( on the ear) and head band are not very comfortable. Sound quality and WiFi range are resonable."
RM59XLICVY8H2,4,I am impressed with the quality of the sound that I get from this product.  I have long been troubled with being unable to understand what people are saying on TV and have tried different speaker systems with minimal success and have had to use hearing aids and the &#34;closed Caption&#34; feature to watch many shows.  This system has corrected all that.  I no longer wear hearing aids or used &#34;CC&#34; while watching TV and rarely have a problem hearing everything that is being said so it is worth every penny I paid for it.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is that the headphones fit so loosely that when i bend over they fall off my head  I have no problems with loosing the sound when going into other rooms in the house.
R1Q0AIGZVK33RU,5,Had my doubts but was very surprised. Had to buy a third party black box to hook up to my digital audio out on the TV.<br />The sound is so clear I could hear the cat purr on a movie I had seen twice and never knew he was purring.
R159GVZY6VC4JE,5,got them because my mom and dad could not hear the TV. I had to purchase an extra set of head phones but the smile on their face made it worth every penny. they work great and hold the charge really well.
R2WAUWKS6N47PA,2,"After using RS 130 and 140 headphones, one set was replaced by the RS 120 (other models no longer available).The RS 120 is compatible with current base station and does receive signal within limited range.  Sound quality much lower than other models.  Headset is flimsy and does not fit well over ears; slips off head if head lowered for any reason.  Would recommend RS 120 only if wanting to use with current 130 system and willing to accept lower quality product."
R1HPMKA8Q8HQWW,4,I wont' get too technical since I really need it so I can watch my favorite shows without causing any stress with my other half who is soooo sensitive to sound any louder than &#34;low&#34; . The headphones have better sound than my  Samsung tv so I am a happy camper!!
R34386DFJT66V5,5,"A marriage saving device. I can listen while my wife across the room can listen to her book on tapes without bothering her.<br />Also she can go to bed and doesn't have to be drowned out with the loud volume.<br />Also, unlike line of sight units, you can walk around the house and still hear everything..<br /><br />Another neat function, when you aren't using it you can set it on the cradle provided and it will charge your rechargable batteries.<br />I listen a lot during the day and it holds enough charge it doesn't run down, but, if you do, it is easy to put in new, fresh batteries"
R8AONHXSAOSJ4,5,"After reading many reviews, we ordered this one and it works very well, the sound is perfect. My wife is very happy."
R1V441JXQ8JPDF,3,"This was my first experience with wireless headphones so I don't have great comparision points, that said this is what I found.<br /><br />The reception is iffy sometimes I sit about 8 feet from the tv, the stand is next to the tv in a media cabinet which is sometimes not in line of sight, shifting my head around changes the reception.  It is generally good.<br /><br />Silent portions of movies/tv shows do not work well with these headphones instead of pushing the silence they think they lost signal and push static.  You do need to turn them off in the back during silent portions of tv watching or movie watching.<br /><br />You always need to make sure the source signal is at maximum and use the volume control on the headphones as little as possible to prevent a hiss that can develop.<br /><br />The on the ear design isn't the most comfortable - I might go for a wired set of headphones next and get an over the ear design.  I have been using these for a good amount of time now so I've definitely gotten my money's worth - they just aren't as ideal as I'd like them."
R27V17CU9LRJPX,2,"I bought this because of the astounding number of 5 star reviews; but after using it for three months I am mystified the product has received such a positive reaction. There are obvious problems that can be overlooked (falls off head if you look down, super loud hiss if no audio is played for two minutes, volume and tuning dial immediately next to each other) but the reason I'm writing this review is because people need to know the headphones carry a VERY intrusive automatic gain control.<br /><br />This manipulation of audio levels is extremely upsetting for me as it ruins the dynamics of music--songs that used to go from very soft to very loud are now just medium the whole way through. A handful of other reviews also indicate this; I wish I had read those before buying this product.<br /><br />On the plus side, the wireless is great and provides wonderful freedom (I wear a hat to prevent them from slipping off when I'm walking around), the audio quality (bass, treble, mids) is very good indeed, and the charging unit is super convenient.<br /><br />Again, I just can't believe that they have such an aggressive loudness equalization. It really ruins them for me.<br /><br />Also, I've got mine plugged into my desktop PC, and at max volume on the PC I still have to crank the dial on the headphones up for \\""louder\\"" than average volume--but this increase causes hiss/fuzz on the headphones. I would not recommend them for computer headphones because of this.<br /><br />Additionally, these are OPEN-AIR design. The \\""over-ear\\"" description made me think they would fit around my ears to block out outside noise, but they simply rest on top. There's a decent amount of noise leakage, so a nearby partner can definitely hear them. More importantly--you can hear everything outside of the headphones. If you're looking to block out the outside world, these headphones do not work. You'd need noise-cancelling headphones."
R70RCZEJ6YG4F,3,"I bought these headphones to replace my Sony RF970 that started clicking on/off.  The quality of this product was acceptable, but because of the design of the earpieces, they were very unconfortable to wear for more than an hour.  It really hurt my ears after watching TV for a couple of hours.  I have trouble hearing the TV and what is being said, so I really need headphone so I don't have to turn the TV volume way up disturbing the rest of the household.  I plan to return."
R2U702RYMTN4EV,5,"Because I have a loss of hearing, this improves my ability to understand the dialogue on TV without disturbing my neighbours in the adjoining apartments. Range and clarity are good. The only drawback I have found is that the fit of the headphones is a bit loose, so that the headphones can fall off if you look down at your feet."
RPDYA33HHOOKU,3,This is my scond Sennheiser wireless headphone set and while the first gave me a lot of years of use and pleasure this one has two faults.  One is that it will cut out momentarily for no reason and without warning every so often and two the headphones are not secure on my head.  If I lean forward slightly the fall off.  Except for the occassional cutting out or falling off teh sounf quality is very good.
R1OZKKM67T4TDD,5,it was a gift for my mother for Christmas. She started using it so she can sew and watch and hear the TV..
R3TB1NDFK052MF,5,"After checking out numerous other head sets my husband decided to purchase these. He now has two pair, one hooked to the tv at home and one to take with us for vacation. They work great! He says the sound is clear and he can hear very well. They are quite comfortable (not too heavy or hot around the ears) and the fit is very good. The wireless is a huge advantage, he can wear these as he grills dinner outside and still listen to his sports channels coming from inside the house. For me, it is great that he can turn up his volume as loud as necessary and it doesn't interfere with the sound coming from the TV so I can still control the remote and set it at the volume that I want. ....or I can mute it during football season!  :-)"
R2UWO1RN3TUY7Y,4,"this product wasn't easy to hook up to my tv and I had problems getting the sound to work correctly. If you lose electricity you have to reset them again, but they do help you hear the tv better if you want to wear them over your ears for a long period of time while you are watching tv"
R35QD7LUNGLXS7,5,"Comfortable, excellent sound, good charging station, lightweight, works all over the house and into the yard. No complaints, highly recommend."
R2LVA37H3PBIGM,4,"This headset has proven to be reliable and has good quality audio.<br />Charging the batteries merely requires dropping the headset on it's cradle.  Electrical contact is automatic and enhanced by magnetized cradle wires.  Nothing to plug in.<br /><br />Range is fairly good for all over our property, and real good inside.<br /><br />I guess about the only real complaint is that though very comfortable, the headset will easily come off with movements like bending over or fast moves of the head.  For normal use, this really isn't a problem.<br /><br />Good headset....highly recommended."
R226QV0DWL53UR,1,"I was looking for a good quality wireless headphone and I've bought this one because of the good reviews I've seen on Amazon. However nothing was good about this product.<br /><br />Terrible Noise:<br />I'm not talking about the noise outside. When I don't play anything I hear a hissing sound may be because of FM transmission. It sounds like I'm listening to a crappy old-fashioned radio.<br /><br />Tuning?<br />I wasn't expecting a tuner control on the headphone. It feels like you're putting a radio on top of your head. Actually that's my fault I haven't checked the description but this one uses Radio Frequency to transmit sound. I think there should be a better way for wireless sound transmission.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />The worst sound I've ever heard. My $7 in-ear headphones gives a better sound. Bass is strong, actually it is so strong that it sounds like phones are broken. May be the one I get was a really broken one I am not really sure about this.<br /><br />Overall, you can buy this one if you want to spend a lot money to a broken old-fashioned radio that looks like a headphone."
R1BB2Z4LIZIF99,5,"I bought 2 of these wireless headsets.  After 15 months, one of the transmitters became intermittent.  I figured it was out of warranty but checked online @ Sennheiser and the warranty was for 2 years.  I arranged the return online , was given a prepaid UPS label by Sennheiser , and their service department returned me a refurbished unit immeidately the same or next day.  With 6 days of UPS back and forth, I was operating again within  7 days.  Awesome product support--I'll buy Sennheiser again"
R39C9QXUW1J6RY,5,"We have two of these in the house (i.e. two base stations and two headset).  One base station is connected to the dvr.  The other base station is connected to a Mac.  We set up the base stations so that they transmit on different frequencies.  So two people can wear the two headsets and hear the same tv show, for example.  Or tune one headset to each source and hear different programs.  Our house is always quiet because we seldom play tv shows out loud."
R25EM5XLSV4CYN,5,"Lovely sound - particularly for music. Good value too if you get it for $75. Sometimes (on good friday) they hiked it to $100 for a couple of weeks. Not good policy, in my opinion. Greedy."
R7OXBKTCUM9QL,5,This is a great product my husband loves them. Easy to set up. Charging is just putting the headphones back on their stand what could be easier. The clarity is awesome as a car goes by on the tv you can here it in one ear then the other. Love them.
RBCSO4YIHHH9D,5,"IF YOU ARE HARD OF HEARING AND DON'T WANTTO WAKE THE HOUSE, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO. EARLIER VERSIONS MEANT YOU WENT THROUGH ALOT OF AAA BATTERIES."
R6E29TB9YYMHR,5,"Received this set of headphones last week for my husband to wear in bed for TV watching.  Easy to set up.  Clear sound, no static (it did take a few minutes of searching channels on headphones to get clear reception).  Comfortable on the head and ears."
RZRNVIRG81U6X,5,"Previous reviewers already mentioned the clarity of the sound, which is really outstanding on my opinion. It also does have a very nice range, so I can freely walk in my work office with headphones pretty far and still enjoy the nice reception. I am a software engineer and sometimes listening music is a distraction to me. If you will turn on your headphones with no music source attached to it than you can enjoy a white noise which is less distracting than a music to kill the sound of talking on phone or in person coworkers. No need to connect to mp3 player or online white noise generators. Very cool!"
RLW35GDO6YD97,5,Don't leave home without them.  In other words they are great.  My wife has good hearing and does not like the blair of the TV so I can sit back and have it on as loud as I like.  Also very clear reception.
R38RJ6XO4LUAX,5,So much better than my old one.  It is so much easier to tune and doesn't go out of tune as often.
RODJ6Q8PQQRNL,4,It works fine.  Took some fine-tuning to get a clear signal but that only took a few minutes and I was up and running.  I would recommend this model to friends.
R3CNM8PXISF631,5,We bought this for my dad who has started having hearing loss in the recent years. It was easy to set up and and easy for him to use. Great sound quality.
R3M3PK173J3LH5,4,"Placed next to the big-screen at the end of our bed .... this great product lets me nod-off with ease, as my wife continues her programming.  Easy to set-up, stays charged, very good sound quality .... what is not to like !!"
R1Y715RJX9SIMK,5,"I bought these as a Christmas present.  We plugged them in and they were working within 5 minutes!  Only bad thing so far is that when he hits pause, after a few minutes loud static is emitted.  Based on previous reviews I asked if they were comfortable and he says they are even with his glasses.  He uses them all of the time now even when no one is home!<br /><br />I highly recommend these headphones."
RLP56TMYB7NXB,1,"I don't like headphones that press on your ears.  These do.  It is impossible to tune them to perfect reception. There's always some background noise.  Also, the volume and tuning nob are RIGHT next to each other, so you inadvertently turn the wrong one and all of a sudden its screaming in your ears \\""AR-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.\\""  Very relaxing."
R2N4U4FJW25AJ,2,"I, like many others here, certainly do not understand the 5-star ratings.  Maybe those reviewers are not used to good sound or just don't appreciate great headphones or great music.  I spent a lot of time hoping to find wireless headphones at least nearly as good as wired, and am certainly disappointed.  I went with Sennheiser because I had their wired ones a number of years ago and remember them as pretty good.<br />  First, they are NOT &#34;over ear&#34; as I define that; i.e. they rest &#34;on&#34; the ear and do not surround your ear, fitting against your head like other &#34;over ear&#34; headphones I've had.  Therefore, they slip off my ears due to the weight when bending over even a little bit.  Also this gives no blocking of external room sounds.<br />  Second, I had to seriously tweak my equalizer to get any acceptable frequency balance when listening to music.  The response is very unlike my other speakers and headphones around the house, so I only use these with one laptop to not have to change my equalizers back and forth when going from speaker to headphones.<br />  Thirdly, the auto volume leveling just about destroys music that has a variety of volume levels that do a lot to make the music what it is.  Every time I'm expecting the nice punch from one level to another, like after a soft intro to a metal or symphonic number with great base and drums, the equalizer kicks in almost instantaneously and flattens it out to where it sounds like it's coming out of a cheap low powered radio.<br />  The auto-off feature, combined with the auto level control is absolutely teeth -grindingly annoying.  I often listen to news features while walking around doing random chores and if the sound goes off after what seems like no time at all, it cuts in with loud static.<br />  I had wanted to try wireless for a long time, but was wary because of reviews that say they're just nothing like wired.  They are very very handy for listening to the non-music things like news,etc while doing things all over the house.  The range is excellent, even out on the front/back porch or out to the garage, with little or no cutting out or fading.<br />  But for sound (music) quality, they're not even close to as good as a cheap pair I have for use with my Android music player, which I now exclusively use for music as these do not cut if for music.  Having tried them for about 5 weeks, I guess  I'll keep them for use with the laptop for news/videos/tutorials/etc. which I do a lot and is just not practical wired.  But the disappointment in sound quality for music, the irritating auto-off and auto-level control with no options to turn them off, the not very solid fit on my head or around my ears make these a 2-star at best."
R1QBVSVMXUZ4A4,5,I have been using this product for over a year and have purchased one for my mother who is also hard of hearing. I don't have to wear my hearing aids and can hear quite well. My wife can set the volume of the television at a level which is comfortable for her.
R3NXRL0SKERCQN,5,Purchased for my mother at Christmas so that she might be able to understand what was being said on her favorite television shows.  She loves them!  She can wear them from her bedroom to the kitchen and still hear clearly and she lives in a large home!  I highly recommend them!
REXSRSZIZ8RU6,1,"Operated per your instructions, but the unit just quite its operation.  Have not used in a long time.  I am a Homebound individual, thus getting it out to be repaired (if possible) is a difficult situation for me."
RFAMAK6JFOFJ9,5,"Works great for our intended purpose of muting tv sounds when I'm trying to sleep while my wife listens to Greta Van Sustern at night. Even with the jiggling you have to do to tune in to the Chanel's sound, this is a great piece of equipment."
R3PXALU4KTZM4Z,5,"Standard setting reception, audio reproduction quality and comfort factors, even from Sennheiser's entry level set.<br />I can't imagine what the high end products do better than this one."
R314JNUM01AJGU,5,Great reception with little or no static.  While the wife sleeps I can watch TV without waking her.  Simple to use and the charger works great!
R16A1CIC16R2WP,5,Great product if your hard of hearing.  I didnt realize how much music and background voices i was missing watching a moving until i started using these.  Very comfortable to wear.  Had a little difficulty setting up on my plasma tv but Sennheiser customer support was awesome.
RBG5FBL3ACKOO,4,"This is my 2nd wireless headphone. I love this fit ,I just wish it had more battery time when I charge it."
R3TLGUH879L9B,5,We bought 2 sets one for my wife and one for myself and we both like them. It is surprising how much extra you can here in the back round of things going on that you don't here on the TV.
R1G6R8V2WR4G8C,5,"Great item, we have a home theater system and Because of my hearing loss I was not able to enjoy it with the rest of my family.  When I received the headphones I was a little concerned about hooking them up as my theater amplifier did not have a audio out hookup.  After reading on line I became even more concerned as some suggestions were going to cost 25.00-100.00 and even one post said there was no way to hook them up to allow both the surrond sound speakers and headphones to work at the same time, which is true if you plug into headphone port on the front of the amp.  Not to worry though after a quick trip to our local electronis store  and the purchase of two splitter cables $9.00, no brainer hookup to the back of the TV and the family and myself are well satisfied. Would recommend to those who are hard of hearing or those that just wish to be able to listen to TV or music anywhere within the house."
R1EBLU6FLX1A9J,5,"My purchase was a birthday present for my Son.  It was indeed a surprise and since my wife and I each have a set we knew how good they are.  For us, living in a second home apartment in Denver with others around us they are perfect for noise reduction.  I appreciate your prompt dely and the price was good."
R39HKY8B2JHILA,5,"Super good product, I wear them in the same room but can roam to other rooms and still hear fine. These are super for being able to watch TV while others in the house want to go to sleep. Great investment."
R3HNU3PF13EDRU,5,Bought this for my husband so I didn't have to listen to hunting shows. Works great. He can wear headphones when a show he likes is on but I don't want to listen to it. Easy to wear and easy to charge.
R11E5ES7AGF4X8,2,"I gave these to my husband for Christmas so he could watch TV when others in the family were doing homework or I was reading.  Sadly, it turns out that they don't work with our television, so they are pretty much useless."
RSNFVKHDE06LO,5,My husband and I seem to disagree on the volume for the TV so a couple of years ago I purchased a set of headphones for Christmas.  What a great idea!  Now he can listen to the TV at max volume and I can either listen at a normal level or even mute the TV for some peace & quiet.  We loved them so much --purchased another set for the TV in the bedroom--yea!
R3DYG0NU3CH0R7,4,"Bought these a while back for a steal at $60. Work great in the bedroom. I initially had a problem with wireless interference but changing the channel fixed the issue. I could actually hear my neighbor on her cordless phone! No other interference problems.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great price.<br />Build endurance is great. (bought these back in 2009)<br />Charging is so easy. (no issues with battery life since purchase)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Feel a little bulky at times.<br />Extended periods of time are a pain on the ears. (as with MOST headphones)<br /><br />I ended up giving these to my mom recently and she loves them. For someone who doesn't need anything special, and something for basic listening then these are a great buy for ~60$."
R3E8TGSORQTREK,1,"Reviewing a product when you've only had it for a little while--and the honeymoon's still going on--is certainly valuable. Is it as advertised? Is it any good? How's the build quality? If I had written a review back in October of 2010 when I got these headphones, I might have given them 4 stars. TV rarely involves critical listening, so what if they were a little boomy? And so what if the earpieces have less padding than a Motel 6 mattress? They worked well enough for me. Well, not any more. After just two years and two months, they no longer hold a charge; they go for at most 45 minutes when the batteries are supposedly full. Not good enough. And BTW, it looks like they have almost doubled in price. I paid $58.20, and now they're close to a hundred. My advice?  Listen elsewhere."
RJNT5GNPNWGZ0,2,I sent the product back. My husband was not pleased with it. Not a clear sound. Music is real important to my husband.
R201FL89798833,5,excellent item and would recommend to anyone hearing impaired - it is all that was expected and has made tv much more enjoyable
R3KFZ9YRACBQO6,2,"Very comfortable, but a bit loose on head, if you lean forward t0hey often fall off. The sound quality is good, but I often have trouble getting a good signal (maybe some interference on my end). The worst part of these headphones is when the cpu is no longer sending a sound signal a loud static hiss starts, because the base unit has an auto-shutoff (which cannot be disabled). These are not a good set of headphones if you fall asleep."
RC3MZND53KHUG,4,This is the last in a long line of wireless headsets I've owned.  I really am impressed with the clarity and the range.  There is one con.  The earpads are a bit hard for long time wear and a tad too small to fit over the ear.  I took a set of softer and larger pads from an old set and now I couldn't be happier.
R6PR3XYB5UKS4,5,"I AM VERY HARD OF HEARING - THIS MEANS I BLAST MY WIFE OUT OF THE ROOM WITH THE TV WITH THE SOUND LEVEL HIGH ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR.  NOW I CAN SET MY OWN SOUND LEVEL AND MY WIFE CAN BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE TV SOUND LEVEL.  THE AUDIO QUALITY IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE.  I HAVE EXPENSIVE  HEARING AIDS AND THE EARPHONES ARE SO MUCH BETTER.  I HAVE NOT TRIED IT WITH MY STEREO SYSTEM SO HI FI QUALITY IS UNKNOWN, BUT BASED ON THE TV QUALITY I WOULD WAGER IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE:  THERE ARE TWO GAPS IN THE FOAM COVERING OF  THE HEADBANDS.  THESE GAPS MUST BE PLACED EXACTLY OVER THE CHARGE HOLDER FOR THE HEADPHONES TO CHARGE.  I MISSED THIS AND NOW I OWN TWO OF THEM.  OH WELL!"
R1YDLPI12F1NK0,5,"Sharing a small townhome with my TV loving husband used to mean it would never get quiet, except when we were sleeping.  I like peace and quiet at times and when he slips on his headphones I can relax.  He doesn't mind wearing them. They obviously make it easier for him to hear too.  His only complaint is they don't hug his head tightly enough for him to do light exercise, or even bend over for that matter.  Great sound quality!  Sennheiser is a great brand and worth every penny.  Easy to install and use.  The charging cradle is cool.  We are both happy he has them and we will never be without a headset again."
R11YXEXQVPM3LJ,5,"In the living room with the TV in the middle of the house, this product virtually creates a separate room for you from the rest of the people around the Room.  We got one connected to the computer and another to the tv in the same living space.  now we no longer bother each other as i watch my tv, and my daughter watches her youtube, and in the next room my wife making all the noise in the kitchen.  Btw, the quality is great too!"
R3UK6WG6YRYJOB,5,"I am 58 years old and I wear hearing aids for high-frequency hearing loss.  (Worked full-time at JFK during college 30+ years ago, five years ago started to lose my hearing.  High frequency hearing is basically nil.)  Even with $6,200 hearing aids, I still need the TV a little louder.  These are PERFECT for me.  May be a con for you, but a pro for me: They are loose on my head and will tend to fall off when looking down...BUT...I once had headphones that were so snug I couldn't use them.  Very comfortable, love the volume control, I wear with and without my hearing aids.  My entire family is also happy that we keep the volume for their comfort level.  Thanks so very much!!!!!  (I am almost crying....)<br />Marty"
R3OYC2BTNGZGPD,4,"In the short time of use so far, the headphones give clear sound and are comfortable to wear - even for long movies."
RI827MNK69IGE,5,"This is a great product for what I wanted.  Easy to set up.  I have seen criticisms of it for the weight (they are big but not burdensome for me, even for long periods of time) and the sound quality (yes as I walk around the house they buzz occasionally as the signal fades, but they have great range inside and all around the house and even outside the house) and how the headphones are not stable on the head (true, when being very active but fine with walking around) and for the auto cut-off and subsequent hiss (but I don't mind saving the batteries if there's no input...).  The sound quality is great for my needs- they are at least as good as my wired headphones.  One issue: The plug fits all my equipment snugly EXCEPT for my Mac- I have to fiddle to get proper stereo- I think this is my old Mac not the headphones."
ROUMGWDGTIFOA,5,the headset far exceeded my expectation...<br />work throughout the house beyond the specifications...<br />very comfortable to wear do the job...
R21VY85V7EGMPB,4,"Since my husband is extremely hard of hearing, and I have excellent hearing, when he watched the TV he would have the sound turned WAY up and it actually HURT my ears. I would wear EAR PLUGS to muffle the sound. Now he wears these nice headphones and we can turn the sound ALL the way off (actually MUTE the sound) while he can still hear the shows - or I can use the remote to turn up the sound to whatever level is right for me.<br /><br />The only think we do NOT like about these headphones is that the across-the-head top of the set is very WIDE with no way of adjusting it to get a snugger fit without fear of breaking/destroying it. The headphones fall off easily if my husband (or me - I tried them on too) look down... Otherwise, we love them and consider them to be a GOOD purchase."
R17L7LZJ715SDU,2,"Product has a two year warranty.  Save your receipt!  My receiver went out before the warranty would have expired.  If I had only saved the receipt or registered the product I could have gotten some help from the manufacturer.  Alas!  This is a replacement and I am registering it today!  I loved the original headphones, by far the best wireless headphones I have used. Just register your product or at least save your receipt!"
R3AEW2YWI0CF6T,3,"I do enjoy these ! The first set I had to send back did not work! BAD: The only problem I have is  I am engrossed  in a movie and  all of a sudden I have very loud static in my ear! WOW!! I jump and take them off and put them in the charger. So they last only so long. Good : I can hear the TV while I am in other rooms and also when I take the dog out. I just have to prepare myself for the loud screech!! Also my mother comes to visit and puts the TV on loudest setting and it is so loud I have to leave the room, she now wears the headphones and we both are happy!"
R14A2AYE4RXAJ9,2,"Man these hurt! And they are hot! I've had these since August 2010 and I don't like them. Yes, the sound is good, no question. But so what. This headset is hot to wear and painful. After wearing these for an hour, my ears are on fire and my head and ears are killing me. I've tried adjusting the headset but it doesn't make any difference. The headset I had before this was the type that fits behind the ear and goes around the back of your head. Those were smaller, cooler and more lightweight. However the sound wasn't as good and you couldn't lean back against your pillows if you were watching tv in bed. I mostly wear the Sennheiser headset while I'm in the kitchen. I have to take breaks and take them off my head because they are so uncomfortable. I will say the range on this thing is CRAZY GOOD! I wore these outside and started walking down the street and could still get reception. Never been able to do that with another headset."
RUPKXGBWOE57W,4,"The reviews where people couldnt get the hissing to go away isn't the case for all of them. The one I recieved is touchy but there is definitely a sweet spot that takes some finesse to reach where there is no hiss. The one down side is that if nothing is playing through them for a little while they shut off and it  blasts static in my ears, so that is unfortunate. I can go anywhere in my house and have music playing clearly which is pretty incredible to me because my house isn't small. I have another pair of this brand of headphones (the HD 280 Pro) and if you don't mind being attatched to what your in front of they are the way to go (better sound quality, noise cancelling and a bit more secure on your head, and the same price) but the freedom these headphones provide is great. Having more freedom should be the main reason you bought these over the HD 280 Pro's because the 280 Pro headphones are just all around better than the wireless and anyone who loves their music and doesn't need to move much when they listen or while watching movies or playing games while the girlfriend is asleep and wants it to be quiet, the HD 280 Pro headphones are a better choice. Good thing they just the same."
R398WESRYMXEXT,3,"There are not many choices out there for wireless headphones at a decent price. I shy away from all Sony products as my luck with them in recent years has been bad but your mileage with Sony may vary. I already had a set of Senheisers 180 phones in the $300 range which are great for music listening however the 120s have issues.<br /><br />First, you have to 'position your head like an antenna\\"" to find the spot where there is no hums or hisses...you cannot be located near a tv or computer screen or you get a LOT of hum. When you find the right spot, the hum does go away, but you may be standing on your head at that point. After a few minutes, you then need to find a new position...pain in the butt.<br /><br />The other reveiwers noted that after a certain amount of time (a minute or 2) the transmitter shuts off and you are BLASTED and I MEAN BLASTED!! with white noise. Depending on your volume setting this may make your head explode. This can happen if you have the music off and you are looking for a particular CD to listen to..a few minutes go by and BANG!!!!!!!!  Blows your head right off. These other reviewers are NOT making this up. After the first time this happens to you, you WILL BELIEVE!<br /><br />I have a home studio using pro tools etc...and I bought these to monitor my tracking (these would be HORRIBLE for mixing..do not try this at home!)...but just for monitoring tracks and not having to deal with the headphone cable while you are playing, these work ok....as long as you take them off your head between takes..otherwise LOOK OUT for the shut off!<br />For listening and enjoying music, between the buzzing, humming and stress of the transmitter shut off between songs or cds, i would not recommend these. The 180s have NONE of these issues and stay solid, clear and do not have the shut off issue..and for this the price is triple. That's the reason..but its worth it for me."
R2BD5Y86EP7ZTI,4,"Our previous pair of wireless headphones (different brand) lasted about 4 years.  Since we have moved into a 2-story place a few months ago, the old headphones had a lot of static when we went upstairs.  When they broke, we got these, and there is a huge difference in the range.  I love that I can be upstairs and the sound from the TV is crystal clear.  They don't cup around the ears, so when you look down or up, they sometimes slip or fall off.  They fit comfortably and aren't too heavy.  The charging cradle is a nice design and takes up less space than our old one.  This will be a good purchase if they last as long as the old ones!"
R3APSY1F6IV83U,2,"These are comfortable, have a reasonable sound quality for the price, but they are extremely leaky. The sound leak is so bad I might as well have my computer speakers on low to the whole room. Unusable for the office, they have to go back."
R1BLR3B61QADA1,1,This product has too many flaws! The worst being that you could easily hear people talk while you have them on!
R2QQ9XX1SNNWQH,5,I bought two of the RS120's as gifts for my adult sons and they both love them.  One son had a pair of another brand and he said these were far superior.
R3FKR799SGQWSC,5,My husband is very happy with how these sound.  He uses them all the time now so we don't have to crank up the volume on the tv but he can have as much volume as he wants.
R2EZ37ONDRVU8C,5,"These have a good sound and are comfortable, also. Some others are too heavy. I would definitely suggest that others would try them."
R2HZX5EIDWJDSL,5,"Just like almost everyone else stated here it is a great product: great sound quality, charge lasts long time, easy to hook up,comfortable, inexpensive (considering it is wireless and has a rechargeble base.)<br />Charge lasts forever and I watch my British shows every evening, sometime I forget to put it back on the charger and it's fine the next evening. I've been using them for a month and no issues whatsoever, just great product.<br />I sometime do dishes with the headphones on or go to a different room and there is no change in sound quality. Although they look big they are surprisingly comfortable. Try it, you'll enjoy it. For $99 such a great product, i'm surprised."
RARS73VBGGHQX,5,"I tried another type wireless headphones... (Sennheiser IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive Listening Stereo Headphone System) no comparison to what I have this this product!  (Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle) As my wife is somewhat disabled, WiFi is so much better then the (LOS) line-of-sight between the headset & earset,,,  the other had."
R35BBOS6U1CZ28,1,"It did not work for me.<br />Experience was good  until first attempt to charge headphones.<br />All attempts to put book on top , change angle , etc, did not give positive result."
R2H69V3WTYRK9W,5,"I am probably the worst kind of reviewer for the sellers on here, because I rarely write reviews for things I buy that turn out as expected.  I'm most likely to write one when a product has a flaw that others should be aware of.  However these Sennheiser headphones are so awesome that I just wanted to write something for people who wonder if they work and worth the money.<br /><br />I received these as a Christmas gift in 2010 (I'm writing this 1/23/13).  There are a few news shows I like to watch in the evening, but other duties (chores) are always calling for my attention.  When I opened these I was immediately excited because they would allow me to listen to my shows and still get things done around the house.  Obviously I cannot see the picture, but most of the time I don't need to.  I feel so much more productive because I am no longer tempted to become a couch potato and sit in front of the TV.<br /><br />I was skeptical when just reading the box, but I hoped for the best and connected it to my TV.  Connecting is very simple too.  I tuned into one of my shows and headed out the door to do some yard work.<br /><br />I was shocked!  The stereo sound was much better than the television itself.  The volume is adjustable on the headset and will go so loud I can even hear when riding the lawn tractor.  Not exaggerating.  I do it often.<br /><br />The ad said it would transmit up to 300 feet.  I have learned to take those types of claims with a grain of salt.  Similar products say 150 feet and that sounded more likely.  We have a big yard and you can get about 350 feet away from the house and still be in our yard.  So after hearing how nice the sound was, I headed for a walk to see how far I could go and still get reception<br /><br />Again, I was shocked.  I walked past the pond, past the garage and walked down a slight hill toward the back of the yard.  I had perfect reception until the last few yards when it started to break up and heard static.  However, that distance was way more than I would need on a regular basis.<br /><br />I use it every day.  Fully charged the batteries will last about 2 days, but I suggest getting into the habit of putting it on the charger every night.  You just have to set it on the cradle and it connects to the charger automatically.  I had to replace the rechargeable batteries after about a year.<br /><br />In all fairness I could not give them less than 5 stars for this, but the only improvement I would suggest is to make them fit tighter to your head.  This thingy is ideal for multitasking and if your life is anything like mine that includes many tasks that require bending over.  You need to bend over slowly or risk flinging them off your head.  I'm not reducing my review score for this though because I don't really see it as a flaw as much as a practical limitation of the spring tension of headsets in general.  They are tighter than most lower-end headsets.  I'm thinking of getting one of those straps you can use to hold eyeglasses around your neck. I'm thinking I can put that around the back of my head to prevent them from sliding forward when bending over. I might update this review if that works.<br /><br />I can also add that the ear pads are really comfy.  I have felt better on really high end headphones, but these are very good.  They actually help keep my ears warm during the winter months.<br /><br />I'm not a plant for the company or a professional reviewer.  I'm just a regular 50-year-old guy that found an extremely practical product that far exceeded my expectations and I thought you should know."
R2W7NWGGXK9UW4,5,"My wife's hearing is fading and she needs to run the TV a lot louder than is comfortable for the rest of the family, so I bought the RS120 for her for Christmas.  She is delighted with the headset.  She finds it comfortable to wear and the sound is great.  I bought an extension audio cable so that the cradle can set on the side table next to her chair which makes it convenient to use and easy to put the headset back on the charging cradle when she is thorugh with it.  I would defintely recomend the RS120 to anyone who wants a good, reasonably priced wireless headset."
R28UN7EJY9PIIA,5,"No more headaches listening the wife saying turn the tv down. I can watch and hear what I want and when I want. Love it cause when using it and the wife is talking, I point to the head set showing her I can't hear her."
R7DSPTHWY6VRG,5,"I love the headphones. I have a huge hearing lose and tinnitus in both ears due to working in a very noisy factory for over 14 years. My wife hears the television comfortably on 20. I need 35 to 40. With these headphones ,I have my 40 and she has her 20. A happy wife is a happy life."
R10EG8CETPO1AD,5,"Excellent quality, easy set-up, arrived very fast! No static.  I prefer to use these while I watch tv than without them now!"
R12HN7SK9J95MX,5,"These headphones have an unbelieveable sound quality.  I bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  Not only do they block out other sounds when he's watching TV, but I can turn the TV volume down so it's a comfortable level for me as well."
R3FFGPZTM4R04D,5,Fantastic!  From the first hook up the sound was great.  Good base.  Excellent at all levels.  Would recommend it to friends.
R2B1WC3XSJ4MFU,1,Unit is nice looking and comfortable.<br /><br />My main use was to not wake wife up at night.<br />Unit is easy to setup . However my main<br />issue is the volume does not go high.<br /><br />I have several Ipods and Ipads-Volume is not an issue.<br />I had the headphones hooked up directly to my Dish Hopper.<br />No issues with Hookup-very straightforward.<br /><br />Not a good product. Move on.
R2CZ6XPIDU2OGL,5,"Helps greatly in understanding what many actors mumble. If I need to leave the room for a moment, I don't have to pause the program, I can continue to listen even if I am outside tending the grill. Works great for us."
R1B3BCLUAVK81K,4,"Great sound and works pretty much anywhere in the house. I have not needed to recharge the batteries yet, and having NiMH batteries save the inconvenience of recharging. The only con so far has been the need to re-tune occasionally."
R34I9MCETT6288,5,"My wife uses them daily and she loves them.  Good product, well built and convient.  Easily changed with the supplied unit"
RN2I3810EBFQH,5,"Bought this for my husband as he has a hard time hearing the tv, while the rest of us wish he would turn it down some. These have worked out great!!! Have exceeded my expectations.<br />My husband was sceptical at first but now he enjoys them and he is no longer being nagged to turn the tv down."
R1BN4N8DQSUBOX,5,"My grandmother used to have some headphones for her tv so that she could hear what was going on without making my uncle and grandfather go deaf in the process.  I was afraid that these would be much like hers in that with hers you have to have some volume on the tv to be able to hear anything through the headphones.  I wanted to be able to have the tv volume all the way down and still be able to hear through the headphones and these were exactly what I was looking for.  The sound is very clear through these headphones and the tv can be as quiet as it needs to be while I'm able to get the perfect sound quality and volume to be able to hear well.  An excellent choice, both in quality and price.  I recommend this product to anyone that has difficulty hearing the tv but lives with people not so hard of hearing.  Great product!"
R2J7BHA78NZF2I,4,Got this for our son so he didn't disturb anyone while watching TV at night.  Haven't heard how he likes it.  I'm assuming he does...he is quick to let me know if something isn't quite to his liking or doesn't work as he thought it would (Haven't heard anything negative )
R3AXCUVUYKT2ME,5,"good customer service. good product, good customer service. good product, good customer service. good product,good ,good customer service. good productcustomer service. good product"
R2L9YLU20AM8CN,4,They sound great but occasionally (rare) radio signal weakens. But I'm still learning all the best settings and how they work.
RLQRZJRX2XWP4,3,"I bought my RS120 wireless headphones in 2006.  For the first two or three years, I was delighted with them.<br /><br />But then the volume control on the headset started to get flaky.  It made scratchy noises when I changed the volume, and -- worse -- no longer responded linearly to turning the dial.  It got harder and harder to listen at low volume, and the left ear dropped out entirely.  It finally got to the point where I could only listen by turning the dial to much higher volume than I wanted and then positioning the earpiece well away from my ear to make the volume bearable.<br /><br />Should I simply replace the headset?  The headset is available for separate purchase (model HDR120), but disappointingly the price is only a few dollars less than the price of the entire set, so I have to ask myself what's the point.<br /><br />I want to respond to a few criticisms that other reviewers have had.  Many have complained of the jarring static noise that the phones produce when the transmitter turns off (as it does automatically after three minutes receiving no signal).  I found this annoying at first, but eventually got used to it and learned to quickly flick off the switch on the headphone as soon it happened.  In the end, it was not a big problem.<br /><br />Others have complained of the phones falling off the head too easily.  I also had this problem, particularly when I would lean over to pick something up.  But there is an easy solution.  I just strung together a couple of rubber bands, forming an elastic strap that I attached just above the earphone on either side.  Whenever I put the phones on my head, I put this elastic strap around the back of my head.  The strap prevents the phones from falling off when I lean forward.  (Pony-tail style rubber bands are most comfortable for this purpose.)  I honestly can't figure out why Sennheiser doesn't provide such an elastic strap as a standard part of the equipment.<br /><br />One thing that attracted me to this product is that it uses easily replaceable standard AAA rechargeable batteries.  I am happy to report that in six years of use I have never had to replace the original batteries.  By contrast, the Radio Shack phones that this set replaced had a non-standard battery that had to be special ordered from Radio Shack, a big inconvenience.  But - in view of the problems reported above, I have now gone back to using the old Radio Shack phones."
RZXKIAIX3Y2IS,5,"These Sennheiser wireless headphones are excellent. The range, clarity and ease of use are exactly what works well with my 55&#34; 3D Plasma TV. I would definitely purchase Sennheiser products again."
R10U2742LGF4S7,5,"Bought the headphones for my wife.  She uses them to listen to the TV at night so I can turn off the sound and sleep peacefully.  For this, I love them!"
R12NGFL5UEX23U,5,"Minimal  frequency disturbance , comfortable wearing  without too much pressure even after many hours.<br />Would highly recoomend.<br />Durable, like the charger /storage"
R2I619JRTDSAEN,4,"Due to work related hearing damage which is not bad enough for a hearing aid, hearing tv was difficult. These headphones change that. I can hear a little hiss occasionally which might mean an average listener could hear more. I love the base charging station. Have watched full length movie, headphones were comfortable and had sufficient charge."
RG5HG41YKZE1K,5,"I bought the Sennheiser model HR120 3 years ago for the living room TV. and I'm looking to buy another Seenheiser model for the master bedroom.  In a nutshell, they have worked flalessly all this time.  Absolutely no problems and the clarity is really unbelieveable for a low-priced cordless headset.  I'm a older guy and my left ear hearing isn't what it used to be so my wife loves me when I put them on so she can watch TV in the kitchen.  I've walked to the front yard with them on and they still work fine.  I don't think you can beat these so guys, get them and let your wife sleep."
R2JB5EYV22LGES,5,These ear phones are the best I have every had.  I can now hear the tv and not blast my wife out of the house. She likes them vey much.
R22X6EJLLRHLIT,3,Best quality for the cheapest price I could find.  Not real comfortable.  The sound is decent by the volume adjust doesn't work so great.
R2R6QVXEUS8TVN,5,"I love these headphones. I've had them for a little over four years now and they still work perfectly. The sound quality is great and the batteries still hold more than decent charge. The wireless range is amazing--I easily go out, go down from my third floor apartment and about 100 or so feet away to throw away the trash and I can still hear my music/TV with little interference at that distance! This is a great product well worth the money if you want wireless headphones."
R2K9UZA6L462V0,4,"Bought these for my Dad for Christmas so he can hear the TV again and he absolutely loves them and uses them all the time. Hasn't complained about them being uncomfortable or anything. I listened for a while and they sound quite good. No idea about life of the battery or any long term issues since it's only been a month but so far, I'm impressed by them."
R1CG7D4C0LA7OV,5,"I bought these for my husband, who is over 70, with some hearing loss.  He can hear the tv much better with these headphones.  We have a flat screen HD tv with the speakers in back, so we have to turn the sound up to hear.  Wearing these headphones, I can hear every nuance of the sound whispered directly in my ears.  When my husband puts them on, his eyes light up and he laughs at all the jokes, so I know he can hear them.  The range is wide, you can still hear the tv sound out in the garage.  Very clear sound; I may buy some for myself!"
RVRNDTWS4Y307,5,"Works great with TV.  Very clear, no static even when walking around. My significant other always wants the TV louder than I do, so it makes both of us happy.  Also, you can mute the TV with no affect on the headphones.  Would reccomend to a friend."
RDLY3CABYQ5RK,5,Works great and the range is great. My wife uses this while on our treadmill and I'm asleep. She can turn the volume to her level and I never hear a thing.
R383CPBI021TFR,2,"I have had this unit for 5 years in my house and have had no problems with it, ever. I decided to get one for my 92 year old father after he tried mine. Ordered the product and all was fine for the first 2 weeks then the tune wheel became hard to adjust and made the left side impossible to hear out of. Went online to Sennheiser 2 weeks ago and filled out their tech support page. To this day I have had no response, so the head phones sit idle. I would have called Amazon but from past experiences I would have been tolld to contact Sennheiser. Its a good product but not this one. 2 STARS"
R1O3QK83WT6PMD,5,"We brought these for my husband who is has become hard of hearing. These work perfectly and make TV watching so much better for the two of us. We no longer have to keep the volume up  so loud that it was unbearable for me. The sound is unbelievable and on some older shows, it actually improves the sound quality"
R2N0QS2WY6BXGM,4,I Have been using it since I got it.. great sound quality. A little loose fitting on my head.. but sound quality - particularly surround sound effect -- is impressive.<br />Note that this is an open air model so a person next you will hear some noise..<br />Recommended to night movie watchers (in the family room or the basement though.. :)
R3AM2D5TDX2MA1,5,"My husband discovered these several years ago and we purchased our first headset.  We enjoyed it so much we bought two more for other TVs in the house.  I've seen much cheaper models that require constant changing of batteries.  We especially like the cordless convenience and the charger relieves us of the task of replacing batteries.  We simply replace the headphones on the charger overnight and we've never had a dead battery.  They are so comfortable I sometimes forget I have them on.  Our children grew up with them and as they moved out, we gifted each of them with their own new set.  In the living room, one person can watch TV without the background noise of the rest of the family in the room.  Someone talking on the phone can be free of the noise of the TV, while the person viewing is free of the phone conversation.  In the bedroom I can watch late into the night while my husband sleeps beside me.  My daughter listens while her husband is working at home.  Plus I can move all around doing my housework without missing a thing.  We all love these headsets and can't imagine enjoying TV without them."
R11APT6VA9QBZ8,4,"i WOULD GIVE THIS FIVE STARS EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ON SOME OCCASIONS THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STATIC.  FOR THE MOST PART, IT DOES MAKE MY TV VIEWING MORE ENJOYABLE IN THAT I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE DIALOGUE."
RW46H3XVGQI42,5,"They work awesome!  Sound quality and reception are outstanding.  It's nice to hear the TV or stereo while checking the mail, walking anywhere in the house or garage.  I mute the TV and use them every night after everyone goes to bed. Just turn them off and put them on the charging stand when your done and they'll be charged and ready for he next day.  Worth every penny!"
R1PK0KGEMLBBK7,5,Works great.  Got them for my husband and he loves them.  Now he can hear dialog on TV without having sound at highest volumn.  I love that!!
RY8ESPBT1K5EZ,4,"I got these to use at work, where i am frequently away from my desk, working at a light table. They performed flawlessly. I've even worn them down into the warehouse, and the signal remained strong. I mainly use them for listening to Howard Stern and other talk radio, so i don't know if they've putting out audiophile fidelity. But don't distort and they're comfortable to wear all day."
R3FFVRED346I40,5,What a good eiver...... A good value for the money. I bought a second pair to use with my Ham radio receiver.
R1A1B6TJ62CQ94,5,"My husband can watch tv in the living room and I don't have to listen to it in the kitchen, 2 rooms away!  Quietness & peacefulness has returned to our household....."
R3ENXXYWF2AV61,5,My husband wears these at home so he can hear and understand the shows better on TV. We had a pair in one room for many years and he wore them all the time. We needed another pair in another room that had a seperate receiver for the TV. I ordered the same ones he had since we had such good luck with these. We have had the original ones for 7 or 8 years and still using the same rechargeable batteries in them. Highly recommend them.
RK20HXSE84TR2,4,"Only drawback for me was that the headset now uses a flat foam product which doesn't block out the ambient noise as well as the rubber cupped earphones on an older version that I had borrowed to test the quality.  Other than that they serve the purpose well.  Now that I know the style of earphone, I would probably still purchase it due to the overall quality of the experience with the Sennheiser."
R1YJIXO6N0IW9S,5,"Excellent design and quality built.  You can use it in the home or charge it up and take it out to use.  My son in law loves it and uses it all the time, keeps exterior noise out as well."
R30GYVX2F5ZRCV,5,"This is the third purchase I have made for this headphone. I have helped relatives with purchasing this headphone for their use.  I did my research and just felt this was the best one for the money. The only regret is that the price has jumped up considerably since my first purchase of one.<br /><br />You can go outside, downstairs, down in the basement, etc. and still hear the sound as clear as if you were in the room with the television.<br /><br />Good Product!"
R35AXOVYOOX1BN,4,It was a gift to my mother on christmas day for nite time use and we had to buy a new tv cuz it would not work without specific jacks
R34AXBG3UMXC1U,5,"I bought them for my husband who has trouble hearing what people are saying on the television.  He turns the volume up and I cover my ears and say &#34;it's too loud&#34;.  But now with his new tv ears, he can control the volume for himself and I can enjoy watching a movie without having my ears being blasted!  I highly recommend them."
RHC5D25060B0X,5,"This is the second set Sennheiser headphones we have had. This set was easy to set up, plugged in and were ready to go after charging the batteries. No fiddling with tuning or anything."
R39PCMHTVYU3OQ,4,"I bought this headphone set for my mother-in-law, who is moving into an Assisted Living Facility.  She is almost deaf and with poor eyesight.  I didn't know if she was going to like wearing headphones at age 96 but, to my surprise, she LOVES these.  For the first time in well over a year, she can comfortably sit and hear the TV without having it blarring at maximun volume and driving everyone else out of their minds.  I would have scored this set 5 stars except for one thing, that's probably no trouble for most peoplem and that is the TUNE wheel, which is located just below the VOLUME control on the right headpiece.  Her little arthritic fingers have a problem finding those wheels and, if she inadvertently moves the Tune wheel, she loses video and has to have someone help her get it back.  Other than that, they are really GREAT."
R35765LNZTJ9G1,5,"Better than expected. Great sound, comfortable on head. Easy set up and wish I would had bought sooner than I did."
R3THJ78N5CGOXK,5,"I use these for watching TV while my family is asleep. They work great. Convenient charging, great sound, long range. Absolutely no complaints. I haven't experienced any interference that others have mentioned. They are superb!"
R1SZ793O04ZRGL,5,"Hooked them up with a really small amp through the preout on the back of our main amp so my husband can hear  TV the without blasting me out. The hook up was a little tricky but works great. The sound quality is good and my husband is really happy with them so far<br /><br />Feb 2016-We're still using these headphones for the TV. They've been a life saver. They occasionally loose the Bluetooth connection, but it really is pretty rate. I would buy them again."
R2LZFVDCBA8B35,2,"I have tried several different devise's, but all have static as this one did.  I sent it back, I'm not sure if it's the devise or my TV.."
R1KNF0OIERFRXV,1,Was my first try at a wireless and it was bloody awful. There exist a lot of noise even after hours of charging and tuning.
R1XCIFQ7RGM2X,1,"Thought this set of headphones was great when I got them last Xmas (2011).  However, that was short lived.  After only a few months it started generating a large annoying amount of static crackling every time I move the little volume adjust dial on the front of the right ear phone.  Some of it goes away after I take my finger off the dial, but more often than not a somewhat reduced but still intolerable volume of the static noise remains, which of course makes the listening experience far less than acceptable.  More than likely this another consequence of off shoring to cheap Chinese production that we USA consumers are forced to bear.  Don't buy this product because it apparently cheaply made and poor quality.  Best to find another higher quality product from another manufacturer."
R3VNY1P4KA5YJ,3,"The headset looks good and has good sound quality, but battery charge does not last very long.  There is some static initially noticed.  Limited distance range from the base."
RM877W9YRCS23,4,"Bought these for my wife.  Her only complaint is that they are a little large for her, and would be nice if they had a snugger adjustment.  Otherwise happy with them, good sound, easy to set up and tune."
R3IZP8M8LZMX1C,2,"When these headphones work, they're alright but not great. Sound quality is middling at best, but there is little to no bass and they tend to be quiet. Unfortunately, the convenience of wireless headphones is counterbalanced by the serious problems with the product. If you live in any area with other people and other wireless signals, you will experience a large amount of interference, and that interference is LOUD. More than once I've been left with headphones on the other side of the room and two ringing ears. Also, when no signal is sent to the headphones for around 60 seconds, the headphones will automatically turn off. Instead of silence, however, the headphones will play the LOUDEST static I've ever heard. I can hear from across the house when I've forgotten to turn the headset off.<br /><br />If you can constantly put a sound source into the headphones and avoid the extremely sensitive interference, they're good for the price. Unfortunately, having to deal with an incredibly loud burst of static every 30 seconds due to either interference or the automatic shutoff of the base cancel any kind of long time enjoyment to be found."
RBXFIGO6LQVX8,4,It's works great when either of us want to watch tv while the other sleeps.  Great sound quality and no leakage so that the person sleeping next to you will not be disturbed.
R21H1SDY6G8NGX,4,"I got these to sit on my desk at work because I work in cubicle land and I find noise to be very distracting. I actually don't use them as often as I thought I would, but it's not because there's anything wrong with the headphones. They work quite well.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good, though there is occasionally some static that has to be dealt with by moving the base a little. I'm typically very annoyed by these sorts of things, but the issue is so minor and infrequent with these headphones that I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I've had these for two years or so and the betteries still seem to hold a charge very well. I'd buy these headphones again."
R2IXN3V8YVBU21,5,"Work great, leave the house quite and still enjoy a good movie.  Works well with films were dialogue is difficult to understand."
R220LMZX2UP04W,5,My dad was getting complaints from neighbours for his loud TV - he finally started using the earphones i bought him and sent me a thank you card; he mentioned that the sound was much better and more concentrated.
R36ZDCWMEQF8VS,2,"The headphones sound great, as one might expect from Sennheiser; unfortunately, they are very uncomfortable to wear, and do not stay on the head very well.  They are also somewhat heavy, so if you tilt them back to get the weight of the band off of the crown of your head, they fall off immediately.  There is no horizontal sizing mechanism, so unless your head is somewhat wide, you will not enjoy them."
R1XT2RQAP4TMWP,5,"This device, once I figured out how to properly install it, is exactly what I needed.  I can hear the TV dialogue!  I don't need to be in front of the TV to do so and, in fact, can walk from the basement TV area to the second floor and still hear clearly.  The device is easy to use and extremely easy to charge.<br /><br />If I had a complaint, it is that the on/off switch is too small for easily manipulation -- I'm older, as I suspect are a substantial number of users -- as is the volume knob.  Moreover, it would aid if the volume knob and frequency tuning knob were easily distinguishable to the touch.  Yes, I know that the volume is on top and the tuner is on bottom, but bigger knobs with distinctively different feel would be an improvement."
R2JE9AAUR034AZ,5,"Wife says much more comfortable than TV Ears and better sound. We have big screen TV with 7.1 surround sound. Wife has trouble hearing voices due to background sounds. TV Ears work well, isolates voice... but are uncomfortable after wearing for a while. Got these wireless headphones on discount at a local store. She loves them. Says sound is fuller than the TV Ears and voices easy to understand. Although only 2 channel, she says sound feels more surround than the Ears. Plus she says they are very comfortable for longer listening. They are flat against your ear with minimal pressure - doesn't go over ear or in the ear. So far no problems staying on as some reviewers mentioned. They are adjustable. She was also impressed that when she got up to go to the kitchen to get a snack, that she didn't miss any dialogue. Signal went through walls without any static.<br /><br />Before, I would have to turn the volume up for her to hear voices, and then turn it down during loud periods (explosions, etc.). Now I can set it at a normal level for me to hear voices and where loud parts aren't too loud. I also notice that she can hear me when I talk to her. When she wore the TV Ears, because they go inside of ear, she would have to remove from head in order to hear me -- made watching shows & movies less interactive.<br /><br />The transmitter stand can be positioned almost anywhere. The rechargeable headset rests on metal rack above transmitter. Very easy to set on rack and see the red charging light come on to verify they are charging. The TV Ears are a little more temperamental -- you place them in a charger and unless they are positioned just right to make contact with charger they won't charge. We often have to fidget with the Ears until the green charging light comes on.<br /><br />My grandson recommended these to me and said his in-laws use them and love them. Glad he did. These are keepers. They do go on special now and then for around $70 which makes them a definite buy if you see them at that price!"
R3CLISEBAW6VAT,5,The item is fine and but I was supposed to get recharable batteries with this and they were not in the box.  Not happy.
R280JDFP82N308,5,"Bought for my Dad because he is hard of hearing, to help him hear the TV.  These are way better than most of the ones you find in dept stores, etc.  Well made, easy to use and charge in their cradle automatically when you just hang them there.  Highly recommend."
R3QK8WPK3DEJKC,5,"I bought my first one of these to keep my wife from complaining that the television was too loud, late at night, when she was trying to sleep.  And it was too loud, because my hearing nowadays isn't what it was when I was younger.  That was several years ago.  Now my wife is happy, and I'm happy because I can listen to movies on television at a decent volume without worrying about offending my wife's sensitive ears.  I wear these while cooking in the kitchen, on the exercise machine, mowing the lawn outside, in my workshop, basically anywhere in or around the house, and I still get good reception and I can keep up with the television program I was watching.  The headset gets a little loose after a year or so of wear, and it (they) have a tendency to fall off when you lean forward.  I solved the latter problem by making an nearly invisible \\""loop\\"" out of black nylon fishline that goes behind my head to prevent the headphones from falling off, regardless how far I bend over.  The ear cups are large and well-padded to deaden outside sounds.  Because they're on my head and the television volume is low or off, I just flip the on/off switch to \\""cut\\"" commercials wherever I am, then flip it back on again when the commercial is over.  Often, I forget about the tv altogether and leave the switch off, and I find the headphones can be used effectively to just deaden ambient noise and isolate me from the environment while reading or when I need to concentrate.  They're that comfortable.  Before long, you don't know you're wearing them.  The best part is that Sennheiser sells (through Amazon) replacement headphones, so you can keep one headphone on the charger while wearing the the second headset, so you always have full power.  Often (like Saturdays) I'll wear the headphones nearly all day, which means I get 8 to 10 hours of continuous use on a charge.  The on/off switch itself is the only problem I found with these headphones.  I've had three (3) headsets.  One died of switch failure well after the warranty period, and a second pair is getting that way after about two years of heavy use.  I recently bought the third headset, so I still have two headsets, but I'm not bummed about the switches weakness because I figure I got my money's worth out of the product as a whole.  In certain areas of the house, there is a little static, but not to an objectionable degree.  The link between the headset and the charger base unit is radio, so static happens in certain places as with all radios, depending on local sources of interference.  I'm really happy with the product after years of using it, so this is a long term product review, rather than one written the day after opening the box.  These hold up very well with hard use over the long term."
RJRLOTK31J9W4,5,"The product works great. I can wander all over the house and yard getting things done, noisy things, and still hear what is happening in my favorite show or during football games. A little learning curve on the volume/tuning dials that probably should not be on the same ear, but they are comfortable and when my hubby wants to stay up late watching TV and I need to go to sleep, these are the answer to the noise issue! Highly recommend."
R3VLBP8BGLQ7VM,4,"I have two wireless headphones, one for each TV. I have a hearing problem and these headphones are the best answer. I can actually hear better with the headphones not wearing my hearing aids than  listening to the TV with just my hearing aids using the surround speakers with no headphones on. I have only one negative to say about the Sennheiser RS120, it has a tendency to slide on my head a bit. If I make sure they are positioned well there is no problem. The other headphones I own are Sony  RF970. The negative for them is that the phones not only automatically shut off when not using, but they often shut off when you readjust their position on your head or just move your head. This is especially  a problem if you are lying down. They also do not have the clarity of the Sennheiser RS120. The Sony phones still sound very good, but not as good as the Sennheiser.  Overall I found the problem of the Sennheiser slipping much easier to deal with than shutting off problem with the Sony."
R3S2CLFGU6ITDE,5,"This product works great.  NOTE~~~  If you have not messed around with audio in a few years and you have a relatively new flat screen TV you will need an adaptor.  In short, Flat screen tv's today use an optical connection and the sennheiser uses RCA jacks.  You will have to purchase a RCA to optical converter in order to plug this into your television.  Here is a cheap one. [...]"
R15CRJTZAV1LOO,1,"Purchased as a gift for my husband. Arrived on time and packaging was good.  However, the connection from the headphones to the charging cradle was not complete. It almost seemed like the wire included was for another model. Ordered a replacement. Received promptly by Amazon.  HOWEVER, same situation only worse!  Waste of my time. And I HATE returning items as the process if never correct.<br />Amazon services good.  Seinheiser sucks!"
R2BY5CB1MIDDMK,5,Bought these for my husband for Christmas!! He loves them!!! They have excellent sound and go along way without interruption!!!! Great gift!!! Wife points!!!! Great when football is on all day too!!!!
R3DMXRMKA2W8IN,5,"I needed a cordless headset to watch TV for me and my roommate.  We work opposite shifts and TV volume was and issue.  I did lots of reading and research before coming across this cordless headset.  I wanted something economical but still had good sound.<br />Easy set up and worked great the first time.  Cordless reception distance is great, and sound also.  I have never ran out of a charge! Adapter enables me to listen to TV or computer with multiple connection types.  If you are looking for value and great sound this is the one for you.  Do your research.  Cordless headphones are very expensive.  If you are and extreme music lover this sound may not be good enough for you but for me its perfect.<br />Only negative is headphones slip forward and almost fall off if you tilt forward too much."
RI38QZ3D8SEL0,5,"After using my first pair for the past 6 months, I have decided to buy another set. I have my current set connected to my computer. The second set will be connected to my surround system so I can watch it with my 56 inch Samsung DLP TV.<br /><br />Now with two pairs, two people can watch the TV without waking up anyone else in the house.<br /><br />The range of these headphone are very far. I can go into my garage, and empty out the garbage without missing any of my music as I listen to my music collection on my iTunes.<br /><br />The base charges the batteries without any problems. I am still using the original batteries, and they still hold a good change so I can watch several movies with doing a rechange in between the movies.<br /><br />I'm sure you will love this headphone as much as I do. With the price, you can't go wrong."
R2ZYYDKL47U6JC,5,"Great clarity, good range, comfortable, wife's happy! They were easy to hook up, had to buy 2 tv out splitters though!"
R1HGMJ2GHB6Q55,5,"I just got these today and am very impressed!  Great sound, no hiss, buzz or feedback.  Just what I was hoping for from Sennheiser!"
R2K8C76DFV4CYO,1,This product was not good as it was very loose on the head / ears. The headphones dropped when you looked down.
R236MC89E4V1R6,4,"Delivery of this product was prompt and lives up to my expectations. Very simple to set up and we easily moved it from one location to another, Took me a moment to figure out how the cradle recharged the lithium batteries in the headset but soon noticed two narrow metal strips inside the headphone band make contact. RF headphones unlike Infrared allows one to be far from &#34;line of sight&#34; and I was able to listen to TV from the downstairs Bedroom all the way to the far end of our home on the second floor w/ no loss of reception. certainly a good value."
R2V5OPY4KCT7NN,4,"So I have had this for a while now and here's what I think.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It does give a good, quality sound without any hissing/noise<br />- I can even go downstairs with it on and keep hearing the TV very clearly<br />- It's nice to have a product that is not battery dependent and charges itself<br />- The ear muffs are very comfortable and still stay that way with time<br />- It's aesthetically pleasing to the eye<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It would be nice if it were easier to use with multiple electronics without having to unplugging everything<br />- It shuts off after a minute or two of not receiving transmission. This can be annoying because the noise can be quite loud."
RXGB93OLE9JE,5,"These wireless headphones are one of my best purchases.  I'm kind of a night owl, so watching TV can wake up the family.  I can watch movies and actually turn it up.  These are great."
RNPJUJA5EXMBG,4,These headphones are comfortable to wear and provide very good sound.  I would give them 5 stars except that they tend to have a little static particularly when there is no signal and sometimes when you move around.
R174KO9JR2ZVBQ,1,"Right out of the box it didn't function. Tried it on all possible charging sources, including my laptop, as well as putting in my own rechargeable batteries. It was intended as a gift; fortunately I decided to give it a full charge before wrapping. Returned it and bought something else for the intended recipient."
R51D5RRXV5C06,5,"Although I purchased many times from Amazon.com, this is only my second review. The first was written because the product failed. This review is because the product far exceeded my expectations or least my wife's expectations because she is the one who often uses it due to her hearing difficulty. The Sennheiser was purchased to replace TV Ears that was problematic because of its poor battery capability, unimpressive sound quality and the ear pieces fell off and got lost. The sound quality of the Sennheiser is far superior to the TV Ears and the range is many times greater. Unlike TV ears you can walk anywhere in the house and still hear perfectly. Also the quality ear phones are much more comfortable than the stick like ear pieces provided by TV Ears. My wife has thanked me many times for purchasing this for her so I felt an excellant review is in order. Incidentally the cost was almost half of TV Ears.<br /><br />Albert Smith"
RY7F1L7OJSD5H,5,Bought this for my elderly parents who have some hearing loss. They love these headphones for watching TV. My mother said it was the first time in a long time that she understood what everyone was saying and she truly enjoyed watching a movie again. I would recommend these headphones for anyone but especially for someone with a hearing loss.
R13M9QBLYCWJ64,4,"Best wireless headphone for the money I've ever found. The other reviews have pretty much covered all the issues, but I've got to reinterate the frustrating ergonomic issue of putting the volume and tune controls right next to each other. My dad is 84 and uses these to listen to TV and audio books and he is constantly screwing up the tuning when trying to adjust the volume."
RBW35FJW101UP,5,This is the best purchase I've ever made.  My husband can watch and listen to the TV and I can't hear it!  Took us a bit to figure out that the cables needed to be connected to the digital cable box instead of the TV.  The instructions included were minimal at best.  We consulted the Amazon message boards and found the cable box suggestion.
RTZQI2U0TTXB8,3,Sound pretty good but you can't keep them on your head.  No matter how tight you make them when you turn or tilt your head they fall off
R282GIP0Q5OKM6,5,"Nice sounds, long distance, battery last forever.  I should have got them a long time ago.  I looked at head phones forever. Thanks!"
R2BV54UL6344ZT,5,"Bought these in April 2012.  They get used nearly every day.  Great quality sound.<br /><br />If one person wants to sleep and the other wants to watch TV, this is a great solution."
RLPPSDQOJM84L,2,"Don't sit well on one's head and not that comfortable. Can't relax in the evening when I want to watch TV. Doesn't recharge well and overall poorly designed. Spend an extra $20 and buy a better quality Sony set, which I had for years and was really happy with. Am going back to them."
R2SUWZHGT56T0I,5,"A gift for my wife who uses them to listen to programs from the internet, Glen Beck, Michael Savage.  They are extremely comfortable.  She loves them."
R8NYM34LPED2M,5,"I bought this because  I am sick and tired of the constant nagging my cow wife spews from her double chin. Now I can sit up stars and watch ICarly, Dallas and Hill Street Blues in peace. Not only has it brought back sanity I won't have to do any jail time.<br /><br />Oh by the way the quality is great on the headphone"
R20LSU8S2FR5WZ,3,"I bought these so I could listen to the TV in our bedroom while my wife was sleeping.  So out of the box, I couldn't get them to work and the meager instructions that come with them are near useless.  I kept fiddling with the tuning and did get to hear some neighbor phone calls, but not my TV.  Fortunately, there is a fair amount of technical information in these reviews so I learned that I had to crank the sound up on the TV really high and they would work better.  Indeed, this helped tremendously.  I could now hear the TV sound with only an occasional crackle of static.  But the problem of maintaining the connection persisted.  Every 5-10 minutes the connection would drop.  This required me to turn down the TV sound, get up and pull the headphone jack out, plug it back in, and then crank up the sound again.  Not very convenient.  Also, I had to be sure to turn down the TV sound and unplug the headphones before I went to sleep or my wife would blast her ears off when she turned on the set in the morning.  Another peeve: the connectors have red and black RCA plugs and the instructions say to be sure to connect the red plug to the red output from your TV.  Wrong!  The red goes to the white and the black goes to the red.  Some past reviews have complained that a stereo plug is not included but my set had one.  One other item: the headphones would not sit correctly and charge when I initially put them on the cradle.  I spread the cradle a bit and that fixed it.<br /><br />I'm trying to decide whether to keep them or not.  Maybe some more fiddling will improve the dropped connection problem.  Does anyone out there have a solution?<br /><br />UPDATE (3/22/13)  Procrastination led to me keeping the headphones. Too lazy to remember to send them back.  So I tried them again and they seemed much better.  They stopped dropping the connection.  I found that I had to sit up higher in bed for them to work well.  If I slouched down close to a sleeping position, the connection wasdropped.  If I sat up it was good.  There is still an occasional crackle of static but other than that they did the job.  I still have to crank the TV to maximum volume for the headphones to work well, with the associated problems that creates.  But I can now watch TV late at night while my wife sleeps.  I'm still having some problems getting them to sit correctly on the cradle so that they charge.  Also, a comment I forgot last time is that the ear cups are pretty cheap -- actually there are no cups, just a flat cloth covered surface.  Not particularly comfortable.  I'd now give the headphones 3 stars -- they work but they are far from perfect."
RMECQT01RZCQG,5,I bought this for my husband and he is very pleased with the quality and sound.  He loves the fact that he can walk around in the house and still hear his tv programs.
RBMJOMHJ7AMCE,5,I read all of the reviews before I purchased this and agree that it is a very good product.  I am hard of hearing and it provides me with the quality of sound I was looking for.
R16TAVH5QCY1BS,5,"Quality, clarity, volume, range, scope, beats, motivation, inspiration, funnovation.  Speechless.  I'm all over the doing errands, in the shower, on my bed, for wireless happiness.  Great for work and home activities.  A+++"
R39BH082KF5VR4,2,"they slide off you head to easy and your ear gets hot after a short time, the don't fit snog need more adjustment room"
RIK4PI5CQOI77,5,This product allows my hearing impaired husband to watch TV and hear it even though he's severely hearing impaired. His hearing aides do not allow him to hear the TV. We are pleased.
R12ICSNPIRAUIG,3,"I have several sets of headphones, including some cheap corded<br />($50) audiotechnicas for my small home studio, yamahas ($40), some $20 dollar marshmallows for my ipod, $200 beats and a couple of sets of Plantronics for gaming. I bought these for my son who is in college. They are just not very good. They don't fit well, the pads are scratchy on my ears, there is a lot of hissing and popping even a few feet away, and they feel sort of flimsy, honestly. Granted these are my only pair of wireless headphones, and I see what you trade for this feature. Pretty much everything. For someone who wants to listen to music in a dorm and maybe not have a wire they are okay. For the money the wired Beats are pretty good, sturdy and comfy and very rich sounding, but I like my 50 dollar wired audiotechnicas, and, for 15 bucks, the Marshmallows are really quite good.<br />If I had it to do over I would have gotten him something else.  I don't want to waste any more time critiquing these headphones with pros or cons because I think I said it all here ."
R2XR8MAMR5IIQ9,5,"The sound quality is great, and they're very lightweight. Charging is very easy, and cordless. There aren't set channels, but a tuning wheel, which makes isolating your device much more efficient - no static or background noise. I haven't tested the range yet, but if it is comparable to the other qualities of this product, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."
R6A2S9BCOSIC6,4,I think this is a good product but I do not like having to tune in the headphone to the transmitter.  The knob can be shifted putting on or off the phones and then will need to be readjusted.
R2P0MFMJUEGFF7,4,Got these as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves them. Fit is comfortable and sound quality is great. Easy to set up and use.
R283CJZSOKUEQ8,1,"This Sennheiser wireless  headphone comes with a AC adapter that powers and recharges the transmitter base. I had difficultly trying to plug the AC adapter into the transmitter base. The large connector was not designed for the small space in the unit for the connector. I finally got it connected and saw the green power LED on, and went to turn on the headphones and all I got was a hiss.  I looked at the transmitter base and the power and charger LED are both off.  I tried unplugging re-connecting over and over again but the unit would not turn on.  My suspicion is that these are purchased from 3rd party and the the Sennheiser company dose not bother to test them or order them with connectors that are made specifically matching the transmitter base end.  This is the second time I bought a wireless headphone were I had issues with the cheap AC adapters that come with them. I'm now using a 20 foot RCA plug that cost only $5.98 instead of wasting over $98.00."
R3MLKQB8TOIMFN,3,I know the product is very good (I have one) however this time the charger was not included. This purchase was a present. I wonder if the charger can be sent to my address. The present was sent abroad.
R2EDPJ09JKIVVN,1,This sucks.  Don't buy it.  NOt much more to say.  Better off buying anything else.  Anything at all; its terrible
R3GQE4LBTYHBLI,5,"I purchased them for my Mother, who is very hard of hearing.  With the wireless headphones she can again enjoy hearing music and listening to her favorite tv shows.  She is 95 years old."
R2GPTBI911HY7Q,3,"I bought these because I live in a small house and didn't want to bother my girlfriend with the TV in the morning and when she is sleeping.  It works well, but it occasionally disconnects when there is silence in the programing, and wines in your ear.  There is also a hum in the background.  It is tolerable for the reasonable price."
R2920I8ORTM8PV,5,"Saved my nights!! Husband has hearing problems and tv is too loud for me to read or sleep n bed, with these he can hear tv and I have quiet!!!"
R32WAZ3RUQY0FX,5,"Purchased to replace a lower-grade set that wore out. Use with TV. Very pleased with quality & comfort of phones and ability to use standard AAA batteries in addition to the provided rechargeables. One of the greatest features is the way the phones charge by induction on the transmitter -- just hang them on the stand and they are charging! Very superior to other brands where precise placement is required -- and way too difficult to achieve on the first try. Great sound, and excellent broadcast range. We can walk around the first floor of the house to get a drink or snack, check on laundry, take a bathroom break, etc., and get good audio throughout. Haven't tried upstairs. Bought a second pair of phones and the transmitter sends to both just fine. No problems with interference, etc. Love them!"
RA5SAF0I9LQ0E,4,"They are great sounding, adjusment volume & frequency.  I gave them to my husband (after my brother in law bought a pair) and he uses them often, the only downside is that his ears get hot and often doesn't like to wear them for long periods of time."
R1J0IQR1QEXJD9,5,My husband is losing his ability to hear the TV unless it is up to the volume of everyone in the neighborhood hearing it also.<br />I purchased this product for him for Christmas and he is more than pleased with it and doesn't miss anything even though he can be out of the room.  The range is excellent and he is one happy listener and so am I. Recommend this product highly.
R324ME9KZKAIZB,5,I got these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them. They arrived within a few days are were packed well. I like them because they take up a small space on our TV cabinet. He now listen to his SyFy movies while I listen to my music. :).
R1K47YSVFSJ85V,5,"I'm not interested in what my wife is watching on TV in the kitchen and she's not interested to what sounds are coming from what I what I'm watching in the living room close by. These are the answer for me. The sound is fine for me and not having a wire to contend with is nice. Some people don't care for the fact that if there's no sound for a few minutes (like if you pause your program) they are going to shut off, but it doesn't bother me and I just wait for a few moments and it comes back on. You can pay a lot of money for ear phones and I'm sure that they are great but these were reasonable and they work just fine for me."
R22AYM86YK2JB1,5,Just what I was looking for -- easy on the ears and great sound -- very satisfied with this purchase..
R1NT5R67K63TCN,5,"My grandfather is 84 years old and is a little hard of hearing, With that in mind i bought him these headphones for Christmas so he could actually hear what everyone was saying and so the tv did not have to be so loud that it annoyed the rest of us trying to watch or mind our own business in the house.<br /><br />The charging cradle gets plugged into the outlet and to the Tv via wires , but the range of the wireless headphones are actually quite good. My grandfather is only maybe 10 feet from the Tv and there is a minimal hum you can hear if there is absolutely no sound playing but nothing to be worried about.<br /><br />Another nice thing is the Tv speaker volume and the volume of the headphones are two different things, as in I can have the Tv muted and he can still hear with the headphones, or he can have his headphones loud and i can have the Tv lower.<br /><br />Battery life is amazing, ive seem him wearing it 5 hours straight and still going strong, he charges it every night and has had no problems.<br /><br />For the price this was a great buy, i might have to buy another for my grandmother since shes jealous"
R2L2WZACC218J3,5,These head phones work very well.  My husband no longer has to watch the TV full blast!  I enjoy them as much as he does!
R1IEVX6JU4FTUO,5,"I have to admit I don't use them.  They were purchased for my husband who is about 70% deaf in both ears.  He wears one hearing aid, but needs one in both ears.  He was blasting us out of the house before.  Now, he can use these and not turn the TV up so loud.  They were easy to set up, just plugged them into the audio output on the TV and plugged the cord into the electric plug, ready to use!  So far no interference with our wireless router.  I did put them on to check them out and was very pleased with the sound.  They didn't feel uncomfortable either.<br /><br />The only comment my husband made was he can't hear me when he wears them, which I consider a good thing!  I'm planning on getting my son a set of these.  He turns music and TV up too loud at his house.  I want to help my granddaughters to not go deaf from his music!<br /><br />Very impressed ease of setting them up, thought I would have to ask for help, but didn't."
R2UQRHZMD8QKQD,5,"I had previously purchased the tv ear, that you hear so much about..they were lousy..I bought these and I am so thrilled. the sound is awesome and I can walk to another room and still hear my shows...I recommend these headphones...a great find and the Amazon prices, are wonderful.."
RKPEO6Z1LDJ5F,5,"These wireless headphones are just the thing for me. Now I can watch TV late at knight and not disturb anyone that is sleeping! Also, when there is a lot of background noise from the family and friends, I can listen to every word of a broadcast that is important to me. These headphones are well worth the money as compared to some cheap models I've had in the past!!"
R30FWHLANN1QTE,3,"Occasionally I will hear brief static when moving but otherwise they sound very clear. No noticeable hissing sounds. Only real complaint is they don't reproduce and low bass at all, just highs and mid range."
R1BMLHJ71LPBU,4,They work great no signal interference what so ever. They are a little loose on my head. They are so lite that you even forget they are on sometimes. I've no issues with the range.
R2362F6QV8216M,1,"I ordered the RS 120 headphones for Christmas, mainly based upon the comments I had read from other users.  I have just finished repackaging the headphones to send them back to Amazon for a refund because I could not get them to work.  I suspect that the unit they sent me was defective, and I could have opted for a replacement product, however after pouring over the sketchy instructions, and trying to get the product to work, I have decided to try a different brand all together.  One pre-purchase concern I had was that some of the user comments had hinted that these headphones might be better served by someone way more knowledgeable than I regarding audio electronics.  My initial reading over instructions that appeared to have been translated into English (and with some difficulty) alerted me that my worst fears were about to be realized.  So I think I will shop around a little more and try to find a pair (from Sony maybe?) that appear to be a little more user friendly.  Respectfully submitted from Avon, Indiana."
R2J93DY1SKSY7T,5,"I bought the Sennheiser 120's for my husband to wear while watching TV or playing video games.  Being hard of hearing, he would turn the volume up so high, there could be no other conversation in the room.  They really work!  Very easy to hook up and use.  He has not had any problems with static or volume control, as mentioned in other reviews.  Also, very easy to recharge.  Great product!"
R17GKIMJ6E7HWA,2,When you put the headset on to charge it is lopsided and I need to use a clip to hold it.  The sound is great and I will eventually send it back as for the price I paid I should not have to put up with clipping it on to cradle.
R201MQSO4A5FGG,5,"This is a great product! The quality of sound is just outstanding, plus the range is also excellent--even thru walls!"
R6YRKI96XNZE0,5,"This has been a great thing.  Now I can read while my husband watches TV.  We made the mistake of putting in the wrong batteries, but that was our fault.  It works great now."
R1RUBG2JVUJO3M,4,"I have had these headphones for 3 years now. A year ago I would get a lot of popping and static when adjusting the volume. I cleaned the head piece with a can of compressed air and this reduced the problem by 80-90%.<br /><br />Recently the problem returned with the left earpiece cutting in and out when I adjusted the volume. I cleaned the contacts on the volume and tuning dials with  WD-40, and the headphones are working like new again! The sound is much better than my Sony MDRRF985RK."
R3QUU9E7E0KCUY,5,"Fantastic  2nd set purrchased  work great  good value  ladies if your husband likes tv on all the time, great investment for some peace and quiet!!!!  Great for sleeping in when he gets up early!!!!  Sure saves  on moody mornings"
RR8Y577NOQAB1,5,"I was concerned about this purchase after reading some other reviews.  However, the wireless headphones are working very well for us.<br /><br />My husband listens to movies and music at louder levels than I do.  I work from home and he has the sound going while I'm trying to work in the next room.  Also, he likes to watch television in the evening more than I do - which means I used to have to endure the loud noise or move to a less comfortable room for reading.  For me, these are great because they give me peace and quiet.<br /><br />I'm relying on my husband for the rest of this review.  He is usually very picky about sound quality, but he tells me the sound is excellent, even giving him the surround sound effects of our expensive sound system.  He has no problems with losing the blue-tooth connection or dropping connection - but he is staying in our great room and kitchen area, not going outside with the headphones.  He did discover the issue of the headphones thinking that the base was turned off if there was an extended period with no sound, but learned to work around that fairly quickly.  If he mutes commercials, he turns off the headset until he sees the show coming back and unmutes.  He tells me that the headset is warm to wear for extended periods, but not excessively.  And, as he points out, it's tough to cut out all outside noise without a good ear covering - and that causes the heat."
R2J9ADIZPDEMFR,1,This item has never worked. All I get is static. I would not recommend this piece of junk electronics to anybody. Do not buy a Sennheiser headphone. I wasted a good chunk of money.
R1TM0QEZQ9YDM8,5,"I got these so I could watch TV while on the treadmill without annoying my housemates with a blasting TV. I did a lot of research before selecting these, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
RQRV9Q6IMHD6J,2,"Decent sound but often has loud static which requires me to unplug at amp, then back on. Over a period of 2 hrs.it happens 3-5 times. Very annoying. I also find it very uncomfortable on my head. Because I had some batteries in it that became acidic i bought another pair and now have two. I since replaced both pairs with rechargeable LI-ions that work fine but I still have the static problem. Wishj I could find out what causes that?<br />skratch98"
RK7DDSTD6DCVD,5,works well<br />very easy and sounds awesome. has very long range... use it in my garage and its better than the wife yelling
R17EEEWL399899,5,Bought this for my husband.  It's his second set.  He wanted a second set to use while he's working in the hard.  They are super!
R3MLMX7TSNEXXA,5,"The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. The sound on these headphones is absolutely amazing, and they are very easy to figure out and to use. The range is very good, and we can walk around our entire house and still hear perfectly with these headphones."
R2F5H35KTAYTWD,5,"Bought this for my husband and we both love them.  We have a 2-story house and get the sound throughout the house.  Great sound, easy to wear, adjust volume and turn off and on.  They even work while on the elliptical, which was the initial reason for the purchase."
R3990BJTMR0C8B,2,"Works ok, decent sound, minimal interference, but thin cover material and relatively heavy weight make for uncomfortable on-ear wearing experience."
R319S6RL8E5O50,5,Purchased these for my husband to replace &#34;TV Ears&#34; which kept on breaking.  These are far more sturdy and he likes them much better.  So do I.  We can both listen to the TV without me being blown out of the room when he has to turn up the volume so he can hear.
R1DBTDBILW2QMI,4,Only issue there is no adjustment to tighten the headset.  Also everyone next to you can hear whatever you are listening to.
R3NXKVOF9HPFJE,5,Just does whats it's supposed to do. It's nice to know that it is always charged and ready to use. You won't be disappointed and this it the third one we purchased and gave as a Christmas gift to our son.
R3C3XRZDTLFBH5,5,"I do not do a lot of reviews but I think this product deserve it. I will not bother you with a technical and long review; in simply words the product is great. Got it out of the box and running in 15 minutes, sadly I did have to wait for the batteries to charge, instructions stated 24 hours I could not wait more than 12. My only complaint is that my wife tricks me, she bought this for me but it is actually for her, now I watch TV as late as I want while she is sleeping like a baby."
RIBNXQ0E8G47S,5,"I read reviews for this before buying and they were quite mixed (and some too technical for me), but I gave it a try.  Years ago I bought a cheaper product which not only failed to carry a signal well but the ear foam broke down.  This works well, I can move around the house and go down stairs or in the yard with little change in quality.  If you have a lot of flourescent lights or such, you might have a brief interruption.  Once they just did not work, but after I unplugged it and plugged it back in, voila.  I can play loud RnR and not bother the wife; and a friend was impressed with the quality.  I don't think you could do better for the price."
R1LSTXNXD6FJTQ,5,"Arrived as promised, on time and in excellent condition.  This unit helps my hard of hearing father understand the TV without the rest of us having to have the volume so high."
R11VPQDG6MQ09T,3,"Too large for my head making it easy to fall off, otherwise okay.  Control of volume is good.  Glad I purchased."
R3I9RWCMJGWXNV,5,My husband likes the tv volume blasting and I like peace and quiet. These headphones were just what we needed. They work perfectly and are very comfortable. I bought another pair for my dad who is slightly hard of hearing. Now he can hear and understand the dialogue and can enjoy watching movies and shows again. They are well worth the price.
R1OI6QLG6TRUGP,5,"I don't like to write if you want more than me clicking on the rating, I guess that thei is the last you hear from me."
R1OTQ9J9W5BMZJ,5,These headphones are the easiest to use of the three we have purchased. The charging system is particularly easy to use. Great sound.
R23RPCONORS511,4,"My wife is hearing impaired and uses headphones to listen to TV, eliminating the need to turn the volume up loud.  Sennheiser has been a constant in our home.  We have tried other headphones over the years, but keep returning to Seenheiser."
R13X23QRMT9AL4,4,"Good sound quality (Sennheiser products are 1000 times better than Bose).  Signal transmits well through my cabinet, can adjust the frequency and the volume from the headphones themselves without getting up.  Only problem with them is they are a little stiff so if you move around a lot, they can fall off. Otherwise fantastic."
R1SKRAVH5XHXWS,5,Very good clarity and range. I sit about 10 feet from the TV and they have never dropped out. They work anywhere I have gone  in a 2 story 1500 Sq foot townhouse. Three channels so if your neighbor has one there will not be interference. They have a small magnet that helps them make good contact when placed in the charger. A good design in all regards.
R2HJSBJVPLKMIH,2,"The rs 120 wireless head phones work. The recharge is great and so is the listing time. But the main problem is the head phones are way to loose, if you move they fall off. Had I known this ahead of time I would have looked some where else"
R39QHR2Q0JCKXE,5,These are a present for my son.  I read the reviews and chose these.  I think they will work well for him.  I wish they indicated if head size was an issue.  Guess we'll find out!  Shipping was fast and packaging was good!
RNBIRQ1FHT69B,5,"ITis everything as advertised. I have had no hissing noises, only clear and precise.sound. It has a phenominal range which I haven't gone beyond yet. including out in the yard. The charging system is so simple."
R1GS5TTR5TRCM4,4,"So here's my story: my house burned down in September and I was forced to live in an apartment for the first time in many years.  I had to buy a new TV and sound bar system which immediately got me into trouble with my neighbors, even after I tried cranking the volume way down and moving the subwoofer around.  Here's the thing: I enjoy watching movies but I'm hard of hearing and I like my sound jacked up, so I needed a solution.  Enter the Sennheiser RS120 wirless headphones.  They have proven to be the nearly perfect solution to my problem.  I followed the directions and charged them up for the initial 24 hours and they now work flawlessly.  I am again able to watch my movies at any volume I choose without bothering my neighbors.  The sound quality is very good for what are relatively inexpensive wireless headphones.  I did check out the Sennheiser RS180 headphones at my local Best Buy and the RS180's certainly have a much richer overall sound quality, but at more than $200 more I simply could not justify the price difference.  I can't say that the RS120s are the best there is for the price because that would obviously entail trying out and comparing every wireless headphone on the market, but I can absolutely say that the the RS120s are a fantastic bargain for the price.  But there are some caveats that you need to be aware of.  I've listed a few of the Pros and Cons here:<br /><br />Pros:<br />(1) Decent quality sound; bear in mind these are not $200+ headphones, but they certainly rival many headphones costing much more; I have had no static issues that I'm aware of, but as I said, I am hard of hearing (but primarily in upper range frequencies)<br />(2) Good range--I can walk all over my place and never have any problem losing signal.<br />(3) They just work and work well!<br />(4) Comfortable (but see #1 below)<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) Tend to slip off of my head if I bend my head too far forward; it's not a huge deal, but they don't really hug my ears as well as I would like; still, they're very comfortable<br />(2) You do have to be careful when you lose signal; you will get some loud static; the solution is to make sure to turn the volume down. Just to be fair: this is going to be a problem inherent in virtually ANY wireless system.  Signal loss goes with the territory.<br />(3)  This is the big one:  the analog connection is for component ONLY. You can either plug it straight into the red/white RCA jacks or use one of the included adapters for various headphone jacks or other ANALOG outputs, but since my TV does not have analog component outputs, the only way I can watch regular TV with these is through an optical coax to analog converter (which will set you back another $40).  I AM able to plug the red/white component jacks into the back of my Blue Ray player with no problem, but I am unable to use them with just straight TV without the converter.  This is really a significant drawback because otherwise, these are really nice headphones.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that in spite of the Cons listed above, I am still very satisfied with the RS120's sound quality, performance and price.  I can highly recommend them to many users.  Just keep in mind some of the caveats listed here, primarily Con #3 above (analog only hookup).as I would like; still, they're very comfortable<br />(2) You do have to be careful when you lose signal; you will get some loud static; the solution is to make sure to turn the volume down.

R1UIF64TSR33KE,5,"it's a great wireless headphone, can go a really long distance, there might be a little interference from other devices, but works just fine. Only one thing is bad is that it's kinda loose, it might fall when you bent down. Overall, it's amazing"
R2J833SAGMDPLC,1,"These headphones use a wireless transmitter and have rechargeable batteries.  The batteries are charged by placing the headphones on a cradle that is attached to the AC power supply. I installed the headphones according to instructions and let the rechargeable batteries charge overnight. Prior to purchasing these headphones, I had always used hard-wired headphones to listen to music. I have had very good experiences with other Sennheiser-brand hard-wired headphones and so I purchased this wireless set based on my previous positive experiences with the Sennheiser brand.<br /><br />For me, these wireless headphones performed very poorly.  The primary problem was poor reception that manifested itself as a loud hiss would come and go as my head changed orientation while wearing the headphones. The unit is equipped with a tuning dial that I was able use to the tune signal in clearly - but by simply turning my head or moving a short distance around my living room, the loud hiss would reappear and completely wipe out the audio.  For these tests, the stereo, the headphone transmitter and the headphones were all located in the same room. The kind of hiss I am describing is similar to the kind of hiss I have experienced while listening to an FM radio station on my car radio as I was driving through the mountains of upstate New York, right at the edge of the station's range.  Even under the best situation, where I got the headphone signal tuned in clearly, there was still a slight hiss in the background that was always present when listening to music on the headphones.  I have gotten accustomed to the perfect sound reproduction of a hard-wired set of Sennheiser headphones that has no hiss at all. For me, these headphones did not work out and I returned them."
R36SMSMDXYVYTH,5,Does the job very well. I does have a very little interference but you won't even notice for the most part.
RMWQPUDKV98T6,5,I've needed something like this for a long time. I stay up watching TV after my wife goes to bed and have always had to turn down the volume when a loud TV scene started and then back up again to hear the quiet parts. Now I don't need to do that any more! These work perfectly! I connected directly to the TV audio out jacks using the RCA plugs and turned the TV speakers off. Watching movies I've seen before I can hear things I've never heard through these headphones. The sound is GREAT and there is absolutely no hiss during quiet scenes. Totally silent. If you have any hissing noise you can turn the tuning dial until you get a perfect signal. I sit 10feet away from the transmitter so there is a clear signal but I can go anywhere in my 2400sqft house and still get a perfect signal through these. I have not experienced what some reviewers have said about the receiver turning off during quiet scenes and they are very comfortable to wear without ever falling off from moving around. If you want a great set of wireless headphones you can't beat these!!
RJFWNM9GVZTRD,4,"I've been using this model of wireless headphone since...ummm...at least 1997 and I think that was the second time ordering them. I've added over the years so now each family member has one. They still work and the couple that quit on me don't work because I accidentally put regular batteries in.DONT DO THAT! Also, the kids did not care for them so they were sat on often and broke. I did manage to revive a couple of the headphones by cleaning off the battery connection when it corroded from the wrong battery. Remember, that if you do somehow destroy<br />a headphone you don't have to order a new base as well. Just order the headphone and use the original base. They let me walk downstairs from the second story and even go outside! The only reason I gave it a 4 is pretty minor. It should be 4 3/4. Reason is...the fit of the headphone. I must have a smaller head although I didn't think so.  I wish it adjusted a bit higher and was not quite as cumbersome. Also...just a tidbit. If the sound is not adjusted right check the levels of your tv. For me when the tv volume is higher I have better quality and control coming from my headset."
R1IFBUYSCWCH93,5,I am so happy I finally broke down and bought these. Now I can watch TV without blowing everyone else out of the room! They work like a charm. great sound quality. Easy to hook up to the TV. They are a little bulky but not bad. I like that I control the volume on the headset and if anyone else is watching tv with me the tv volume can be adjusted for them.
R7NABODQMX8VP,1,"Trust me, you can find better headphones on here. These headphones are just bad.<br /><br />* They are super uncomfortable to wear on the head -- and overheat your ears.<br />* When the audio stops coming from the computer you are overwhelmed with a loud buzzing noise.<br />* Requires bulky non-standard charging stand.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble, buy a tiny Bluetooth adapter (10 dollars) and a pair of Bluetooth headphones (I recommend Kinivo, for $30)."
R1NX01A0MNT75G,5,"I got these for my mother because she has hearing problems and will sometimes turn the TV up WAY too loud for everyone else in the room. She says they work great - she can hear the shows very clearly, and the range on the headset is pretty good.  She told me that she routinely leaves the living room will wearing the headset and goes to the kitchen or even out to the mailbox at the end of their long driveway and she can still hear her show."
RUB3GO0ZS33D2,5,"I bought their wireless headphones 7 yrs ago in an electronics store. They have been dropped, slept on, stepped on, used daily and worn for upwards of 20hrs at a time, and survived 2 cross-country moves! they still sound wonderful! no static, hissing, loss of clarity, and not even the earpieces, pads or any other parts have worn out. The Brand name across the head piece is beginning to wear off a bit..Even their rechargeable batteries still work! These are great headphones, 1st rate quality and worth every cent. I have never had trouble with them. The biggest problem I have is that the adjustable head band has finally loosened a bit and the fine-tuning knob has gotten a lil wobbly..I am  buying a new set solely for the upgrade and because it will allow me to have a pair in living rm and in the bedroom..I like being able to adjust the channel and have found areas in which being able to select between the three channels allowed more clarity and better sound....too many auto-features can be distracting...especially when they adjust and I don't need them to...I looked at Sony's but see no reason to switch..these are great! Now, if you want to lie on your side or have really soft pillows the ear pieces will seem bulky as they are not fine or flat..I simply have learned to position myself comfortably without any problems..."
RNE6O9P5LE5OK,2,"I received these as an xmas gift to use in my office.  Normally, I wear a set of headphones connected to my computer with a headphone jack and extension line, but I was getting tired of my office chair rolling over the wire several times a day.<br /><br />These headphones sound ok, though it was a bit of a task to tune them into the receiver.  I couldn't completely get rid of a hiss in the background, though I was able to reduce it enough that it wasn't too much of an annoyance.<br /><br />The big problem with these headphones is that they don't stay on my head.  Any slight look downward (e.g., when I bend my head down to read papers on my desk) causes the phones to slide right off my head.  The headphones just don't clamp to my head with enough force to my head and ears.  I've got a pretty big head (size 16), so I suspect a large portion of users would have the same problem.<br /><br />Despite the problems with tuning and audio hiss, I'd keep these headphones if I didn't have to look down at my desk every few minutes.  As it is, I've got to return them and look for alternative wireless headphones.  I'm thinking of getting a bluetooth enabled set so that I don't have to worry about tuning and audio hisses."
R1WA1XMWUVANII,4,"I really like it. This way I can walk around the house listening to the TV while others are not bothered. So far it serves the purpose well. I like the charging station as well, it is easy to use."
R24STHYGXS6TI6,5,Excellent product. Great fit and works throughout the house. No static and as always superior craftsmanship from Sennheiser. Would highly recommend this product.
R22OMD90PCJJFH,2,adjustment control works poor.  hard to get proper frequency- sometimes imposable at 10 feet.  revew is set up hard to use. will not be revewing any more
RCFWL539I4H6T,4,bought these for my Dad who is hard of hearing he loves them and my Mom doesn't have to listen to a loud TV
R4VPDSDJD1461,3,"I am a little hard of hearing so I am not a good judge of fidelity I use wireless headphones to help me listen to the television without driving my wife out of the house. I purchased these to replace a pair of Sony wireless headphones that I have had for a number of year and were finally starting to fail. The Sony headsets were about half the price of these and when I bought them I just plugged them in and they worked fine. They fit well and were comfortable.<br /><br />When these arrived they took a fair amount of fiddling with them before I could get them to work. Now, when I am wearing them if I turn my head just right I rub the control dials of the headset against the headrest on my chair and I loose reception. A minor adjustment gets it back. With the Sony there was no on off switch. I just put them back on the cradle until I was ready to use them again. With these I often forget to turn them off before putting them back on the charger. So far this has not created a problem for me but, according to the instructions failure to turn them off between uses increases recharge time and reduces battery life. BUT, My biggest complaint is that I can not keep them on my head. Every time I lean my head forward they would fall off. One time when they almost fell in the toilet I was ready to return them. However, returning is such a hassle. I decided to try attaching an elastic strap to them. They now look ridiculous with the waistband of an old pair of underpants stapled to them but, at least the stay on my head and, other than my wife, there is seldom anyone around see me wearing them.<br /><br />Bottom line, they may have better fidelity than the Sony did, but, you can not prove it by me. Though they look stupid, they are reasonably comfortable after being modified using an old pair of underpants. I don't see them as very good value for the money and if I had it to do over I think I would pass on these and look for something more suitable to my needs."
R1KLBPWRCPYW85,5,"Bought these for my husband so he can watch TV in bed while I am sleeping.  They work very well.  If he has the volume turned up high I can hear a little bit of noise, but nothing that would make me unable to go to sleep."
R2B357P3W5UE2P,5,My dad has problems hearing so I got these for him a couple years ago so he could watch TV late at night without waking the entire house. He likes them and uses them all the time. They were easy to hook up to the TV and they sound great. I've used them a few times when I'm at his house and they sound great and are more than adequate for use with the TV.
R3QVSI99FY7KES,5,These are the best by far headphones (noise cancelling) you can buy. You can have the headphones turned on and put them on your chest and still hear the tv. The volume is fantastic. My husband wore them out to the mailbox and there was beautiful reception. BUY THEM THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE MONEY
RWVWX2YFD79KW,5,I bought these wireless headphones because we travel a lot in an RV. My wife does not like background noise when reading. I use the headphones which shuts off the speakers. Sound quality very good. Has a long range. I've walked 300 ft away from the RV with them and can still hear the TV. I wear them when out grilling and can see TV through the window. Didn't think I'd like them but got for my wife's peace. I actually enjoy having now that I've used. Good quality for the price in my opinion.
R3H1X3NUMV27LY,5,My husband wears hearing aids & needs a boost for tv.  He thinks these are great.  Had another brand & they didn't last long.
R2ZM5S6ORM59FX,2,"Unfortunately I'll be returning these headphones. They seem to work at my loft but when I brought them to the office there is a constant fast clicking that present on all channels and frequencies. Most noticeable during quiet songs or spoken word. The auto shut off is really annoying. If I pause a song for more than 5 or 10 minutes the headphones blast static into my ears. Then starting up a song takes them a 1 to 2 seconds to stop the static and start the music, clicking and all."
R3DAZLOIP3VRAR,5,It works just great.  I read other reviews about not being able to tune in to the station.  It works and tunes just as advertised.  Sound quality is very good.  Lasts at least 6 hours on a charge.  (that is the longest I tried to use it at one time).
R2Z9FVM609VEDC,5,Sound great to me.  I got these headphones because I do not hear well.  They provide good sound which I can hear without having to crank up the volume on the TV.  Range is excellent.
RAILCSLXG8JBA,5,This product is everything I had hoped for.  I can go outside and still maintain good quality sound.  Love it
R37WJ0DND0CB7K,5,"my wife uses these, and i get to enjoy not having the tv blaring all evening long. a real problem solved."
RZ7RI87GGXPO9,2,"The RS120 has great sound but ear pieces are not parallel with each other and angle out towards the back of the head.  Tilt your head down and the headphone falls off. I bet I've dropped mine 200 times in the year I've owned them. However, this does prove they're well built because they still work after all those drops."
R19ETMP8STE5X1,4,"It took me a while to get use to the headphones, but it is also because I moved into  new location that causes less interference. At first I was thinking of taking these headphones back because of the hisses and whisp of the 900 MHz analog waves. Then I moved to a new house and BAM, still hisses and whisp, but not bad enough to deal with RMA. THESE HEADPHONES ARE A GAMBLE depending on your location.<br /><br />There is a couple things you can do to reduce interference, but everything runs on wireless now-a-days, it's really hard to filter out all that for these headphones, but my best guess for the reason why they were so bad at my other place is because a station somewhere was broadcasting a powerful signal over my old house, making them hiss and whisp really bad.<br /><br /> I don't know why so many people gave these 5 stars, I would haven't had them better than 4, but I guess people are easily impressed. There is a few problems with them:<br />Cons:<br />1.) Interference depending on your location (-2 stars)<br />2.) Auto off switch<br />3.) A little large, not tight fitting on my head with all notches in... and I have a big head<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Great Range<br />2.) Sound Quality is pretty good for the price<br />3.) Charging station is easy to set and forget<br />4.) Can use with EVERYTHING b/c of adapters that is comes with (+1 stars)<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but not worth the price I can get a bluetooth for. I do like how it has all the adapter that you need though, making it practically universal to use for everything, which is the reason why I kept it at 4 stars."
R16K2TJU9LVW1X,4,My TV room is next to the kitchen and the noise from the dishwasher running made it hard to hear the TV.  These headphones solved the problem.  Now I have an excuse to ignore my wife when she starts yelling at me.  I have the transmitter and holder behind the TV and they work fine.  Some reviews state that after no sound is received from the TV they turn off and a loud noise is heard.  My headphones emit a soft buzzing sound which is not loud.  My only concern is that they will not stay on your head when you bend over or walk around.  The sound quality is very good.
R1FAQT653VMETH,4,"These turned out to be just about exactly what I wanted. There is some buzz/hiss but for the price, I think they work quite well. As others have noted, if you turn up the volume on the TV, you don't have to turn up the volume control on these headphones as much, so that reduces the hiss.  They are a bit stiff/rigid and the padding is not super plush, but it's decent enough for periodic use. I don't think I'd want to wear them all day in an office environment, though. The charge always lasts long enough for my use, which is typically watching a movie or a few TV shows."
R1TZUV75MTXA6S,1,1.  works intermittently<br />2.  requires too much user intervention; simple technology is not well implemented<br />2.  has shortcomings not listed<br />3.  overpriced;  its the application of a common technology utilizing inexpensive components
R30JG1RAS3FWCS,5,"Mom is 87, and has a little trouble hearing the TV. These were a great present for her, now she doesn't have to have the tv so loud!"
RYZLJG0IO9AWQ,5,"Easy setup, great range of signal, and wonderful sound quality.  The headset is comfortable and I can walk anywhere in the house and have clear reception."
R2YZDKEO5AI8L5,5,"Headphones performed as advertised.  Quality of sound is excellent, in fact, I find myself hearing background sounds I never heard before.  It is a great product for husband and wife that have differing hearing levels."
R2HC3MS28Y5FYO,2,"The problem with this headset is that it has  a &#34;short&#34; in the electrionics , as the sound comes on and off.<br />Very irritating."
R1RNYGAJ0F004K,5,"This was the best gift EVER for my husband!  He was THRILLED to be able to hear birds chirping & crickets doing whatever crickets DO!  THEN he realized he could walk around the house & still hear what was going on in the movie or TV show.  I can have the volumn all the way off on the external speakers if he's watching something I'm not interested in & he can hear his show.  Highly recommend this product for anyone who needs to &#34;read lips&#34; or is constantly saying, 'What'd they say??&#34;"
R24ICG8WW2X179,1,I couldn't get this to work with my Bose system.  The connections were not flexible enough for the system that I have.  Granted my Bose system is 5 years old.
R25EJK47PD6OMB,5,"I've had no problem whatever with these. Brought them home, plugged them in, and started using them. Great sound quality."
R3P7C1JEHX7XNM,5,"These are great!  They work very well.  It would be nice if they didn't block out the sound for other people.  There is probably a way to do that, but I haven't figured it out yet in our system.  I can walk all over the house and still hear perfectly."
R2W8GQ93VU8LZV,1,The headset is made of a slippery material that does not stay on the head well.  Reception is horrible and needs to be tuned in.  There was much hiss and 60hz hum.  Would not recommend these headphones.
R1RQ02YO602ZRB,4,"easy to hook up, very intuitive, no special skills or instructions.  excellent range, loud and clear walking throughout the house.<br />some static when I pause the DVR, but it clears immediately when I resume the program.  comfortable, quality sound, certainly for most uses, like watching TV, or movies.  charging light comes on when you return the headphones to its cradle/stand, nothing to plug in. just have to remember to turn them off when you take them off."
R1UMZ6FLYBMAS7,3,"I use these headphones with the TV and they do provide the high-quality sound expected from a Sennheiser product.  The reason I rate them down is that they are too bulky and heavy.  To sit in your easy chair and watch your favorite show, they are fine--if you stay put.  If you lean forward or bend over to pick up something you dropped, the  headphones will fall off and land on the floor.  For this reason, I cannot recommend them."
R3O8II4NFTQ85O,5,I ORDERED THESE ON DEC 4TH AND RECEIVED THEM ON DEC 6TH. AFTER FOLLOWING CHARGING INSTRUCTIONS I HAD HEADPHONES ALL HOOK UP WITHIN 5 MINUTES. I TURN MY TV ON THEN PUT HEADPHONE ON AN WOW I WAS TOTALLY TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY WITH THE AWESOME SOUND. THESE WERE SO EASY TO HOOK UP AND THE SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST. IN THE THREE DAYS OF HAVING THESE I HAVE DECIDED TO ORDER ANOTHER SET FOR ANOTHER TV. I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A GREAT SET OF WIRELESS HEADPHONES. I CAN'T WAIT TO LISTEN TO MY STEREO WITH THESE AWESOME HEADPHONES. JUST BLOWN AWAY.
RS8Y4W6VLRW1W,2,These headphones are not as clear as ones I previously owned.  You have to be careful about turning your head or you lose the signal.  I would not purchase them again
R1TX3NG1QTCMTA,1,"I bought these because of the high rating on amazon.  I thought wireless headphones would be great.  I could dance around or get things done with them on.  Not so.  The reception is dreadful.  I get hissing and if I move any more than 10 feet from my receiver the sound is horrid. I'd also like to point out that the speaker itself it just a flat squared off  piece that is supposed to sit on your ear.  There is no cushion around the speaker to help keep it on.  I have never seen anything like this.  They hardly stay on...  maybe just maybe if you want these to watch t.v. quietly they might be alright but for music, not a good idea.  I would've return them but I had moved shortly after I bought them and they were sitting in a box for a great deal of time.  I would not recommend these at all."
R2MEUS77HOG5ZA,5,"I needed something to allow me to watch TV and not disturb my wife, as our schedules do not always coincide. This product works GREAT and I have been using it for over a year with no complaints. Highly recommend."
R1O8GHRVYQ39NG,2,"I got these so I could watch TV in bed and not wake my girlfriend while she sleeps.<br /><br />Pros: Charge holds for a long time. Works well once you find the right frequency. Works all around my house.<br /><br />Cons: Unless you're using the 3.5mm adapter, this is a piece of garbage, best used as a paper weight. If ther eis no sound coming from the source (like if you're watching a movie and fall asleep and the movie ends) there is a loud (and I mean frightening loud) pop that is sure to wake you up in a panic when it returns to default power saver. Also a constant humming no matter how well you match the frequency"
ROLY19Y6A1OTH,5,These headphones have great sound and wonderful range.  We can walk to the mail box and still hear the broadcast.  Will buy them again when the need arises for a gift or myself.
R1GITJDSH0Z14K,5,These headphones are amazing.  I purchased them for my husband who has begun to have difficulty hearing.  I find that I where them whenever possible.  The sound is unbelievable. You would think you had surround sound or were in a theater.  You hear things that you would never hear just listening to the TV.  I HIGHLY recommend these headphones!
R2BSV5AFUSILGR,5,"Purchased for Hubby, he'd have the televison so loud it could be heard outside of the house.  It sits nicely and comfortably, he can adjust the volume to his liking and I'm not getting my ears blasted.  Easy hook up and operation."
R1OXWHC01WBSJ6,5,"I got these for two reasons ... I have over the ear hearing aids, but have a lot of trouble understanding voices on the TV even though the volume is turned up.  Music shows sound terrible, and my wife has trouble with the TV volume being too loud for her.  With the Sennheiser headphones, I get clear voice and music that is understandable, and I can set the volume up on the headset, and the TV volume down to a more pleasant level for my wife.  And, I don't get feedback even when I'm wearing the hearing aids with the headset.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
R2LRI168GEUWOD,4,"I have a hearing problem and use them watching TV,  They suit the purpose and I am pleased with them"
R93XGUJB1286,1,"When I first received this product, the charging cradle wasn't working; I had to request a replacement and the new item had the same issue; very disappointed!"
R3EPDOJW6YRX6C,3,"I've had these for several years, and they ended up being a backup pair of headphones, rarely my primary set. I just decided to order some Sennheiser MM 400's to replace them though.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Good range, through walls, etc. They're in the 900MHz band, which does provide long range signal.<br />* Comfortable fit<br />* Good sound usually<br />* Long battery life<br />* Base station charges internal battery. I've never had to replace the battery.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* 900MHz range, analog signal. It's like listening to AM radio. It crackles, if you shift your head the wrong way and hit some interference from something else, you hear a buzz, or it cuts out.<br />* When there's no sound for a few minutes, the base station turns off and you get a loud blast of static in your ears. This happens a lot when I forget I'm wearing them and the playlist ends.<br />* I don't like needing a powered base station for headphones. Takes up an outlet and desk space.<br />* Constantly fiddling with the tuning nob to find the right frequency.<br /><br />I decided to go with the MM 400's for the replacement set, since they are bluetooth and can pair to my phone or computer, plus they have an audio cable port for airplanes, older sound sources, etc. They charge over USB so no base station. And they won't have the reception issues."
R2NTJFCOJ26E8E,5,Bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They are comfortable and he can wear them quite a ways away from the TV and still hear it.
R3HIDFJOZSXQOJ,4,"but this is much better. Easy to hook up to audio out of TV, recharging base. Fits head well and like that I can be in kitchen cooking dinner and hear TV while husband saying &#34;Did you hear that?&#34; and I can say, &#34;Yes, I did!&#34;"
R3V4TP8WBBGW01,5,I will always by Sennheiser headphones.  They work extremely well & are well within my price range.  I have looked other more expensive ones but they don't get very good reviews & they are more expensive.
R1GHHFN84XNHD1,5,"I have had problems hearing for a couple of years and got tired of saying &#34;what did he say?&#34; every time we watched TV (or a movie).  These headphones are awesome.  My 16 year old son and I fight over them every time we sit down to watch a movie.  PS:  I ALWAYS lose at rock, paper, scissors.  I think he cheats!"
RXHHG1VR8CG4F,5,"This product works exactly as I thought it would. The range is reduced quite a bit when going through concrete but I had expected that and I only need it to work within 15 ft anyway. In order to tune it properly I adjusted it until I got the best reception at range. Overall easy setup, charging is simply. Great product."
RDW7VFZ91UBE1,2,"I read the reviews and thought there were some mental midgets out there trying to use them.  They were correct, I was incorrect.<br />The headphones are comfortable and provide great sound.  I have poor hearing and was amazed at how much more I could hear with these.  They worked perfectly for a day or so then became a real PITA!  I turn them on and all is perfect for 1 to 10 minutes.  Then the power light goes off and I get nothing but static through the speakers.  The only way I can correct this is by unplugging the headphones from my receiver, wait a moment for the power light to come back on then plug them back in.  I have tried everything imaginable to isolate the cause of this problem but have been unable to find anything.  I have a background in electronics design and repair but this has me stumped.  They are being sent back."
R1AYI7FMC5RWFV,5,"...i bought these headphone for my boyfriend ( love of my life ), because he didn't want to disturb my sleep when i work my midnight shifts and the sound, comfort, and convenience all build up an outstanding product....whether it's tv, video games, and or music, it all sounds spectacular... would strongly recommend ..."
R1R6TBV3OTZLX8,4,This is my first set of wireless headphones so I don't have something to compare this set too. The headphones were easy to install. The sound quality is very good. I went outside the house and could still hear good quality sound. The headphones are comfortable to wear. A good tip I learned from previous reviews is to turn up the volumn on the tv set. This method prevents any background distortion. The only negative I can come up with is the fit. Again they are comfortable but not a snug fit.
R31XMARBKHCIND,4,"Very good sound reproduction and amplification. Easy volume control,<br />Very satisfied with the product and will recommend to friends that may need it."
R15OM55N9PGM0L,2,"First of all, these headphones amplify the sound. You cannot have your TV on mute and listen through the headphones as you can with some makes.<br /><br />I bought this product 6 months ago and I thought about returning it immediately because sound was only coming from one side. However, the problem seemed to be fixed after some tweaking so I kept them. Randomly, however, there is a loud crackling noise and the sound disappears. After 6 months, the headphones only work some of the time. I will not buy them again. I did expect a better product from Sennheiser."
R1769XQ8YKA3LC,5,I use these headphones to watch TV quietly in the family room.  These sound good and are fairly comfortable and the recharging base is convenient.<br /><br />The only problem I had was the headphones not sitting flush on the base to make contact for recharging.  The easy fix was to extend the earpiece slightly on opposite the side that does not contact the base.
R1RGZJ76NC987I,5,"This is our second pair of earphones.  First one served well for over 10 years.  We weren't disappointed in current new headphones.  Wife especially loves them as she can work in kitchen  and hear clearly.<br /><br />F. Norman Vickers<br />Pensacola, FL"
R1TS2LAAT3E8F,4,"Headphones fall of head.  Has to wear a cap to keep from falling off when looking down.  Otherwise, system wors great and is saving the speakers on television from being blown!"
R2P4O8BS0RLWGU,5,"I had ordered this product back in Sept and liked it so much that I recently ordered a second one for another TV.  I had an old SOny one that produced static.  I get a clear tone with this, and I can hear the words quite well.  The only complaint I have it this - in Sept it was $60 + and now it was $99???"
RIVZ48O0KUVUW,5,Bought headset for wife for her TV viewing.  She loves it!  Great price for a hi fidelity headset!  Havd had for 2 years with no problems and same battery.
R1QV64192YCJM,5,I bought this mainly to use on the treadmill so we don't have to blast the tv speakers.  Works perfectly!  No issues.
R3SJFQNZUTX3CZ,5,I just started using these headphones and as far as I am concerned the connection is excellent with ultra clear sound . The charging craddle is extremely easy to use .
R2ADY1WESBOOIJ,5,Bought these  for my Hubby so now he can hear his TV and i can hear mine without hearing his also....Works great.......
RUUUYLKNHP2FP,5,"I bought these for my husband for his birthday so we could rock out to video games while I sleep in the next room. He loves them, and now uses them even when I'm awake or not home because the sound quality is so great and immersive."
R1BPRL87H0IDMB,5,"Great, clear volume and does not require line of sight to work - if you walk out of the room you can still hear the program. Very easy to adjust to find a good working frequency. A little tricky to put on the cradle - if you don't pay attention it might not be sitting correctly on the wire \\""ears\\"", which provide the power to charge the headphone batteries. It's been in use for six months and works reliably. I recommend it more for TV than for critical music listening, there is a slight low-level hiss which is not distracting with video but might be with music, all wireless headphones seem to have this problem. Overall, highly recommended."
R2A4PLG3TO031V,5,we have being using this one for more than 1 year now and very satisfied with the product. I brought 2 Sony before. I like this one better.
R2BHM4XACOERM1,3,"These have pretty good sound considering the price BUT since they sit on the ear, not over the ear, they are very uncomfortable if you're trying to deal with glasses and/or hearing aids. Also, they can't be used in the same area with some of the other Sennheiser (RS 130 for one) because although each headset was connected to a different computer, we could not each listen to different things due to bleedthrough? (whatever you want to call it). I was trying to listen to music, hubby a product review, and we both heard the other's sound in the background. This was coming though the headsets, not because either one of us had the volume up. Changing the channel on the heaphones and bases did not correct this. One set of headphones' transmitter was set on '1' and one on '3'."
R3BDFDML1IEXG2,5,"My daughter and son-in-law bought the original for me. But, I needed a set for the &#34;Mancave&#34; and bought these on-line from Amazon at a much lower price than my kids paid. They were both convinced this wasn't the real deal until they compared all the paperwork. I think they are converted to Amazon buyers now!"
R3M70Z63Z8S228,3,i ended up selling these because they had static and i was using the speakers for mixing music.  stick with wired headphones
RWXXO1VSE2A5,5,"My old Sony pair just broke one day. I ordered the Sennheisers for about the same price. The wireless signal is superior with no fade in, fade out. There is a signal tuner that is handy. The sound quality is wonderful. The one drawback is that the ear pieces slide on the ears so that bending over in the kitchen may mean grabbing to keep the headset from falling into something."
R3RV4DNWIXG4Y2,5,"This is a wonderful item.  If someone in the room wants to look at TV and the other doesn't this does the trick, love it!"
R377CESM1USHJQ,5,"I rate this very high because I use it because of my loss of hearing.  My husband bought me the first set for the family room, I ordered another pair for the bedroom.  They sound is very good"
R1OFC5TYFHO7PO,5,I wasn't so sure when I first opened the box- it looked flimsy and I didn't think it was going to be a hit. The quality of sound and strength of the connection are superior
R3UTIE9AH6ZCKC,4,"I got these wireless headphones primarily so that I can listen to audio at night and not disrupt my girlfriend when she is trying to sleep.  They have worked out wonderfully for this purpose.<br /><br />I have liked other Sennheiser products in the past so I thought I would give these a try.  I should mention that I got these refurbished for under $60.00.  You can purchase a new pair of the RS110 wireless headphones and get the same thing but without one feature I consider important, not having the rechargeable batteries.  Even if you were to install rechargeable batteries on the RS110 model they would not have the ability to be charged by just resting them on the cradle of the transmitter this set has.  That is worth the difference to me right there.  So far I have not needed to change channel settings to get a clear signal so whether it is worth the extra money for the RS120 is difficult to say.  Perhaps if one has a 900MHZ cordless phone it might be a more useful feature to have the ability to change channels to avoid that interference.  There is a cordless 900MHZ phone in my home but it is upstairs away from where I use these and I have not had any issues from it.  It may be a better buy to get the RS110 headphones if you don't need the multiple channels.<br /><br />These headphones have a transmitter which has a small AC adapter that plugs in to the wall to provide power to the base unit which is the transmitter and charger for the batteries located inside the headphones.  The headphones themselves use a pair of AAA rechargeable batteries that are installed by removing one of the foam pads from the headphones to uncover them.  The ear pads come off with a twist to gain access to the batteries and I suppose if ever needed to replace the pads themselves if ever worn out.<br /><br />SOUND: I get very clear sound through these.  I have a home theater which is my primary use for them so I can watch TV or other content on my home theater at night. I have a very nicesurround speaker set up and while I do notice a difference between a high end multiple speaker system with a powered subwoofer it is not anything that is an annoying transition to what these are capable of putting out.<br />The ad talks about \\""Bass Response\\"" as a feature however there is no \\""Bass Boost\\"" or other way to increase bass on these other than to increase it at the source you have them plugged in to.  The frequency response is 22Hz to 19500Hz and so that is a typical full range of sound although I have noticed some other wireless headphones with slightly lower frequency response such as 20Hz.  I have however played music of various varieties through these and have not had any issues.  I am a musician and like to listen to music and have no issues with the sound from these.  That said if someone absolutely has to have really high amounts of bass these might not be able to deliver that.  For me from TV programming or movies to music I am perfectly happy with the sound from these.  I was only willing to spend so much and do not feel the need to have more than these can deliver and have no plans of saving up for a higher end set.<br /><br />There is a small wheel on one side of the headphones to adjust the volume level on the headphones so you don't have to adjust the volume from the source once they are in use.  Next to that is another adjustment for frequency, this is to tune the headphones in for clarity just as one would do with an analog radio. Once I have done this I have not experienced any static at all.  Even when the headphones are turned on and there is no sound coming through them I do not hear any hiss as some have said they experience.  No complaints on sound of this system from me.<br /><br />COMFORT: I find these very comfortable for wearing for long period of time.  They have flat foam that covers ones ears, I far prefer this to having something going inside my ear or even smaller headphones that rest inside the ear (those types with 1/2 inch or so foam).  As I use these at night and end up often falling asleep I do not wake up with any ear pain which is great.  These are also very lightweight and do not put pressure on the sides of my head from too much tension yet stay on just fine.<br /><br />SOUND ISOLATION: These headphones do not have any fancy noise isolation or noise cancelling functions to them.  They also do not have over the ear surrounds to help seal them to your ears.  This is not an issue for me but it does mean that one could potentially have to turn up the volume on these headphones to overcome any other unwanted sound in the surrounding environment.  Again not an issue for me at all, I could hear someone talking or even like right now I can hear myself typing on the keyboard.  None of that is an issue for me, I have them at pretty low volume and if I wanted would turn them up if I was annoyed.  What environment you are in when using your headphones will dictate what features you might want to have if you don't want to hear any other sounds and have the volume low at the same time.<br /><br />VERSATILITY:  These work great for me for all my uses.  The transmitter comes with RCA connectors which one would use for things like the audio out from a TV or other device that does not have a headphone jack.  The set also comes with an adapter that plugs in to those and turns it in to a full size \\""phono\\"" plug, the type of connector that large headphones are usually plugged in to.  Then one can pull the large phono jack off to reveal a 3.5mm jack which is what one uses for things like smartphones or most computers or other smaller devices.  So this set up comes with what you need to hook them up to most any device you want to hear audio from.<br /><br />CHARGING:  The transmitter or base part of the unit has large metal holders on top where you hang the headphones when not in use.  There are metal contacts on the inside top of the headphone head strap that when touching the wire metal holder on thebase unit charge the batteries in the headphones.  There is a red charging light as well as a green on light on the base transmitter unit.  This is very convenient.  There is also a on/off switch on the headphones themselves so one can turn them off when not in use if you happen to not put them on the charger and avoid risking having the batteries run down. The claimed amount of time the headphones can operate between charges is stated at 20-25 hours.  I have not used them long enough without putting them on the charger to find that out for sure yet.<br />The set does come with a pair of NiMh rechargeable AAA batteries which should last a long time taking many charges.  If you do have to replace them ever just remember to get a pair of rechargeable ones.  These will work if you install regular non-rechargeable AAA batteries which one might do in a pinch but if one does so they should remember that one should not attempt to recharge them.<br /><br />RANGE: These operate off radio frequency (the 900MHZ range) and like any radio signal is designed to easily go through walls and most structures.  I live in a 3 story house and have found that range to be pretty accurate.  There is the occasional short burst of static if I am walking though the house wearing them but I rarely have need to do that.<br /><br />INTERFERENCE: Again I only have one other specific 900MHZ item to deal with in the house.  I do however have loads of home theater and computer equipment in the main room I use them in as well as a large air cleaner unit and do not hear interference from any other devices.<br /><br />So I am very happy with this headphone system. For music do they sounds as good as my really expensive over ear Sennheiser headphones with are corded? No. But those are both not wireless and a LOT more expensive and these still have very acceptable quality sound.  Do these have great sound isolation from hearing any other outside noise? No, but in my case there is not a bothersome noisy environment I have to contend with.  If one wishes to have higher fidelity and or better noise isolation or even noise cancelling then perhaps another set of headphones is going to be necessary to fill those requirements.  For me however these have worked out perfect.  Again I paid under $60 for a refurbished set. I have no regrets and have no trouble recommending these just as long as the noise isolation/cancellation feature is not mandatory."
RDPSCJNH4TZTC,5,I purchased these headphones for my father-in-law. He is hard of hearing and would turn his TV up so loud that people in his apartment complex would complain. These headphones took care of that problem.
R3B6X8XNAZR3HV,4,"Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece. Works as advertised. I have had no problems with this device."
R1BN4WG70J5AT0,5,"For a factory refurb this pair of headphones are amazing.  I've had no issues w/ any static and get amazing reception throughout 3 floor of my house....whether i plug it in to my ipod or tv, I have amazing sound quality to the point where it's distracting watching tv because i can hear some of the background sounds such as a clock ticking on the wall!  Can't say enough about them and highly recommend them."
R1Y8GJNSL67JSK,5,These are very well made and the sound quality is excellent.  Good comfort and fit.  You can't go wrong with this product!
R228W6J730RYBM,2,"Although not in the specificatlons or description of the product, it doesn't work with a plasma TV. After working to set it up for over an hour, finally went to the web to find this out."
R31SAWZ2FC2Y3S,4,Bought this item for my 87 year old mother.  It produced good sound quality and was simple enough to use by her.

RBWKCV6PZJXDT,1,"I am disappointed in these headphones. The sound is very sub-standard compared to corded headphones I have had. One of the great benefits of big headphones is getting excellent sound. The RS120 headphones, however, don't come through. Despite their bulk and price, they sound less like good corded headphones and more like the kind of small, cheap headphones they used to give out on airplanes, back before earbuds.<br /><br />The wireless aspect is not well-executed. The headphones have substantial white-noise background hiss, and, at least for me, they work spottily - too frequently requiring cajoling and finagling to get them to work - such as playing with the tuning dial, putting them back on the cradle and taking them back off, unplugging and re-plugging the audio source, etc. Another annoyance: If you pause the music, rather than staying silent, the headphones may start loudly blasting static.<br /><br />On the plus side, these headphones have a visually pleasing design. They also fit well and are lightweight. The plastic dials and switches, however, have a cheap feel.<br /><br />I can't say how these compare to other cordless headphones - but regardless, I do not think these are worth what I paid, approximately $100. If the price came down to $30 or less, they might provide value. But even then, expect a large tradeoff in sound quality for the convenience of going without a cord. Most people would be much better off with corded Sony studio monitor headphones.<br /><br />Part of why I purchased these headphones was the Sennheiser brand, which I have associated in the past with high-end, high quality mics and headphones. These headphones, however, don't fit that reputation."
R2ATG9TZPIN9TU,5,"My husband loves it! I can now listen to music while he goes crazy with his football! :) The best part is that you can have the audio playing on both the headphones as well as the TV - so in case I decide to tune in, I can always increase the TV volume."
RR2RIRYFKWWJE,5,"Our television is fairly close to where my wife writes and works at her desk.  I only watch about 2 hours of news a day, unfortunately during her work times.  The headphones solve any problem of interrupting (or more accurately, infuriating her) when I wear them.<br /><br />They work well...I can walk around the house and still listen.  I haven't found any place where the signal disappears or is distorted.<br /><br />I would recommend them to any of my friends in similar circumstances."
R1VU5WLBWZ2ZZZ,5,"Sound is great, easy to use, very comfortable! Will buy more and would recommend to others. Price went up after we bought but for $63, can't be beat!"
R1UQV6D4I0X5QJ,5,"Granted these were replacing a cheap pair of Best Buy Rocketfish wireless headphones, but needless to say the Sennheisers blew those away. It can take a while to get them tuned in just right with the adjustment knob and depending on various factors they may have be tuned in multiple times. However when they are turned in, they sound great in my opinion and I can be a bit of an audio snob at times. I use them in a room where I have two access points running and that is probably why I have to re-adjust at times."
RCS2P7DTM0ZIP,5,Great for the price. No problems at all with this device. Have been using frequently for over one year now.
R3MRUJQIPBCBIS,5,I love the ear phones.  No more batteries required and I can hear most of the program as long as they don't  speak too quickly.  Hearing and knowing what is being said is not always the same thing.
R1CEDM5NHI3XG3,5,I am able to hear the transmission anywhere within the house (have not tried it outside). Even though the base unit is tucked behind the TV I do not notice any issue with the sound transmission. I have already recomended it to several friends in the community.
RUXOF2OKA3U1A,4,"Ordered this Sennheiser wireless headphone from Amazon. Over a year ago, and it's a good one. Good audio. You'll like it."
RVBKFR3Q84ZJ0,4,"We gave these to my dad who has bad hearing, he wears them so the rest of us don't have to suffer with the volume up high!"
RVBS39PB9FJ9L,4,Not as good as our RS 170 Sennheiser head phones but for the $ good wireless .  We bought these for our 2nd home.
R2PPQ7MOEUOZDO,4,"I purchased this item so that I could listen to the TV while exercising on the treadmill. The set works perfectly and the sound is really great. The only complaint I have is that the headphones appear to be designed for someone with a very large, square head (that is, square from side-to-side, not front-to-back). My own head is relatively round, size 7, and these headphones are very loose and will only stay on as long as my head is upright. However, for the intended purpose, they are just fine."
R9E25Q8UMP1OX,1,"The quality of the sound was terrible, I returned them immediately. Also, although it indicated they were 'ear cups' they didn't really cup over the ear."
R3L3YOZNO9U809,4,Sennheiser  RS120 headphones are virtually static free with very nice sound. They are comfortable enough to watch an  entire 2+ hour movie without being distracting. They also have a very good range. I'm considering another pair for another room. I would (and have)  recommend these headphones to friends.
RJBS03S3WZ97Z,3,"Great range and sound.  I've only had them for a month or so, so I can't comment on thier durability.  So far so good.<br /><br />Revised comment:  My headphones are inoperable now after six months of use.  Not recommended due to durability or lack thereof."
R17JKQ1J6YJKIS,5,"This headphone set is exactely what I was looking for; fidelity of sound without a hugh outlay of dollars. I am very happy with this set and love the easy cradle storage/ charging station.I should have done this eartlier, but was too wrapped up in comparasons.I would reccommend this to everyone."
RZBEMN5DOXX6Q,5,"The wireless headphones arrived quickly.  We found the quality to be true to the description and the positive reviews about it.  The sound is extremely high quality, with no hum or buzz in the background.  Just clear voice. I bought these headphones to replace a different brand which had a constant buzzing.  My husband uses them to be able to hear the TV programs at a higher sound level than I like in the room.  Now he can hear clearly, while the sound is at a normal level for me.  He is completely satisfied with this pair, as they are comfortable to wear, easy to turn on/off.  Being the open style, we still can talk to each other while listening to the programs.  There is no switching to frequencies or tuning in each time, as in the pair he had before.  We both are very satisfied, and recommend the Sennheiser brand highly."
R1TQMIF683HGFC,1,"I ordered this set of Sennheiser RS120 Wireless headphones to use in my new addition sun room.  I tried them out when they came in just to see if they did, in fact, work.  They did, but with some minor background hissing and popping noise.<br />Just now when into my new sun room to watch a movie so not to disturb my wife.  Nothing BUT hissing and popping sounds came from this headset!!  So I used them for about 1 hour when they first arrived and for the second time I've had them on my head, NOTHING!!  And yes, I did try to tune them by changing the setting on both the base and earphone, without any success!!<br />The return window expired in October!!<br />That'll learn me!!  Maybe they'll make a good paper weight??  Sure not good for anything else!!<br /><br />Just get some long wires and plug in the 'Skull-Candies'!! ALOT cheaper, too!!<br /><br />Did I mention that these set on top of (outside)your ears and won't stay on your head if you look down???  Not well designed at all."
R3MNZ1XKE9O7AF,4,"We bought this headset so my husband could enjoy his sports games on TV using the headset, while at the same time allow me to play my own relaxing music throughout out the apartment without the loud noise of basketball or football games. So far has worked well for us."
R3FYDYQ9NPWAST,5,These headphones were just what my husband needed. He can now watch all his favorite shows and movies and understand what is said. He has had 2 sets of TV Ears but says these beat them by far. Clear and full sound.
R3QQD33BA746XI,3,Headset has excellent clarity and gives me a good understanding of words. Fells very comfortable on my head and ears. Negative side- the TUNE switch is almost impossible to adjust. It goes from too low to to one ear only to a tiny spot where both ears can hear then to static and screeching. Terrible to adjust.May be defective. I have given up at times trying to adjust so both ears can hear and just listened with one ear and left the adjustment for another day when my patience was better. Otherwise it seems to be a great product.
R1L9XTKJCGTG3V,5,This product works as advertised - audio quality is good and headphones are comfortable.  Haven't had any issues with it running out of battery; recharger cradle is easy to use.
R1E8QNCGC400OI,5,"live on 3rd floor and washer and dryer one 1st floor.<br />put on the phones to computer music and went all the<br />way to washer dryer on 1st flr. good sound all the way.<br />lil bit of noise on 1st flr but cmon, thats thru 3 floors<br />of concrete. great product!"
R3TQM3TELY1NEG,3,"The head phones have good sound but they fit kind of loose and are warmer than I would like. I bought these for using on elliptical machine, no go, to hot and they slipped down. If you where looking for something to where for short periods of time watching tv they would be ok otherwise I wouldn't recommend them!"
R3PAKG0O420DXN,4,"I bought 2 pairs of these headphones for myself and my parents in 2010. Both have lasted about 2 - 3 years before the headsets gave way.<br />I've had some issues with these headsets over the years, primarily the volume controls stop working and need to be cleaned up some rubbing alcohol.<br />After about 3 years the earphones stop working, the clarity is shot in one set and in other set one earphone has stopped working completely.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />Very sturdy, well built feels solid<br />Easy to charge, put it on top and leave it<br />Good sound clarity - very clear sound, it's not a Bose, but for everyday TV use it's perfect<br />Good battery life, lasts for a very very long time on a single charge (more than 10 hours)<br />Easy to setup, and works with a variety of stereo TV connectors<br />You can add more headset by buying them and selecting the right tuning frequency - EASY as a pie (I bought 2 more headsets HDR 120 for my wife and mom)<br />They use radio technology not infrared, so I can pretty sit anywhere in the room (or house, I roam, e.g. getting dinner or a phone call etc) and it's crystal clear.<br /><br />CON's:<br />My Sony headphone lasted me longer (5 years and still running strong), the earphones tend to die in about 2 years<br />Expensive! - I paid 63 bucks for it in 2010 and now I see its 100 bucks, kinda funny how the pricing is going up for a model that's almost a decade old<br />It's radio tech - if you have heavy radio interference in your area it can sometimes interfere with the sound (happened at my parents house), but usually changing the radio frequency works."
R3H1TZZYQ01MI1,4,"I really like how well these work but do not like the flat ear pads, they tend to fall forward while running on the treadmill. If they cupped the ear they would fit better. They are kinda wide on me anyway and with the flat surface they don't feel secure. They have great range and are clear. I use them upstairs and watch the TV downstairs and can hear everything just fine."
R2WLE935PGW37L,5,"I recently purchased Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle. I did so because I am 83 years old and have moderate hearing loss in both ears and had almost given up on being able to understand TV audio. This was most pronounced with British and other non-American accents and whispered conversations. On receipt of the product I found it easy to set up with the clear instructions that were provided. Most importantly, for me, the results have been amazing.  I can hear and understand all the audio almost perfectly, my interest in TV programs is renewed, and TV-watching is now pleasurable rather than frustrating. The product also appears to be well-made, and I really like the design of the charging cradle, i.e., nothing to plug in, just hang it on the cradle. For me, the price was -- and is -- well worth it.  I give it a grade of five stars PLUS, and I highly recommend it.  Thanks for providing it.  Wally Tubell"
R1LYAS9I88HQ0L,5,it was a gift i personally have not used them but the reciepient who recieved them said they are great
RMDWU6PS3TQ0A,5,I love this product! My husband has always watched TV with the volume so loud I can even think. After listening to screaming children all day I just want silence. So I bought him these cordless noise canceling headphones so he can listen as loud as he wants and I don't have to!! This has saved my sanity time 10!!
R315ULL06LIZBX,5,"My wife ordered these for me through her account. I had need of them as it seemed that we could hear the TV louder anywhere in our place than in front of the TV. I really love these because the batteries in the headphones charge on the base and the base has a power adapter and does not need a battery of its own. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods. As they rest on ear and not around the ear this is important. Just do not bend over as they will slide right off. As for sound these are well worth the money. I have been using them for two weeks now. Everything I have watched is superior to what I used to hear from my TVs speakers. There is just so much more to the sound. Football games are really something. It is like having surround sound speakers. They place you right in the stadium. From fireworks, to the announcers, to stadium announcers, bands crowd noise. Everything you would expect is there and coming from all directions. The sounds sound like they are in a stadium. There are qualities to the sound in everything that I have watched that I have never noticed before. And these are the lower cost headphones of this maker. Makes me wonder what the higher priced ones sound like. As is these are well worth the money and I highly recommend them. Very easy set up as well."
R2Y84VJPGY513A,3,I've had 2 of the RS 120's and the base unit has gone out on both.  One after 2 yrs. and the other after 3 weeks.  However I haven't found any other brands with as good performance.  I've upgraded to the RS140 so I'll see how long that lasts.
R11MA9E961MYBM,1,"Despite the largely good reviews, these headphones are awful.  There is a constant, distracting hiss, and no amount of fiddling with the tuning dial helps, it only makes it worse.  It is the same on all three channels and with different input devices.  And a range of over 300 feet?  Try 20 feet.  The only way to be happy with these headphones is to keep your expectations very low.<br /><br />I originally forgot to mention the extremely loud static when the headphones don't find, or lose, a sound signal.  Ouch!<br /><br />News update.  The left channel stopped working after four months.  Complete junk."
R2AYVRP7L74MTM,5,Not sure if I bought these for me or my dad. My elderly father was turning the TV up so loud I could hear it all over the house. Drove me crazy. Got these for him for father's day and now he can enjoy TV all day long and I can enjoy peace and quiet. Yea! He also likes to be able to walk around the house and still be able to listen to the TV. We both love them. Highly recommend them.
RTGWHJ2NIBBEY,3,"I bought these headphones as a good compromise between something *really* expensive, and something really cheap.  For the price, they deliver a very good sound.  I'm not going to go into the sound so much, as there are plenty of reviews for that, but a few things I did find were that I concur with other reviewers that there is some interference/static.  I don't have to go very far in my house to start hearing slight static noises, especially if I go into another room.  Normally I wear these if I'm doing housework, or vacuuming, and walking around causes some annoying static.  Not enough to ruin the listening experience, but more than I want.  Also, these are uncomfortable on my head.  The ear cups are flat, not cupped, and when they are on my ears, part of it presses against my jawbone near my ear, causing discomfort after just a few minutes of use.  I was going to return them for this problem, but I find that if I turn them around, the shape of them holds them off my jawbone.  It looks funny, and there the sound is not as rich as if they were fully cupped on my ears, but it's the only way I can wear them comfortably.  Even still, as with most headphones I've found, they get uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing (they are not very light).<br /><br />Overall, I bought these for the wireless ability, and they work very well for that (even with some static issues).  But as a set of headphones (if they were wired), they are not that great, not ergonomic (for my head) and not very light."
R2RAIAYX6QOFNT,3,"Bought this RS120 Wireless Headphone to use with TV in replacement of older RS140 model no longer made. Works great as long as the fingers doing the volume adjustment on the headphone don't mix up the volume button with the tuning button just below it. When that happens, the channel is lost and is refound only with frustrating fumbling. Also, this model is much more susceptible to interference (and/or mis-tuning) than the RS140. It works great for what it's for--in our case, enabling one TV watcher to set personal volume without blasting the rest, and allowing that watcher to roam the house while listening to the TV. Highly recommended for the young and nimble-fingered, not so much for those who have trouble remembering not to touch the bottom button when adjusting the volume."
RDG008SNQBKDZ,5,"My husband and I have had one of these for two years, and have loved it.  Thoughtlessly, we thought it had died, so purchased a second one.  As it turned out, the battery had died, so all we had to do was change the battery and wouldn't have needed one, but now we have one for each of us!  No regrets.  The dial on the side of the earpiece lets us now tune in either of two televisions sets we may have running simultaneously (news and a football game, maybe?)  It also has clear tone while we're outside.  It's perfect for us."
RNT9VH7TJO27P,1,I took this product out of the box & plugged it in. It would not power up. I returned it immediately for a refund.
R3JZT2TTMJETXS,2,The unit works great... until it shuts off 3 minutes later! The Sennheiser website says that the output level of the TV (or whatever else you plugged it into) is too low. Not true! The headphones work just fine while it lasts. I plugged them into the cable box and they worked fine without interruption. But there is nothing wrong with the TV audio output! Poor engineering.
REK41JFRPV7J,5,"I purchased this headset in order to avoid disturbing my wife as she works on various projects that require a great deal of silence and concentration. I have been considering the purchase of wireless headphones for more than a year. I bought at least two other brands and returned them for lack of performance. The pair I bought prior to purchasing the Sennheiser RS120 used an infrared signal technology. The sound was good, but the unit had almost no range at all. You needed to be within ten feet of the TV with an almost direct line-of-sight position in front of the set. Even raising my hand to my mouth while eating, caused interference as I moved my hand pass the set to my mouth. The Sennheiser with its radio frequency technology is excellent. I can leave the room and go to the most remote area of our 2000 sq. ft. house and still receive excellent reception. The unit not only has excellent reception, it also blocks out extraneous noise such as a blender, garbage disposal or running water while I continue to listen to the audio while in the kitchen. The headset also allows me to hear sound details that are not noticeable when listening without the headphones. It's also very easy to adjust the volume without removing the headset. However, I have not experienced any loss of volume or clarity while listening from the most remote end of our house.<br /><br />The unit is also adjustable to various head sizes and is very comfortable to wear. The ear pads can be easily removed and replaced. The quality of these headphones is excellent and the price was very, very reasonable. This device has met all my expectations and then some."
R28SD9ZMA829BX,3,"After about a year, the right ear stopped working, but being mostly deaf in the right ear, I really didn't notice for awhile. heavy with a noticable hiss. But mainly got it for TV watching. Good enough"
R1ONDNHUDMIOZ1,5,"I have none of the problems with this headset that other reviewers have claimed.  I use it to listen to the TV without disturbing my wife when she is trying to sleep.  When she tried it, she wanted one too, so she could hear the programs better.  Now we both have one."
R26SVCCNEWP82Z,1,"This product stopped working after about 2 months.  Return window expired, so I am at the mercy of Amazon.  This is an example of how moving production to China makes buyers reviews useless -- manufacturer's name and model stay the same, quality plummets.  IMO, Amazon should introduce \\""Not made in China\\"" search tag."
RP2GDXWGIRGN9,4,"I bought these headphones so I could watch tv without bothering my girlfriend at night while she slept.  They work really good!  The sound is decent and volume can be adjusted at the headphone set while the tv volume can also be adjusted independently and at the same time (hooking up the headphone set doesn't automatically mute the tv so this gives you flexibility if multiple people want to watch or listen to something at different volumes).  The only negative I've found are in the fit of the headphones.  They're comfortable and lightweight but don't stay on real well if you lean forward or backwards.  For me this isn't a problem since I just wear them in bed but if you were planning on wearing these while doing activities, you might want to find another headphone set that fits tighter.  Overall I would say they do the job and are decent for what I need them for.  I haven't tested the range but they give crystal clear sound from where I'm at, 20ft away."
R3LOJIO2DHPNBC,5,"Bought this item because my friends bought it. It is very nice and convenient for listening tv, while doing something around the house. If you want to use while exersizing I recomend to put it on above the bandana for not sliding. Good sound quality and light weight."
R1CLZYD0S1PFE2,5,"I have difficulty understanding speech in BBC productions like \\""Sherlock\\"" and have to ask my wife frequently \\""what did he say?\\""  After reading all the reviews, I picked Sennheiser because of their reputation for making excellent aviation and audio headphones.  I am very happy with them; the set-up is ridiculously easy and the sound quality is fantastic.  I can't hear any hiss during quiet passages, but I have the input level set at a reasonably high level.  The biggest surprise is how far I can go from the source and still get perfect reception.  Walls and foundations don't seem to make any difference; perfect for listening to a football game while working in the shop.  As happy as I am with this product, my wife is even happier because when I'm using them, she can set the TV volume at her comfortable leve and I don't have to ask what was just saidl.  I have worn them to watch two movies back to back and didn't run the battery down but I have no idea how long the rechargeable battery would really last.  The charging stand works great and serves as the perfect place to store them when not in use.<br />I had one puzzling event with these headphones; my father is in assisted living and has a pretty severe hearing deficit such that he is unable to understand speech on TV.  I thought I'd let him try them out to see if they improved his comprehension level like they do for me.  When I hooked them to his TV, there was a very loud and annoying interference.  No matter how carefully I tuned them, I couldn't get rid of the interference enough to be able to make out any speech.  I don't know what is causing the problem in his assisted living residence, but they worked beautifully again when I got them home.  I would agree with some of the other reviews that the tuning and volume controls are pretty close together and I don't think my father would be able to operate them because he has diminished sensation in his finger and can't do fine adjustments."
R1R1646EZZLSIL,5,I actually bought these headphones because I don't want to bother anybody when watching TV because I do like to have volume really up. And it does its job!. Although the sound it is not amazing (which is understandable because it is Radio Frecuency) it is very very good.<br />it is very comfortable and it's not even hard to wear it for hours.<br />Besides It's got an amazing range. Around 30 mts. according to my tests.<br /><br />I just have to say IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT and I'd buy it again. Highly Recommended if you are just looking for Descent Sound.
R1O2ZQCCTJ3VCZ,2,Missing NiMH AAA Batteries. I will not return this order until I buy batteries and try it out. New batteries cost about as much as shipping it back.  Right now I am disappointed about the delay in putting the product to use and the level of quality control in assembling the shipment.  OOPS.  I found them in the hidden compartment.<br />I will modify my review after checking it out.
R1OA5RWWED4TGF,4,Good Sound reception.  Need to move signal locater to the side where the on/off switch is. Too close to Volume control and easy to turn wrong control.
R2473SWVBVI9G,5,"excellent product- I use these headphones when I'm on my treadmill to better hear the TV and not have to blast the volume because of the treadmill noise- They work perfectly- clear audio, no static- great product"
R2CFF1V04K4Q16,5,"This is my first review on any product. I have to say, without any doubt, these headphones are the best I have ever owned. I have NO negative comments. It's all positive. Reception is great. Clarity is great. Price was great. And as far as some of you out there complaining about the interference that you may or may not be getting, I'll tell you this. IT'S CORDLESS!!.. IT'S GONNA HAVE INTERFERENCE SOME TIMES... not always and it's not constant.. It just happens... ANYTHING that sends or receives an electronic signal will, from time to time, get signal interruption or static interference... it's the nature of the beast. Even your remote control will receive interference. You just don't know it. My opinion is.... they're incredible and I would definitely tell my friends to buy them."
R24SE1IDZ169YF,5,"Headphones were exactly as described. The way you charge the headphones is very convenient, just place them on the wire holder. When the red light comes on you are charging.<br /><br />Volume is plenty loud enough but keeps me from cranking to a head ringing level. Great sound depending on the source.<br /><br />Would purchase again."
R2PKD9JOH5G1KW,5,"Bought these to replace TV Ears - the RS120's are vastly superior and much less expensive to boot. RS120's battery charge lasts at least twice as long, plus they are easily replaceable AAA NiMH rather than special order batteries. The range is much greater and does not require line of sight. Sound quality is much better. TV Ears plastic tips were constantly breaking and needing replacement. I can't think of a reason anyone would choose TV Ears over these Sennheiser's."
R11DYOKFQD8HIA,5,Excellent quality that includes a very good stereo surround type audio.  Great product. Far better quality for less money than TV Ears.
R3JELOCDU2KZCU,5,"Very happy with the product. Good sound. Good range. If the signal is super quiet, it can somewhat annoyingly try to boost it, but more often than not, this is actually a good thing, so no real complaints here."
RHZL4AI6SGEX4,5,Well worth the search and the price.  Excellent set of headphones that are static free with little or no interference.  Direct communication with the Manufacturer's Engineers (email) answered all my questions on the product before my purchase.  Very courteous and responsive manufacturer of quality electronic equipment in all price ranges. Don't settle for name brand middle of the road headphones. Quality and dependability are worth every penny invested in this manufacturer's  products.  Would recommend anytime.<br /><br />Thomas Lee
R159XMCTMQ2RHM,1,"My wife and I will use these to listen to books / TV shows through a Kindle fire while rocking our newborn to sleep. I was very excited to cut the cable, since it is tricky to manage with a little one snoozing in your arms. However, the base would only keep the input signal for an hour or so and then disconnect. The headphones still worked, the base charging light still went on, but the green signal light went out, and so did the audio.<br /><br />Because of all the great reviews I figured we must have got an odd error, so I exchanged them, but the next set had the same problem."
RI1ODUR2RAWEW,5,"This is the 3rd pair is wireless headphones I have owned in the past 10 years, all \\""top-of-line\\"". They just wore out. This is by far the best. Amazing bass, comfort and ease of use. They even look good sitting on the charger.<br />Charging is just easy. Sit the heat phones on the charger and let it do its thing. No fuss, no muss."
R2CBXKXD3ONS0V,5,"I had these up soon after arrival. I couldn't get them working using the audio out jacks, but by using the provided adaptor I plugged into the headphone jack and they headphones work perfectly! Very comfortable on the head and clear sound quality - exceeds my expectations."
R1ODALDXCJ6JZP,5,Headphones work great. Wife no longer has to interpret what is being said on the TV.  I would certainly recommend it for anyone who has difficulty hearing the TV.
RO895GD1N8HNX,5,"Theses headphones are by far the best that I have ever owned and I will never buy another brand...great sound great quality hours of use,spent way to much money on other products that never work glad I bought this one for sure."
R1KQKMTQCZPCJ9,5,"I've had these for almost 10 months now, and saw that I neglected to write a review. I'm glad I didn't. Up until recently, I had to have the base station in a certain place, and got pretty bad interference whenever I moved my head when listening to music. It got to the point where I'd more often than not reach for my HD203s (I'm not a Sennheiser nut, I just liked the 203s so much I splurged for these).<br /><br />Rearranging my workspace has allowed me to place the base away from whatever was causing the interference (most likely a speaker) and now these things rock me so hard. If you're looking for an immersive experience, like with noise-cancelling cups, you won't get it here. These are flat pads that really don't block out any exterior noise. However the range is really good, I can go outside and cut my grass and still get acceptable sound. They aren't the absolute most comfortable things, but then again I have sensitive external ears."
R3I6ZLFHDO3F7U,2,"Easy connect, okay sound but very uncomfortable. Worst of all, whenever I bend over or look down they fall off. Kind of like that pair of glasses that keep sliding down your nose. While there is an length adjustment there is no width adjustment."
R3A49B44U6NHBM,5,"Great  product.  Excellent sound and very comfortable to wear.  I'v tried others, but I found this brand to be superior to the others."
R1YZZ822BSFSVF,1,"The product is excelent, but this refurbished option only work for a day for me. The Cradle went off and never recovered."
RCC5NSUXQAYQU,4,The sound works great and not affected by your head's orientation to transmitter.  The sound even works when I go to another room at the other end of the house.  I am unable to get a comfortable fit with the headphones on my head. No adjustments.  They fall off when I bend over.  They have flat surface and not cupped on the ear pieces.  Other headphones I have are far more comfortable.  Shipping was fast.
R6H1A2ITX23O7,3,Excelent audio quality with great wireless reach for a reasonable prize; unfortunately the headphones are not as comfortable as expected.
R1CQO2IS86CC89,3,"Excellent Sound, you can actually walk quite a distance and not loose the sound. Buyer beware these headsets are no longer working with the latest Digital technology of TV's and cable Co. You will need to also buy $50 Digital to Analog Decoder if your TV does not at least have Audio out (red/White) plugs. The TV needs to be able to transfer the Digital input to analog output for the Sennheiser  headsets to work . This sadden us as we have purchased 4 set of these for ourselves and family. It Seems Sennheiser needs to UPDATE they're headset to current Technology."
RZX27NGZYL8TT,4,"Okay, I am not an audiophile so I am not going to describe bass levels and the rest of the hokum that 95% of people shopping for this product don't care about.  These headphones, for the price, are great.  If you have a small space, children, spouse who goes to bed early, these are perfect for watching TV without disturbing anyone.  Also, because they are headphones, you actually hear the sound much better than from your regular TV and you really don't need to crank the volume very loud so as to risk damaging your hearing.<br /><br />LAYMAN ALERT::  If you have a digital TV, (which if you don't at this point,what are doing shopping for wireless headphone-you SHOULD be shopping for a flat screen) you will need a few products.  Order a Toslink cable, about a $1.50ish a digital to analog audio converter ($5ish)."
R3V6RY40EA3Y9M,4,Good sound - easy tuning<br />Ear pads inadequate - my ears hurt after a while.color is a nice black.<br />Stand for recharging is cool
R2UQIFD6D52R40,4,The product arrive in a timely manner in good condition.<br />The sound is good however once in a while when the connected device is off or possibly out of range there is a loud hiss.<br />Overall the product lives up to it's name.
R33QPZ3E4XDJID,4,have the better mod 130 for my living room needed something in basement when i'm on treadmill so i can hear tv better only draw back was i thought they were over ear but they are on ear but that's ok for my use and the price was wright
R3BZBHVCJK9ZME,1,"It may be a good product, but I could not get it to work. I previously had used TV Ears but they only last for maybe a year. So I had high hopes for the Sennheiser, but I don't think the transmitter was sending anything. I returned it to Amazon who paid for return shipping and refunded my payment. I haven't replaced the unit with anything yet (not much available) so may eventually order another Sennheiser RS-120."
R3RRGK76PUGJXK,2,I've been in touch with customer service multiple times and no one can explain why these won't charge. I bought them for my husband's birthday and he hasn't been able to use them at all.
RICDXA5H647QM,1,"We purchased this product for a hearing disabled lady and it has been nothing but trouble. It doesn't charge without fussing around, the batteries always go dead - very quickly - and now there is static that is just random and is uncomfortable. All of this happened after the 30 day return policy, so we are stuck with a very expensive product that will not work. They are very fragile and the least amount of movement shakes the batteries out of contact so it was fine if she wore them and didn't ever move. Now, they just will not charge and work without the nasty static. Not at all a reliable product."
RVLFQVKLSDYHG,3,"Pros<br />-solid construction<br />-above average audio quality<br />-aesthetically pleasing mounting/recharge dock<br />-good battery life<br />-replaceable rechargeable batteries<br />-comfortable even during prolonged use<br /><br />Cons<br />-only comes with R/L audio cables.  Most newer tv's only have optical output so you may need to buy an adapter.<br />-slight background buzzing at times<br />-they are bulky, so if you like to lay on your side while watching tv, it may cause a problem<br /><br />Overall I like these, and I would have given them a four out of five it they had an adapter for optical audio outputs."
R263IN6RLINOY3,4,"Contrary to some other reviews, I find the sound excellent. Not only is is better fidelity with noticeably better base than a cheaper brand I'm replacing, this set had almost no noise at all. In fact, when the TV is not playing any sound, I can't even tell if the headphones are on without checking the switch.<br /><br />The batteries and standard AAA rechargeable, with enough juice to last for days between charges, and easy and quick to replace. I have no trouble at all getting the headphones onto the holder, though it is worth visually checking the indicator light to make sure they are charing. (This is a simple electrical contact charger. The contacts are recessed in the headband.<br /><br />The only drawbacks: Slightly less comfortable than the old cheap set. I prefer the push button power switch on the old cheap set to the slide switch on these--but as long as it lasts, it's just preference.<br /><br />I would really like it if the charger stand and the transmitter were two separate units. That would cost a litter more, but since the whole point is remote wireless, it's kind of silly to have to get up and walk over to the TV to set them on the charger.<br /><br />I like 'em though, and would buy them again."
RXVSD06WQ4AWC,1,"No matter what I do ( and I have read the other reviews on how to mitigate the static ) I get constant static. When you set them up properly, you will still notice static on the lows.  Every thing I listen to goes up and down, Death metal, dubstep, epic classical, and the static is never gone. I sit less than 3 feet from my receiver.  Absolute waste of money!<br /><br />These are my first wireless headphones, so maybe I'm being too harsh or maybe I'm just and audiophile. (but then again they don't fit half as comfortable as my sennheiser 350s and they look ridiculous)"
R1QM1S6QOUSZ2U,4,"Now these are not audiophile headphones. Not to say they don't sound good. They do. Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again. When playing audiophile quality don't expect them to perform like your speakers (if they are a good set) But you can also expect good quality sound for the price - They do the job."
R30NB57UQTC8K6,4,I received the headphones in a timely manner and am happily surprised at how good they worked. The headphones put out a clear crisp sound and I can go anywhere in my house and still hear my tv. No fading or cut out at all. I am extremely pleased with these headphones.
RJG2SKS8RHO7C,4,"I love these phones.  They are very good, but alas, they are not perfect.  The sound quality is very good.  And so is the reception range.  Sennheiser is one of the best names in headphones.  This wireless headphone did not disappoint. The only gripe I have is that it is very easy for the phones to slip off of my head, especially if I tilt the head.  The phone is kept on the head and the ears entirely by friction, and that is why it is so easy for it to slip.  I wish the phones were the enclosed, over the ear type, so that it is far less easy for the phones to slip.  I know Sennheiser specializes on open, over the ear type phones instead of the enclosed over the ear designs favored by its rival AKG. If I did not get this pair at such a low price, I definitely would consider returning it, even though I am giving it 4 stars and I love its sound quality and performance.  Would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact that it tends to slip off.  If I am not careful and I wear these phones while I bend down to clean the toilet, these phones would likely end up getting dunked into the toilet bowl."
R3FPXDG1K7X8HC,4,The headphones were delivered very quickly.  The quality and function of the merchandise was as described in the summary.  The sound is clear and distinct.  I was very satisfied with purchase.
R347SROHQCD710,5,"It's an FM tuning device, so sometimes you can hear a bit injection. But other than that, the sound quality is gorgeous.This product is worth the price!"
RS4RB3Y3M6O9X,4,"I got the headset for my wife,she likes the voice quality,&the recharge stand. but it does not muff out enough outside sound,& are a little big for her head. She said she could live with that. We both agree the product is very good in quality & price."
R1SQ2S12SWDQPM,2,"I really, really wanted this to work. I even bought two headsets, thinking that these would be the solution to our t.v. problems. Unfortunately, the headphones have analog sound jacks and are incompatible with my new t.v.s that have only digital audio outputs (they have analog inputs, though). I went to an electronics store to find out if a digital audio output adapter exists, but the guy looked at me like I was nuts. I had to return both headsets and am still searching for a solution (maybe bluetooth)."
R2ELMCQ4JIM9CD,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser  RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]] The Sennheiser RS120 is performing quite well and I would recommend it to other potential customers. Unlike, however, the old wired Sennheiser I purchased many years ago it did not have a button that would enhance bass; that at least psychologically was an attractive feature. But that my ears are also 79 years old might also be a considered factor."
RR1UO8LOX5I8,5,"I started having trouble hearing the dialogue on TV programs, especially the newer weekly series. Most of these productions seem to need continual music or background noise to that almost drowns out the dialouge...also a lot of them are very bass with the voices. I shopped around the internet and I kept running into the Sennheiser R120 product which continuall recieved 4 or 5 stars. So, I ordered one.<br />I must confirm with a resounding YES, it is all that and more. this is a great product for the cost!"
R1VPMP8PZJ7OWU,5,These headphones get the job done.  I own two sets and I am totally satisfied. I enjoy viewing and hearing sporting and musical  events without disturbing others in the household. They have taken a lot of the stress off my marriage.
RRCVMXKUS7D0H,4,"The RS120 is my second set of wireless Sennheiser headphones which I use to watch TV. Both have the same sometimes very irritating design flaw.  When I am wearing them, if I bend my body over, e.g., to pick up something from the floor, they slide off my head.  It has nothing to do with audio performance but it is a vexing problem, expecially when I have something in both hands. I think there is a simple solution they could implement.<br /><br />Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with these headphones."
R1U9RD4553RUWG,1,"I've been a huge fan of these and have a set I bought sometime in 2008. I purchased a second set more recently in 2012, and was extremely disappointed to find that they've changed the headphones to a much more uncomfortable design.<br /><br />My earlier set has an over-the-ear setup, where the headphones have a very comfortable padded perimeter about 12mm thick and 8mm deep, holding the speaker back from your ears. However the newer set I bought, the padding is not offset from your ear, but rather a flat surface with fabric that flexes to your ear rather than being offset by any padding. I'm finding the new set with stretchable fabric pretty uncomfortable.<br /><br />Older model with offset speaker padding -- 5 stars.<br />Newer model with stretching-fabric and no offset -- 1 star."
RS8K5F2TN9JMO,1,"I bought this a week ago, I was surprised by the sheer number of 5 star reviews, and didnt bother reading the 1  star reviews. After setting up the product, I just couldnt get rid of the static, even after going through the numerous tips and tricks given by various members on Amazon. The static just wouldnt stop, and the frequent crackles and pops was just too frustrating. If you're an audiophile and would like the minimum of what could be defined as a clear sound, dont buy this. What a waste, I'm sending it back today."
R2NIB7BO34CMNN,5,"These headphones were just what we needed in our small house, where one person might be watching TV while another is reading a book, sleeping, etc.  They are very comfortable and worked right out of the box.  I was a little concerned that they would be complicated to use on our tv, but they are really simple.  Just plug into the audio out jack, turn the volume on the TV down and enjoy!"
RRTVOCWZP1LZ6,2,"We got this headset with high expectations as we heard that it is a great item for my mothers TV watching and her very bad hearing.  But it is not compatible with our flatscreen (2009) Panasonic TV, and we have been trying (Best Buy, Radio Shack) since we bought the headset (August 23) to find a convertor that will make it work.  We now have had something thru a hard core electronics store, that Panasonic told us to get, on order for 3 weeks and it still hasn't come in!  Oh, my poor mother!!<br />It would have been good to have know ahead of time what one would need to purchase to make the headset work with the most popular TV sets, so we wouldn't have to go thru this."
R1NTQ51YI4G7BZ,4,"Overall the headphones work as advertised. The only negative is that they have to be \\""secured\\"" to the charging cradle or the contacts will not connect so that they can be charged. We used a large rubber band.For $75, I would have expected something better in that regard."
R2D72P5FCH9EWF,5,Excellent Product.  I have been enjoying peace and quiet while the wife or grandchild watch and listen to their favorite TV programs with their headphones on.
R17J6J29ZFCNVA,1,It was crippled on arrival (only one earphone would work) and within 20 minutes it was completed dead (I am guessing the transformer was defective) Sent back today.. I am such a fan of Amazon return policies and practices.
R3TC34ENQ1KACG,5,These headphones are perfect! I am a full-time college student who has a lot of reading to do. My husband is an avid tv watcher. The noise from the tv decreases my level of concentration on my reading. These headphones let my husband watch tv and allow me to read in the same room. They work really well. We actually have to go into the tv's settings and shut the tv's speakers off in order for the headphones to work. I have been pleased with the product ever since we finally figured this out!
R3LIZS4KQYH6JW,1,"When no audio is playing, there is a horrible hum. Also falls off your head easily.<br /><br />Otherwise it is fine. Will not be using these for any longer"
R3KQFI5KWTGEJI,3,"I was given these as a gift and they were purchased on amazon.<br />I was given these because I am a disaster when it comes to things with cords, especially headphones. The sound quality is amazing but not worth the awful fit. Unless you sit upright and sit still they move horrible and constantly fall off. And after awhile there is a buzz that does not go away."
R26P8SQBJ68BIE,5,"We have been using these headphones for quite a few years now, and just had to replace one pair because they finally broke. They are especially great at night time for after the Kids go to bed. The clarity of them is awesome once you have the frequency set up correctly.  I especially like them for movies, I always find that the music in movies is too loud and am constantly changing volume between speaking parts and music parts, however when we use the headphones we don't have to do that at all, they make it easy to enjoy a movie. Highly recommend this item (we have 3 sets in our house)"
R3N8KIW99R0JDW,3,"The Sennheiser RS120 is of limitted use to me for the following reason (not its fault): When I plug the RS120 into the audio output of my TV, it mutes the TV speakers. I was hoping to be able to listen via the RS120 Earphones while other people in the room be able to listen normally via the TV peakers.<br />I do not know how to stop the muting. The issue is of course with the TV not the Sennheiser.<br />If you have a solution, please inform me.<br />Thanks,<br />Pnina"
R2GOU0XTOK9UQS,4,"Sennheiser is a good product.  Have two sets and am very pleased. I have to add more words. This is nonsense, and a waste of my time."
RFJ1ATROK1ABW,5,"Headphone is very comfortable, has a great range and allows me to listen to TV & Stereo at my hearing level needs without upsetting the rest of the household.  Greatly satisfied so far."
R37M2EO0ZVKF12,2,I Purchased Sennheiser wireless headphones because I thought they were of good quality. Sound  quality was not so great but ok. There was small hiss at low volume but It was ok until I faced big jolt when one of the speaker stopped working only after 6 months. I used this headphone very less frequent and very properly.    It is a real shock for me because I was getting a cheap RF headphone for $15 but I purchased  this for quality. Now I am out of US and I cannot even claim warranty.    Total waste of Money. Really want to give negative Ratings. Not expected from Sennheiser.    Update:   I found service center of Sennheiser and they replaced it. Also after some time charger stopped working. They replaced it too.    Still giving two star because this quality is not expected from Sennheiser.
R3GIKZ5T4L2XE7,5,"Did a lot of research on wireless headphones.  I used TV ears before but the transmitter went bad and they are to expensive so I was looking for a better product that did not cost a lot of money.  Stumbled upon this and did reseach, for the price it was the best deal so I took a chance.  I am very pleased, they work great, the sound quality is not as good as my Bose headphones but it is very good and works great.  I set this up with my new 50 inch Samsung Plasma, first through the cable box...no problem, then I bought an optical adapter and attached it to the back of the tv again no problem.  Best part is I can walk around the house with the headphones on and still hear the tv it does not lose the signal like my tv ears.  Great product, good price, and it works."
R31V5MQA0MZVPH,2,"Makes constant hissing sound in the ear, and often it is quite painful. Have tried all kinds of frequency tuning but never got rid of the noise. Going to return the item."
R2Q3AAW3YMIVNR,4,Sennheiser RS 120 has a great sound- I can walk throughout the house  even to the backyard and still hear without any degradation in sound quality
R1QRCF6J3D1LT9,1,"I bought these headphones in late 2011 and a few weeks back they stopped working.  The base unit does not show any of the status lights (charge, on/off) working.  Since this is still under warranty I contacted Deal Zone for a copy of the bill with the serial number of the device on it (Sennheiser will not repair the unit for free without this kind of a bill) - I am still waiting to hear from Deal Zone.  Do not buy from Deal Zone, buy from any other place that would give you a bill with the serial number, otherwise its almost a $100 (price when I bought it) down the drain."
RG2LOZN25K4QL,2,"I bought these specifically so my wife could listen to the TV without disturbing me. The constant underlying hum is so bad that they are unusable. Before sending them back, I decided to give them a couple of days trial using them instead with my computer, listening to music as I worked, just to see if they were worth keeping even though my original intention was lost. The sound quality when used with the computer was very good. However, the power cord to the charging dock failed within two days and the headset stopped transmitting. Why are the majority of modern products so much better looking yet work so poorly these days? The packaging has gotten better and better but the concept of quality seems to have gone right out the window."
R2SWZR6184Z1IV,5,"Owners manual not all that helpful regarding the powering up and illumination of the green light but item was/is good.  Only real complaint is that headset was much too tight on my head, requiring me to carefully spring the headband to fit my head.  My concern in doing so was that I might break some plastic or wiring. This went well, no damage.  I like it and recommend it!"
R3CV6XYWJVTQ9Q,3,"I'll start with the positive. For wireless rechargeable headphones they are a great value, sound quality is acceptable, range is phenomenal, and battery life is good.<br /><br />On the negative side I interpreted \\""Over-Ear\\"" as around ear and not on ear. Occasionally there will be static bursts, but not enough to be annoying just noticeable. The largest drawback I have is that the ear pads don't have enough padding, so for prolonged use there is discomfort.<br /><br />I'll end with they are great for sitting, but with any movement over walking they will fall off easily so don't expect to be doing any activity with them on."
R4VLWE50QEYX6,2,"First, the good news:  The sound has a rich quality for this price.  Plus with a full charge, the batteries last several hours and the signal reaches at least one room away (even thru a wall) from the transmitter.<br /><br />Now the problems:  1) The headset is too large with no ability to adjust the size; it wants to fall off if you bend forward. 2) The fine tune control is extremely touchy.  Getting both channels to equalize into great stereo separation takes patience as the correct position on the control is very narrow.  Many times just bumping the headset throws it off.  3) The volume control is not a simple \\""up or down\\"" procedure.  As one adjusts the volume the sound fluctuates between staying clear and becoming fuzzy and crackly.  Cleaning the controls have had only minimal improvements.  I must admit that when the headphones were brand new, the problems were not as profound, but after +/- 6 months the problems progressively worsened.<br /><br />Once you have attained the balance and volume to your liking, it sounds great.  BUT BE PATIENT!"
R1KPNMLRY8VGKI,4,received this item in excellent shape.this company uses the proper shipping materials. I use the headphones at least 7 consecutive hours 5 days a week and the reception overall is very good. it has never lost it's charge and the charging base work perfectly.If you bend or jerk your head it slips off your head. You could fix that. I also feel the ear piece material abit itch-ee. You could use a different kind of material. I would recommend this product overall.
RA5TDP1Z9R9FE,5,"This product overall is fantastic, the sound and quality are exceptional. The only thing I would like to see is if the ear muffs were curled more to fit my ears and not slide so much. I would recommend this product highly to people who are hard of hearing, it works great!"
RAPVO69QUGOPY,5,"The Sennheiser (Model RS 120) earphones purchased from Amazon are excellent. My wife and I must have earphones to enjoy television. These were replacements for earphones that had become worn and torn. We are delighted with the quality of sound, the feel, the light weight, and the convenience of the new phones. They have an \\""on-off\\"" switch that was not available on our old set."
R3GIVFAIN69FD1,5,"The Sennheiser Wireless headphone works great.  The sound is clear, finding a good channel is easy, and the distance is acceptable but could be better."
R28FYW3PGBCIYN,5,These headphones have great fidelity and range.  The charging cradle is very convenient.<br />The volume control on the earphones makes it convenient.  I can turn them up as loud as I want while others in the room can listen at a lower volume.  The only con I have is that the charging light never goes out even when the headphones are fully charged.
RRY5BZIT24KI1,4,"This is a replacement for the TV Ears. It is less expensive, more sturdy and sounds better than TV ears. It comes with two AAA rechargable batteries. I watch a lot of TV, and the batteries have always worked after hanging up the earphones when not in use. TV ears earphones exhaust power faster, so I purchased a second pair to continue use.Sennheiser is not as comfortable, being somewhat more bulky, but not uncomfortable.  Sound quality is probably not as good as a pair one could use for listening to a DVD, but for TV, they are fine."
R3FR28PS72GA4O,4,I bought the Sennheiser Headphones so that I would be able to listen to audio without disturbing my wife.  What I hadn't anticipated is the ability to go from room to room and still hear high quality sound from the selected source.  My wife no longer complains about my music; now she complains that I am not listening to her.
R2S3D707QE0KD,5,"I bought these earphones to replace some old Radioshack ones which had stopped working. I watch Netflix streaming video alot, which has no subtitles.  I am totally deaf in one ear and have moderate to severe hearing loss in the other. These headphones have a clearer sound than my old ones. Easy to install, and adjust for clarity. The self charger is nice too. Very pleased with them."
RZIXFECQDPHEN,2,"This was my first wireless headphone. And it last for 35 min, before packaging it back and requesting a refund from amazon.<br /><br />So, it does have a nice charging feature, but it stops there. The manual tuning is horrible. Remember the old radios from the 80's? That's how you are suppose to tune this thing. It's very sensitive, leaving no room for mistakes. I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound. Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best. And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone. I regret buying this, hopefully  amazon has an amazing customer support and post sales, and I'm sure I'll be able to get my money back."
R3RDBFHPZJUVM0,2,"I returned my Sennheiser RS120 headphones a few hours after I received them. The noise cancellation feature does not work. Try a simple test. Wait for your refrigerator to start running. Stand next to it. Turn on a set of noise cancelling headphones (like the ones from Sony) and the sound of the refrigerator will drop drastically. Now try that same test with the Sennheiser headphones and notice that there is no noise cancellation.<br /><br />Also, these are big and bulky. It is like they took two computer speakers and put them on a head band. I already have wireless headphones from Radio Shack and that set is light weight with good sound. These Sennheiser's have good sound quality, but weigh about three times as much.<br /><br />I had hoped to get one set of headphones that combined what my other two sets already do. Instead, these Sennheisers do not have noise cancelation and are not very usable as headphones. I returned them.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser  RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
R33QWT88EQ9KXB,3,"I have and like the RS130's and wanted to get a second pair for my wife as a way to get around my (and most? all?) receiver's design of insisting on turning off the speakers when I use the headphones (oh yeah, WHO would ever dream of wanting to leave the speakers on when they use headphones).<br /><br />Apparently Sennheiser in their wisdom was stopped producing the 130's, and the cost, even for used ones, has gone through the roof.  So I decided to get the 120's as I don't really care about the 130's \\""surround sound\\"" mumbo jumbo.  Although the audio of the 120's is fine, little did I realize how different the feel of wearing them is.  Whereas the 130's are cupped and fit nicely around the ears, \\""grabbing\\"" them so I can walk around and do stuff and forget that they are on, the 120's are flat and kinda push against the ears.  Don't lean over the sink with these on!"
R2AJ3W7U1PHNYM,1,I cannot make sense of the directions. they say put the red plug in the area marked r. But not where black plug goes. I have tried<br />every configuration no sound in ears.
R1F6O2U3IHCS35,4,"Got a head set because my wife's hearing is better than mine and doesn't need the TV volume as high as I do.  Works good, hooks up fast."
R25DSHC0Z0QEWR,2,"I have purchased 2 of these & returned both to Amazon.  They both have a problem with static on the headphones side of the equipment.  It will be working fine then if you turn your head wrong, some loud static right to your ears.  Very hard to adjust the volume when the static begins.  I honestly couldn't recommend this item."
R8QHN27T5ZPF9,5,"While I have only been using this headphone for a short period of time, so far it is excellent. If it lasts longer than the piece of crap I got from Sony it will be well worth the investment. Only time will tell but so far I'm impressed."
RNGN5FI0ADI6Y,3,"Easy enough to set up.  I was impressed that it uses RF frequency, so I'm able to walk around the house and even outside and pick up a decent signal from the transmitter.  Comfort and sound are so-so; nothing bad, but nothing great, either.  It keeps the \\""stereo\\"" aspect of the sound, but the sound itself is a little hollow.  Really, for me this is about being able to watch tv in bed without disturbing my wife.  So it works ok from that perspective.  Not sure why, but I get a slight, brief, repeating static sound, about once every second.  Presumably interference from something, but there's only so far from the tv I can have it, since the base needs to plug into that, and there really isn't a lot of extra equipment around it.  However it's not that bad, and for most listening, I can't hear it, only noticeable when the audio from the tv is really quiet (and it's there regardless of the headphones \\""channel\\"" I use).    All that said, this shipped about 2 weeks ago, and last night I turned the tv on and couldn't hear anything.  It's plugged in, and the \\""charge\\"" light comes on with the headphones on the unit, but no green light indicating it's getting the signal from the tv, even with the volume all the way up.  Spoke with tech support, going to try a couple of their suggestions, but if those don't work, it's going to have to go back (Sennheiser has a 2-year warranty, and presumably this would be covered, but they don't pay for shipping).  We'll see.    UPDATE: Their suggestion was to have the tv on, pull the connection to the tv out (which frankly isn't easy to do, they way it's located in the transmitter), keep it unplugged for 10 seconds, then plug it back in.  This did the trick.    FURTHER UPDATE: This happened again, and 10 seconds didn't do it -- had to have it off for extended period of time to re-set.  Also noticed that it works better if the tv's volume is up significantly, though again, repeating interference sound is still there during quiet moments.    Overall, it's solid for wireless use, but not the unit I'd recommend if you're looking for particularly high-quality sound."
R1UK9KVNIZEU96,5,"After having returned a couple of Sony headsets(from a local retailer) due to wireless interference issues, I bought 3 of these Sennheisers. Good decission as the headphones have a wheel to fine tune on the transmission channel. Not a single bit of white noise and can even walk outside the house and have a good reception.<br /><br />This also means that either of the headphones can tune in to one of the 3 available transmission channels. This means I only need one transmitter per room which is great for our set-up with 3 TV areas.<br /><br />The sound is very decent (Don't expect Dr Dre booming sound)and since the transmitter is not hooked up to an AV receiver, it means there is no base/trebble adjustment involved. I suspect that the sound will be great with some form of EQ involved.<br /><br />Another nice touch the charging method. No more wires, plugs or swapping batteries. Just place the headphones back to the cradle and the charging starts. Very elegant solution. Comfortable to wear too.<br /><br />So I have to give this 5 stars for the money. After using the units now for about a month, our family is very happy with them :-)"
R3UIU2YT83OD4N,5,"Great product.  Has clear, no buzz or hum sound, even at low volumes. Very good stereo effects.  Very good value."
R2LFDMON0G9WJS,5,"Easy to set up, easy to use  great sound. I bought my first pair for my  tv in the living room the sound wascrystal clear Iwas so amazed by the quality I bought a second pair my tv upstairs."
RIWQ0WSHQOZHZ,5,"Although a pretty old model, this is a value for money product. Decent comfort on the ear, sound quality is acceptable in my opinion and the range is pretty far (still able to hear the content without any noise when within 2 storeys away)."
RZER2MJ6QK2YQ,5,These are one of the best sets of headphones I have ever had. The reception is excellent; the sound is clear and well defined and the ability to walk all over the house and not miss any dialogue is great. The price at Amazon was really compelling in giving them a try. They do have an annoying hiss if left on when the sound is muted or if using fast or slow motion for a long period. But that is not a very large problem at all.<br />I am very happy with these!
R2SKOYL6E1NRFG,5,"I have been searching for a wireless headphone set since my last one stopped working. I found the set I wanted at a local store then went online here on Amazon and found it for twenty dollars less. It is exactly what I was looking for ,has great sound quality and I couldn't be more pleased. I like to do my house and yard work and be able to listen to my music at the same time. One little kink is that I sometimes have to turn my head to get it to tune in because of studs in the house or maybe its the other electrical products running but it is a minor adjustment compared to the overall quality. I love it. I give it five stars."
RVJ3A3C7XQS9W,5,These headphones are FABULOUS!  The sound quality is better than the Sony headphones I have and the range from the cradle is incredible!
R233SEUBOR1RYD,4,"This over-the-head Wireless Headphone works wonders.  The sound is crystal clear.  I can even hear the TV while I'm downstairs raiding the refrigerator. For the first time in about 10 years, I am really enjoying the music from the TV as well as finally understanding what the actors are saying.  Thanks Sennheiser."
RV1E5O79TRC69,5,These headphones do exactly as described.  Would highly recommend them.  Great value for the price and convenient to use and store.
RO73433K2G98P,5,This is the second set of headphones that I have bought.  One for the family room and this new one for the bedroom.  It greatly enhances the sound of what your watching and the clarity is wonderful!  It's also good because you can even keep your television on mute and the sound still comes thru the headphones.  So if someone is sleeping or you have children studying the television will not disturb them.  I highly recommend this product!
RTOH4N49LMO0S,5,"I'll try to keep this simple and to the point.<br /><br />I was looking to replace an old Audio Logic wireless headset, mostly because there was zero bass response, otherwise they worked fine.<br /><br />So I receive these, connected them to my receiver and started watching some movies (Inception, Dark Knight).<br /><br />Overall sound is very crisp and clear, there is no lisp or hissing on spoken words. Bass is not up to par with other wired headsets, it is light but you can notice it. The bass is pleasant enough. You should note that you cannot adjust bass through headset, so you better make sure you have a receiver that can adjust bass, or some other form to adjust it, otherwise you're stuck with whatever comes through the source.<br /><br />These are very comfortable and fit me snug. I honestly can't say I agree with other users complaining about their headsets falling off, you must have EXTREMELY TINY heads. The headset is adjustable and has comfortable padding. For me personally, the lack of cuffs on the ear pads is good because I have never had any success with ear cuffs NOT making your ears hurt after an extended period of use.<br /><br />A couple of flaws might be intermittent periods of silence and hissing (hissing part is very, very rare as long as you tune to the best reception). What you should always do with any headset is make sure the volume on the source (in my case, receiver) is set all the way up. If you don't do this, your headset is stuck with a very low incoming volume and instead has to compensate for it, resulting in hissing/static.<br /><br />I used these to watch the Breaking Bad Season 5 mid-finale, and I noticed during some conversations where you can only hear crickets in the audio stream, the headset sort of \\""shuts off\\"" in a manner of speaking, you lose audio but immediately gain it back whenever the volume picks up, or someone speaks, you DO NOT lose any audio in the stream, it simply goes silent during very silent periods.<br /><br />People complain about the tuning and volume knob being close together, but it's all about muscle memory with this. It will take you no less than a day, or a couple of uses to know where each knob is. No complaints here.<br /><br />I give this 5 stars for the price, quality and convenience."
RP6RX7A9U7BMP,2,"I was highly anticipating these wireless headphones as the only other pair of wireless headphones I used were 40 bucks and terrible. That was years ago, I was hoping these would be different, but they're not. They have good sound quality but theres a constant buzz/humming noise no matter where I place the base and no matter how I tune the frequency, that is completely unacceptable as I just wanted headphones to have on while in my office so I could just walk around from time to time, lay down on the couch, and still be isolated with my music.I just received the headphones today, tried them out for a couple hours, returning them. I will never try wireless again, the loss in audio quality is just not worth it."
R1NN0PBARTZPHJ,3,"Not Sennheiser's best effort here.  Like many other reviews, my biggest complaint is that these headphones will fall off your head at the blink of an eye.  But I only use them for watching TV in bed.  I am also disappointed in the sound, i.e. - rather muffled, too much bass, voices not as clear as they should be.  I also have the RS130 headphones, and they are MUCH better.  I had the RS140 headphones before I got these two sets, and the sound and fit were fantastic.  However, they malfunctioned after about a year of use.  Sennheiser stood behind them but, unfortunately, they no longer made the RS140.  So they replaced them with the 130.  I would love to have another 140, but they are very rare."
R12IKM2WUCUB24,5,I saw people were complaining about the background / white noise but I found them to be quite noiseless compared to the old Sony ones I had.
R1YR8Y8GQZ4G93,5,I purchased these headset for my mother who has been finding it harder and harder to hear the TV.  It works wonderfully for her. Very little static; generally clear crisp sound. Wonderful product in the price range.
RMHEFNQ1WUZSR,5,Bought this for late night TV viewing. Works well from out on my patio 50' from transmitter.<br />I actually enjoy watching movies from this headset more than my home theater system.<br />My mom will be right next to me reading a book while I'm watching some obnoxious action flick.<br />Easy to use and the battery lasts longer than my 5 hour movie marathons when I chill on sundays.<br />For what I use this for I see no need in going to the next higher model for $50 more.
R2WI68DXC4HL4,2,"I was expecting a functional wireless headphone but apparently a 60 bucks headphone is too cheap to do just that.  This headphone has a LOT of static noise at close range (I've experienced with all different frequency band).  Not only is there static noise, the wavelength disturbance is very obvious as you move away from the transmitter.  I don't think this headphone is worth the money, it's pretty bad.  I am just too lazy to return it..."
R22VRCPHV8K1Q4,5,"I am very pleased with the features of this product.  The batteries that come with the unit charge themselves wirelessly while the headset is on the cradle.  How easy is that!  The last set of wireless headphones I owned had to be placed into a charger just perfectly to make connection, while these are a simple and easy setup without cumbersome connections.  The sound quality is great and the fit is adjustable.  I use them while exercising on a treadmill and an elliptical machine.  Very pleased with the product."
R240U0OX4R7I07,5,"I bought this product about a year ago it works perfectly, I wish all the stuff I have bought from Amazon worked this well."
RHENHABI1N9FC,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 arrived on time and nicely packaged.  I read reviews of other headphones and the associated problems and so was wary.  With this headphone there was zero setup, I took it out of the box, inserted the included rechareable batteries, plugged in the receiver and hung the headset on the receiver to charge.  The next day I plugged the base into a vcr I use as a TV tuner using the included RCA plugs (phono and 3.5mm also included) turned it on and listened to a TV show while using a treadmill.  Absolutely clear sound with no interferring noise.  I have added earmuff like covers to protect the headset from sweat while working out.  The headset is light and comfortable and is recommended for the workout room as well as sitting.  Why would you try to save a few bucks to get an inferior product and I see no reason to spend more.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser  RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
R3K6BIXP2NAESQ,5,Bought these for my father in law who doesn't hear very well.  He has been using them for months now and he reports that they work great.  Sound quality and comfort are excellent.
R1OVGM2UNXFYB9,4,I bought these so that I wouldn't bother my wife while working out and they work great. I have been using them almost every day for a month on the same initial cahrge. The only reason for 4 stars is that they don't fit very snugly and tend slip (only a little) while I am on my treadmill.
R2K2C8CABCHCF9,4,"bought these for my wife, so she could listen to TV while I snored.  benefit for me is I can fall asleep and not be kept up by TV noise.  now if she could just dim the TV.  Wife's only complaint is that the headphones don't block out outside noise completely, but she's happy with them."
R2Y0F3IVIQBCBJ,4,"Top-notch product, like Sennheiser products usually are. Extremely sensitive to other nearby electronic objects and wireless devices(when they are operating. Examples: TV, Xbox, DVD Player, laptop with wireless Internet). The sound quality makes up for it though, and plus you can't expect perfection with wireless headphones. If you do not like sitting close to your TV and need a pair of affordable headphones, I would recommend these. Of course these are some of the lower priced headphones from Sennheiser. If you've got the extra money I'd suggest you increase your price range beyond these."
R1PMHKUFKM0782,5,This is an excellent Product. I am very happy with it. I can watch TV while my wife can sleep. Quality of sound is superb. I will recommend this to anyone.
RRFOTIH9PM3OZ,2,"We were happy with our purchase but after a few weeks using, the headphones were dropped on the ground from 1' height. And since then it's dead, we open it to check what's wrong but we were not able to fix it. Now it's standing next to our tv and waiting to be thrown away. What a waste of money!"
R2SRELG6IDNN1U,5,"Read reviews on all lower price units and problems with reception and static.  Read reviews on Amazon and other places about the Sennheiser.  The headphones work not only in the living room but i get perfect reception in all rooms on first floor of my  house.  I was not expecting that.  Only problem I had was plugging into the audio jack on my TV.  I plugged into wrong one initially.  (There are two separate and distinct jacks on my TV for audio output.)  In a review that I had read, the person said connect direct to TV so you can take advantage of playing dvd's, or instant from Netflix or Amazon, good advice.<br /><br /> The unit works flawlessly and I have recommended these to my other hard of hearing friends."
RTYQ10RPNGNYP,1,"The headphones only lasted 3-4 weeks, I need a new set of wireles sennheiser headphones. Please send it to the same adress using the same AMEX card.  You don't need to send the charger.  Mike"
R2YOK3SXYSNG3G,5,"I purchased these headphones because my husband is an early riser and likes the volume up loud on the tv. We have a home theatre setup with a subwoofer, sound bar and blu-ray player. All the audio outs were either taken or were not the right connections so wouldn't work with the transmitter. We have a Directv HR24 receiver so I plugged the transmitter into that. It had the correct connections so no need to buy any other cables or converters etc. The headphones worked immediately and the sound quality is quite good. Another person in the room can also listen to the tv if desired by using the regular audio system, or leave the audio system turned off and have the sound on the headphones only, which is perfect for early morning or late night tv watching in a small house such as ours. It's easy to tell when they are charging correctly since there's a light to indicate it. Very pleased with this purchase!"
R3GXYTGPZHVSRT,5,"The Seinnhauser headphones and charger have been a lifesaver.  Both my lady (who is even harder of hearing than me) and I can use them comfortably and hear with ease without having the TV blasting away.Charger works well, we alternate nights of charge.  We like them!"
RV6GIZJEKZCWB,4,"Overall I like these headphones.<br /><br />Good:<br />Sound quality - good base and overall sound quality<br />Range - 100ft in back or front yard with no sound degradation<br />Price - Good deal on Amazon at $63 (Retail stores all around $99)<br />Ease of use/connectivity - Attach the AC unit to the wall and the base station, audio wires to device, done.<br />Automatic recharge when placed on base.<br /><br />Not as good:<br />Ear pads/fit - flat pads make the headphones highly mobile on your head. Not great for lying in bed as pillow contact pushes them off ears.<br />Balance - The unit I bought is a little louder on the left side. Changed sources etc but same. (Yes, I switched L/R on my head to test my ears).<br /><br />Overall I give them a 4, but the balance is a little irritating. At low volumes at night watching TV, the difference is quite noticeable. As the volume increases the difference fades (noticing it fades). Being a nerdy type I opened the headphones to try and find a balance or gain pot but no luck. It's not quite irritating enough to return them, but I wish they were balanced better. I've had them only two days so I might become more frustrated by the end of the week and return them for the same type hoping for better luck with the balance issue."
RAINCSC2O5Y5I,5,"Well, first I'd like to say I waited over a year of using these headphones to finally write this review.  I work overnight 12 hour shifts, so I have many nights off at home where I stay awake while the rest of my family (wife, very young daughter) are sleeping.  I also really love watching movies.<br /><br />When I came across these headphones I really wanted a wireless headphone that wasn't super expensive.  I used to use an extension cable hooked into my headphone jack, stringing wires all over my living room and causing me to have to remove the headphones any time I got up (bathroom break, grabbing snacks).  I'd like to say the wireless range on these are pretty good and very convenient.  I've even taken out the trash while wearing these headphones, hearing perfectly the whole time.<br /><br />As far as sound quality goes, I hear absolutely no difference as wearing regular headphones.  If for some reason these ever fail, I WILL try out the next class up, but these are good enough I see no reason to upgrade.  The battery life is also really good.  I don't remember one time where the battery has died while using them (with the originally rechargeable batteries they came with!).<br /><br />In fact the only downfall I can think of is laying down with the headphones on is not very comfortable.  But isn't that what is expected with over the ear headphones.<br /><br />Overall I say this is a great buy.  When I purchased these I could not find any store that had them as cheap as Amazon did.  As I said before, I WILL buy these again (if I ever need to of course)."
R3A4B893R2VFNI,4,"A friend recommended these and I was of the understanding that you could turn the tv volumn down to 0 and still listen comfortably loud on the headphones.  Well, that is not what I got, we have to leave the volumn up a little on the tv set to still be able to get a good loud volumn on the headphones.  We can still use these headphones in our situation but I thought they would be better than they are."
R2SMQERUXJ8DM2,4,We were excited after reading the reviews and hoping this product would be what we were looking for.  We were not dissapointed.  The quality is very nice and the performance has been better than expected.  We can now listen to TV without any noise while our 6 month old sleeps 1 room over.  The product provides very submersive sound which helps us enjoy programs even more.
RQ9MKAO6SEHDF,5,"After reading the many good reviews, I bought two of these headsets for me and my wife... Primarily I bought one for me as I am hard of hearing and had to have the captions on the TV to make sure that I understood everything being said. We recently moved into a new house that has a large open great room with high ceilings and hardwood floors, making the acoustics in the room that much more difficult for me to hear the TV... after hooking up the first headset I was amazed on how clear the sound was. I could hear things in the background that I don't recall hearing in many years. Immediately I knew that I would be keeping this product and opened the other set that my wife wanted... One of the great things is you only have to hook up one base and you can use both headsets... you just have to either swap out charging times or hook up the other charging base if you want... Goodbye captions... I would highly recommend this product."
R3DLMXP3J38TEL,4,"This headset system does what it is intended to do, improve listening to the TV. Biggest problem is that if you move around at all the headset does not stay put, but tends to fall off. Also it is hard to find the volume control<br />without taking the headset off."
RD1AUHBYMBU94,5,These headphones are excellent for my needs.  They were easy to connect to my (ancient) television and came with a mini-jack adapter for newer televisions.  They come with rechargeable batteries that charge simply by placing the headphones on the base station.  I haven't had any trouble with interference and the sound comes through nice and clear.
R3A1YRPEWWX01C,2,The wireless headphones did a good job of amplifying sound from the TV.  I found that the earphones were uncomfortably warm when worn for a half hour or more.
R2CE77ZG77F44T,4,"I'll make this review quick and easy.  I've been wanting a wireless headphone for a long time. It's definitely line of sight.  But that's ok with me.  I watch TV in bed and the tv is on the other side of the room.  The reception is clear.  The headphone isn't too bulky.  It's rechargeable.  I think I've used it 2 or 3 nights in a row (1 hour each night) and it's kept it's charge.  There are only 2 things that I would say negative about the product.<br />1) the headphone doesn't quite fit on the charger perfectly.  You have to set it just right in order for it to recharge.  I just put a weight (I use our remote) on it and it gives it enough pressure so it's pressing down on the charger<br />2) if you have the tv on pause (dvr) for 30 seconds and come back, the wireless headphones drops it's signal.  I have to rewind the dvr for about a minute and let it play for a while before the green signal light comes.  The green signal indicates that it's transmitting the audio.  When it goes out, the headphone doesn't work.  It doesn't happen often but the 1-2 minute wait is a little annoying."
RO7BGU0GCQZGE,2,"I have had these about 2 hours.  Easy to set up.  The sound is good.<br /><br />They are not comfortable.  They fit is exceptionally loose with no grip for your head.  Turning your head means you will be wearing them on your face and not your ears.<br /><br />The \\""tune\\"" is right next to the volume so I have screwed it up quite a few times.  Just adjusting the headphones.  The volume doesn't go that loud.<br /><br />Don't buy these they suck."
R625YJ69T7L3M,3,"I bought this with the intention of using them with my PC.  The big annoyance is the automatic gain control which i didn't even read about in the description.  So if i turn my pc volume down  the head set  turns the volume up which also increases the static. And this runaway automatic adjustment can wreck songs with a good bit  of quiet in them and therefore mess with movie soundtracks. And also pc related when there is no sound input for a few minutes the sudden loud static will scare the socks off you. The quality effective range in my house is  50 feet. It might  work to 256 feet in a open field but certainly not a  house. It  does have  good clarity and good bass for a head set.  The  tuning button surprised,i assumed this was automatic.  But  i was able to tune it without to much hassle.  The best bit  is that it is  wireless without to much sacrifice .  Once you destroy a  few wired head sets on your chair or table you will appreciate these. and a addon on note...Super Comfortable!! I didn't even realize how comfortable they were till i tried a friend's  high end gaming headset."
R3GIPSUGDIQGRE,5,"The RS120 is a high quality, easy to use headphone.  The unit is attached to our DISH receiver, which allows two different sound levels, one for the person with the headphone and one for the person with the TV remote. There is no unwanted noise and the batteries are always charged.  The hook-up is very easy.<br /><br />The unit was purchased from Amazon at a fair price."
R7EKSQQK87PPT,2,"These sound good considering the frighteningly loose fit. Great if you intend never to move once you put them on. Kinda defeats bragging about range if you can't walk around.  They constantly shift, even when the wearer sits in one place, making them annoyingly uncomfortable despite the light weight.  These headsets are very large in both width and band height. Extremely poor design.<br /><br />Decent quality sound for a mild or even moderate high end hearing loss if they fit. The lack of bass will probably help with clarity if using for TV viewing. If you have a reverse slope loss these will sound pretty bad. And of course, the looser the fit, the worse the sound quality.<br /><br />They charge easily and the buttons, while idiotic in placement, are pretty easy to get used to.<br /><br />Sennheiser has made too many unnecessary sacrifices in making these lower cost wireless headphones. Having tried on a number of the different wired Sennheiser headphones from the cheapest to some of the most expensive, I was shocked at how ill fitting these are. It seemed effort was put into making these truly substandard. Poor design ensures a listening experience that is inferior to the tech utilized in the headphones, widening the quality gap between these and their next tier of wireless headphones."
R10X3SDDK33C02,4,Recveed gift of Koss it died in 2 days retuened it and bought the RS 120 based on Amazon reviews.  I use it at night and my wife in the am. We have had the headphones for 3 months - and recommend it to all.
RMQB0XLDMYPKV,5,"Service was great, received it in 2 days.  Very easy to connect, and works perfectly right out of the box.  I use it for watching TV so I won't bother other family members.  I've had 2 sets of TV Ears which were purchased at COSTCO, but the price went up about $100.  The TV Ears are rather cheaply made, and both transmitters have failed.  So far this Sennheiser set great.  Sounds a lot better than the TV Ears, and much more comfortable."
R1Y6OXQ8NJ1XFD,3,"This product does what it's supposed to do. For the price, it gets the job done; I do not have to deal with long cables to listen to my movies without bothering those around me, or my neighbors. Is there a better product out there for the price? Probably. Am I satisfied with this one? Yes, it is okay."
R2FUOSOBINC3R2,5,"The  headphones are just plain excellent. I have nothing to add to other reviews.<br />I am writing this hoping to help someone that has a tv like mine that has only a single audio output (no headphone jack either).<br />Because I am a night owl I need headphones so I had to buy a  DAC digital to analog converter to get the headphones to work (just search Amazon for this item).<br />My headphones come with two RCA plugs., A black and a red for left and right stereo sound. Nothing new about that.<br />What is different is that one will need a digital audio cable with two male plugs (yes, Amazon has them, too).<br />One end will plug into the digital out on the tv and the other to the digital connector on the converter.<br />Then it is just a matter of plugging the heaphones into the converter and following the advise of all the other folks in the myriad of reviews to set it up. It has a decent little setup manual also.<br />I had been using the DAC converter for about a year using the mini jack for wired headphones and it has become unreliable. I would advise using the RCA plugs for a snugger and more reliable fit.<br />Hope this was helpful to somebody and good luck to you all. - giggy"
R2IX86XNRV8RNV,1,The headset is soo Noisy it's not worth it and the raing is about 5 meters more than that you will hear nothing but the silly channel noise
R23JDMKCPDVUXC,4,"I like the great sound and the long range of this product.However when I'm walking around doing other things while listening and I happen to bend over to do something,The earphones slide off. Otherwise I,m very happy with them."
R3E05AXHFD7062,4,The sound and reception are very good.  Much better than the old pair that they replaced which could create static from just moving my head.  The one complaint is that they will slip off ones head very easily.  They would not be a good choice if one plans to use them while working around the house.
R16F1CZ53ONBNC,5,These headphones are terrific. They helped save my marriage.  I have a hearing problem and have them hooked up to my television so that the TV is not blasting.  I am one of those individuals that hear you talkings but can not make our what you are saying.  The headphones help eleviate that issue. Trying to buy another set at this price.
R27TXJKDKQGT5Q,5,"I thought nothing would equal the now discontinued Acoustic Research AW721 900 MHz Wireless Stereo Headphones, these do and are possibly better. I own a lawn service and listen to music all day via wireless head phones with a mp3 player connected to the wireless transmitter. The transmitter is in the cab of my truck. I frequently am out of sight of the vehicle in back yards etc. So dropouts and fading signals are unacceptable to me. These work better then the AR's with no fading or hiss. I hope they will hold up as good as the AR's did. I am very happy that the ear foam covers can be ordered unlike the AR's and have ordered 2 pairs as a precaution."
R2OB9UETRHYWKT,4,These headphones are all they say they are. Great sound and no static due to the awesome easy tuning. I use them while I'm on the treadmill and they tend to slip a bit. The range is exceptionally good and they receive well through walls.I wore them outside to the mailbox which is over 100 feet from the house and they still had great sound. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the tuning and volume dials are so close together. I guess it's just a matter of getting use to. Other than that it is well worth the  purchase.
RUFSPHGB7Y8N8,4,"After the sixth pair of headphones died from a broken cord I figured I would go with a wireless solution. So far, these have been wonderful (about a month) great battery life and good quality sound.<br />Pros: I can walk away from my PC and do stuff while listening to a podcast.<br />  No Cord to break or bind.<br />  Decently priced for quality delivered.<br />Cons: Easily slip off if bending over just slightly (and I have a giant head)<br />  Sound is better, with less interference, 20 feet away as opposed to 1-3 feet away.<br />  Volume and Tuning are right in line with each other and easily hit (Tuning should be on the side with the power switch IMO)<br />TICU (Things I can't understand): WHY when there is no sound for X minutes does the base turn off? This is aggravating and completely backwards to what it should  do.  The effect of having a video or sound clip end, and as you sit there listening to nothing SUDDEN STATIC BLASTING YOUR EARS. As far as I can tell this would actually decrease the battery life of the headphones as static uses more power than silence. The headphones should have a timer NOT the base."
R10SANYRTPYUGI,4,"The major imperfection I've discovered is they don't stay securely in place when I bend over or move quickly.  So wearing these during yoga or other vigorous activity may not work. The sound is very good and I do not experience the hiss some have mentioned, at least within my 900 sq ft. condo. It all hooks up easily (in my case to my stereo receiver).  I have noticed some interference (again it's a condo), but the ability to change channels and fine tune makes it pretty easy to solve. I think the range gets overstated. I was able to get a (fading) signal about 100 feet down a corridor (while doing laundry) but lost the signal in the thick walls of the laundry room. No biggie. In terms of comfort, I find my ears and neck start to feel a little strain after a couple of hours.  That's to be expected."
R1R4S6Z2YLVR4Z,3,"Good wireless headphones with great sound. The replaceable ear pads can be both good and bad. Since they are flat they do not surround the ear and therefore tend to slip off your head with any movement. O K if you are just sitting, but not good if moving around and doing any bending over or tipping of the head. For this reason I will be returning."
R1NATR8DT9NEPH,2,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser  RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]I recently purchased this item to shield my wife from my computer noise.  The first few days they worked fine except the would occasionally pop, which was disconcerting.  After the first week they began to pop and hiss and I could not tune out the interference.  Another day passed and all I could get was the hissing noise, no audio.  Either I got a bad set of them or there is a circuit defect.  I bought them based on the reviews of customers who had bought them from the Amazon site.  I hope the reviewers are careful in their reviews, people really do read them carefully and spend their hard to come by money based on what they read."
R2BB6OX1BUYA2H,5,"I got these for my girlfriend to use when she exercises so that she can watch TV while she's on the treadmill or bike. We've had them about 6 months and they've worked flawlessly. The range is great - we can go upstairs and listen to our music or TV the entire time, or even out in the back yard. Hook-up was easy and this is one of the top brand names. I've used them a lot also for watching late night TV while everyone else is asleep and they haven't disappointed me at all. They're comfortable and easy to use. I've had experiences with both Sony and AR sets before and these are better. One thing - when you put the phones back in the cradle, make sure they're facing the right way around or they won't charge. There's a light to show if they're charging."
RT0HVFP9WTY93,4,I find these headphones to be adequate & good fitting for an active person (I do yoga with them on).
R2BAT63X9SXCMZ,2,"While the headphones themselves are really nice compared to nothing, I would really not advise anyone to get them at this price.<br /><br />If they don't have an audio feed, say if you have a game or movie paused, for more than five minutes they start with a loud hiss and pop that may have already damaged the drivers themselves.<br /><br />Pretty uncomfortable for a wireless set, the foam and design of the earpads are like a form of torture after an hour.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I got a wired gaming headset recently for a bit more in price and the difference and experience is drastically better.<br /><br />My opinion, DON'T BUY. Get a cheaper set of wireless headphones that have the same quality, or just pay a bit more for something a lot better. That is up to you to decide."
R2S1B42143WNXT,2,"Charged unit and it only lasted for 20 minutes before the batteries went dead. We then replaced the batteries that came with the unit with different ones and charged the unit again. It worked fine, but we are disappointed that the company would ship units with such lousy and possibly defective batteries that did not seem to hold their charge. The headset is OK, but if you buy, there is a chance you will have to spring to fix the manufacturer's apparent battery problem."
R2GW6MJ5CFPNVP,4,I like these headphones a lot. They sound great for the price. The only thing I dislike is that they do have a hissing sound every so often. But you really do get to hear a lot of things in movies that you don't get to hear through your tv speakers.
R3TVILU224VPFD,5,"Very comfortable, better than the ear bud style. I can walk all over the house without losing reception.  I really like these so far."
RXN3XQOT3EBZA,1,They constantly fall off of my head! I tried them on other people with the same result.<br />When I manage to keep them on my head (sit still and keep head perfectly level) they perform reasonably well.....<br />Uncomfortable after 20-30 minutes as they are bulky and quite heavy.
R2IQ0OA7G5AN3I,2,Bought these to watch TV in the evenings without disturbing the kids. They have a fairly constant background hiss that I could probably learn to live with. It's the intermittent higher pitched interference/static/feedback that really got to me in the end. Tried all the suggestions like switching the transmitter channel/tuning or increasing the source sound on the TV but it made no difference. I'd be watching a scene and the interference would just randomly kick in and it was deafening at times -- literally would have to pull them off my head as quick as possible and then try again when my ears had recovered. Returned them after a week. Bought some conventional wired over the ear JVC headphones and an extension cable. For my purposes they are much better and actually about $50 cheaper.
R18JL65NSCU8RQ,5,Reasonable price - nice quality. Can't beat that. I didn't want to spend 300 bux for a set of Bose. These definitely do the job.
R1V3V45LNAUGT9,4,"After buying and using seveeral different and more expensive headphones, I have found these wireles headphones perform as advertised and seems to be worth<br />a a lot more than expected. Thanks for offering aquality produvt at a reasonable price."
R186LAG9TY7LRA,5,"My parents have these headphones, because they are hard of hearing, so I knew they would be good.  The sound quality is excellent and I especially appreciate the fact that I can listen to the television while the sound is turned off."
RVPQRPTBOY5XZ,1,Very limited range for outdoor usage. Reception tuning is so crude. Wears uncomfortable. Definitely a RETURN. The 4/5-star reviews led to disappointment!
R2JVS8MEJLGZMI,5,"My husband has been declared almost totally deaf, he wears hearing aids which help but, hearing anything w/o them is awful because he hears all the other noises and it interferes with the sound quality and that includes being in a room with a lot of people, restaurants etc.  These head phones are fantastic, he hears all of the program, movie, music and I am glad that they make his life a little easier with great quality of sound as with these.  I would recommend these to ANYONE!"
R36FKGZ0TRT9DD,2,"yes, they just quit working after 3 months. You put them on, they work for about 10 minutes and then they go off. They are fully charged. This is the 3rd different brand we've tried, can't seem to find one that lasts...."
R3JOCPKLA6DXB7,2,"I am disappointed with Sennheiser regarding the RS120.  Constant hiss and loss of signal when moving.  I had a Radio Shack 90 MHz earphones, much cheaper that have better sound quality and very reliable.  Unfortunately, they no longer sell this, as I have worn out the charging system and the unit needs help.  I will return the Sennheiser RS120 and hope to find one more reliable and hiss free."
R2SMI9Z54MP7J4,3,"OK, I attached some Vetwrap to each earphone and when on the Vetwrap goes on the back of my head and everything is fine.  I guess this is why so many of these are earbuds, which I hate, or have the back of head configuration, which I also hate.  So this is a tolerable compromise.<br /><br />-------Earlier in the day ---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I thought these would be fabulous and they sound great.  But they fall off my head unless my head is perfectly straight.  No way to adjust them tighter.  I can't walk around the house unless I am holding them on my head with one hand.  Had I bought them in a store I would have known they wouldn't work for me.  Now I am trying to figure out something like an elastic headband or maybe attaching them to a baseball cap or something.  My wired Bose headphones are fine.  I can reach down and tilt my head totally upside down and they will stay on.  This is a shame.  And I am very frustrated.  Second pair of headphones I have hated once I got them."
R19E2OXPAQ7IYH,5,"I have a hearing problem and had bought a different product prior to purchasing these.  Paid more for the other<br />product and was never happy with the \\""ear plug\\"" type headset (TV ears).  I bought my first set of these headphones some<br />months ago.  They are very comfortable, although, become a little sloppy after wearing them awhile.  I suspect<br />that they purposely are built that way to keep from having that crushing feeling after using for awhile.<br />I had a problem in connecting the headphones and contacted Sennheiser.  Their support was great and the problem<br />was solved in short order. My Daughter was here a few days ago and tried them on and she was so taken by them<br />that I bought her a set.  She received them and hooked them up and working in a few hours. Sound is great,<br />better than the listener's listening on the TV. I would rate the frequency range as great, but again, I have<br />a hearing problem, so what do I know. I know I get the true stereo sounds, which took some getting used, for me.<br />And the sound is very rich."
R12I752R55KTWR,5,"These headphones are amazing, They sound so good and are very comfortable, just exactly what i wanted. Got them just today wasn,t really expecting them until the end of the week. Easy setup, just plug and play. I purchased these from dahmart and they are recoditioned but except for that fact that they were not in the original box they look like they are brand new. What can I say good price, great product, fast shipping. Thank You."
R3Q0LV2YMDM9NW,2,Initially thought headphones were working well.however by 2nd use unable to hear anything through headphones except static.will be contacting company to give them a chance  to offer solution to this problem.will have to wait and see...
R2S4CD2KXMUOCW,5,"It seems most of the negative reviews for this product have to do with the sound quality, mainly the presence or absence of a hiss. So I guess in that regard its a hit or miss, nothing in between. For us, fortunately the headphones work great with no hiss. Not sure if obstructions or walls cause the hiss other folks have mentioned. We use the headphones approximately 15-20 ft away from the base, and there is no hiss. There is a tuning switch at the back of the headsets which allowed us to tune it to the perfect sound quality. Sort of like tuning a radio.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with the quality of these headsets. Quick rundown of pros and what I would like to see added to the features:<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />- Great price. For $70-80 a piece, these are pretty good headphones given that you get the headphones, a charging base, rechargeable batteries, power cable, and an AV cable with 2 headphone jack adapters.<br /><br />- The headphones are easy to set up, it took me less than 5 minutes to connect them and begin using them. Fairly straight forward set up process - connect power cord, insert battery (battery goes into the headphones), charge headphones, connect AV cable to sound source, and that's really it.<br /><br />- Easy to use - I use this at night to keep sound in the room to a minimum. So I turn the TV volume down to zero and  power up these headphones. On-off, volume, and tuning buttons are on the back of the headphones. Takes a day or two to get used to the controls and it's intuitive after that.<br /><br />- Comfortable to wear - the headphones have ample cushioning on the top and the ear pieces to be comfortable to wear for extended period of time. Nice fit overall.<br /><br />- Charge time seems to be good so far. After leaving it to charge overnight, I have used this for over a week and haven't had the need to charge yet. I would assume 7-10 hours of use during this period. Pretty good, don't need more than that.<br /><br />- Sound quality - The sound quality is pretty good. Once they were tuned to the correct \\""frequency\\"", sound is crisp. No hiss or static. Now these are no Bose NC headsets, so at high volumes, sound from the headphones can be heard by others. But I personally don't listen at high volumes, so it's fine for me. If you want to listen at high volumes, there is a decent amount of \\""drift\\"" outside.<br /><br />Now to the nitpicks - these are features I can live without but it would have been nice to see these features incorporated in future designs:<br /><br />- Sound quality - as I mentioned earlier, high volumes are not that great on this set. It would be nice to get a leather-like trim or maybe a slightly better quality cushion that prevents any sound drift. I have the Bose NC headsets as well that I use on flights and those are impeccable in this regard.<br /><br />- Wireless AV dongle - not sure if something like this even exists, but here's my issue (albeit a very minor one). The stand currently needs to be kept near the TV (or other sound source) because it connects through an AV cable. This means that when I need to charge the headphones, I need to keep them on the stand by the TV. It would be nice if the stand could connect wirelessly so some type of dongle connected to the AV out of the TV. This would allow me keep the headphones by the bedside at all times instead of having to remember to keep them on the stand by the TV every now and then to charge. As I said, minor issue but it's a \\""nice-to-have\\"" feature.<br /><br />Overall these are great headphones and serve the purpose of wireless sound source very well. I personally recommend these very highly based on our experience so far.lity - The sound quality is pretty good. Once they were tuned to the correct \\""frequency\\"", sound is crisp.

R3B1VZMJNGCDC2,5,"After A lot of research and reading reviews I decided on these Sennheiser head phone.I wish i'd bought them years ago.I have trouble hearing TV . I would have to turn the set up so loud,it would bother my wife.I even bought the little hearing aids so I could understand the words in movies(which did'nt work).Now I hear every word. These Sennheiser head phones allows me to listen at my sound range and my wife to listen at her sound range without interfearing with each other. They are easy to hook up.The sound quality is superb.Very comfortable for long periods. The construction is very good.The best thing is that I can hear through the head phones my wife can listen over the tv speakers at the same time. These Sennheiser's are the Cadillac of head phones."
RTOQ9R6QWVQGN,5,"First I replaced my \\""TV-Ears\\"" with these and I could hear the dialog so clearly, I replaced my Father-in-Laws \\""TV-Ears\\"" as well.  He says the difference is day and night.  I just bought a third pair for my own Dad and I'm expecting the same result.  I particularly like the fact that they are RF not infrared, so that I can hop up for a quick snack from the kitchen and I don't miss a thing.  This headset seems to subtly mute the music and background noise while enhancing the voices.  It's make TV worth watching again."
RYLPC8GX2VTMT,2,"It's really hard to adjust the transmitter and channel to optimize sound quality. The louder the volume, the worse the sound quality and the more static noise. I really don't know why Sennheiser make this bad product with high price."
RB7EQQFZR9Z40,5,"Purchased these headphones so my grandfather could watch TV and movies in the living room on high volumes without disturbing the rest of the house. They work great -- awesome sound, great range, and the rechargeable base is a great design. Highly recommended!"
R9JXST45NV34B,5,"Great product. I´ve been using those Headphones for a while, with no problem at all. Strongly recommend this item."
R34MZBBSTEZ98O,4,"I just purchased the RS 120 but I can't get it to work with my TV. I have tried it with the HDMI audio, the other component red/yellow audio jacks, and every other input I can find on my Panasonic television.<br /><br />Don't know if it is my TV or the product.<br /><br />Update: with some quick and responsive email help from Sennheiser, I was able to get the headphones working by going through the DVR receiver. Seem to be working great."
R10FYYG9UNWTDA,1,"Besides having a very limited operating range -- perhaps 30 feet or so before either the left or right channel starts cutting out -- and, when at a distance from the transmitter, being sensitive to the spatial orientation of the headphones to the base unit, the *loud and jolting shock of white noise* produced about minute or so after the Sennheiser RS120's transmitter loses its audio feed motivates me to curse the designers who created this thing and the company that markets it. I've had the RS120 for more than a year and after my initial disappointment, figured I'd find a setting or tuning that would eliminate or at least reduce this problem or that I'd get in the habit of switching the headset off when the podcast I'm listening to ends. But no! Every day at least once I'm assaulted with the inconsiderate jarring design of this product. I recommend looking elsewhere for wireless headphones."
R3V48GGDFLGDR2,5,"I've gone through a lot of different headphones for TV viewing, and these are the best yet!  They are comfortable to wear, deliver excellent sound even at a long distance from the TV, and the batteries stay charged for a long time.  I haven't used the charging cradle, I use a regular battery charger so I always have a spare set of batteries already charged."
R3JO8JKL1US7B5,5,"Fewer batteries to purchase as these are rechargeable by placing headset on special stand<br />each night. The next day the headset batteries are recharged.  Also I can walk outside to do<br />yard work, etc. and still have very good reception."
R2QJP7T1UKWB80,5,"I truely love these headphones.  They were easy to install and even easier to use.  I can go from room to room and still receive a clear sound, so I don't miss a thing.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone...."
R1VH9FXZYHXGOP,5,"Great product, already have two sets and bought a third set for another room. Easy to set up and have never had any problems with performance."
R2P2HC51QB3DM9,5,"I bought these headphones for my husband, who is hard of hearing, so that I could turn down the TV volume so it wasn't hurting my ears, and he could hear clearly. They work perfectly. He is amazed at the clarity--he can now hear things he was missing before. When we first hooked them up, and I tried them, I could hear hissing. But I just adjusted the tuner and it went away. If you read the directions, it says if interference continues after adjusting the tuner, to change the channel using the small buttoon on the bottom of the receiver unit. And if that does not work, move the receiver further away from the interfering unit. I did not have to do all that--as I said, just tuning it fixed the problem. Love them."
R2MPVU5O4385YV,5,this is a great buy easy hook up the sound is great pluse no out side noise i can walk around the house to the kitchen for a snack and dont miss a word
R15VJTWCN5S3SE,5,"Sennheiser RS 120 is a super solution to the household that has a member with difficulty hearing the TV.  The ear phones provide clear sound, are light weight, wireless, and cut out all other sounds.  My husband even admits the stereo is better than our surround sound!  And, he does not miss anything of his program when he has to leave the room for a short while...the sound keeps right on as he walks around the house, etc.  Great product!  Thank you!"
R25KRGYQVSB24X,2,"I like these headphones a lot, but they have a major bug.  Range is great, they are very comfortable, sound quality is awesome, and you can fine tune the signal and volume on the headphones.  If the signal strength gets too low, the headphones disconnect from the transmitter and broadcasts a ear-popping array of screetches, pops, and buzzes.  This has nothing to do with distance from the transmitter, but rather the volume of the original source.  I find that I have to turn up my TV or computer to a louder than normal level and turn down the volume on the headphones to avoid these nasty noises.<br />For the price of the product, this issue is really not acceptable.  I'm disappointed with Sennheiser for releasing a product with such a major flaw."
RGOTPFFLDH84L,5,I bought this as a neccesity for my dad in a nursing home setting. They are easy for him to use and drop back on the charge/ transitter base easily. There was an issue with the tuning dial being adjacent to the volume but a little black tape fixed that. He loves the sound quality and capabilty of the volume being down on his telvision speakers while enjoying his viewing without disturbing his neighbors. Now I wish some of his more hearing impaired neighbors had them!
R1GZBTWFEWZ7BK,5,"These headphones are great, don't know what I would do with out them!  Plus it makes it so much easier to listen to TV when everyone else is sleeping."
R38FTJYSZL4LYF,5,"We have had these headphones for 6 months for my husband. He once again likes to listen to music and loves the fact that he can hear every word spoken in a TV show or movie. It is a wonderful thing for me, who can hear very well, to not have the TV volume cranked all the way up. With these headphones, I can have the volume set low and he can crank up the headphones so he can hear. Last month my 90 year old mother-in-law came for a visit. She is very very hard of hearing even with her hearing aids in. She tried the headphones and was amazed at what she could now hear. She has had her TV volume set as high as it could go and still couldn't hear what was said. We have now gotten her a pair of these headphones and she can now comfortably listen to any show and hear what they are saying. It has changed her life significantly.<br />Make sure to tune them to your reception to eliminate any background noise and then you are good to go."
R3QCVBO41QQLAR,5,"I was skeptical when I first ordered them, but no more, they are clear, clear, clear.  Easy to use, everything the manufacturer said about them.  Thanks, they meet my need."
R2TYVQ9B4V7ANT,5,This is my second set of Sennheiser Headphones and I love them both.  My first set does not have the built in charging cradle and I find the build in charging cradle to be a significant improvement over using rechargable batteries with a third party wall plug in charger.  The sound quality is excellent and the range is superb. I can actually walk around most of my house while listening to a movie or Pandora Radio through my internet connected TV.  The overall construction quality of the product is excellent with no operational issues.  The headphone are a bit large but they are comfortable and very easy to install and use.  Overall a very impressive product.
R14FMY6EMZIOCG,2,"Headphones have a pretty bad receiption, I am about 10 feet from my TV and they still hiss. Also, the headphones constantly get disconnected; for some reason they don't recognize that the sound is coming off the TV. I own a different set of Sennheisers that I had for about 5 years (they cost about $200), which work fine. Skip the cheap version, go for the higher quality model."
R1EOSVEW26V8LN,4,Seinheiser RS120 Over Ear 900MHZ Wireless head phones are well worth the money. The charging cradle is an excellent idea and a must when ordering. Wonderful clarity. Outside sounds are minimalized allowing you to concentrate on the program. A great aid for those who are hearing impaired.
R1MUZ3NREZ4XVE,5,Got these headphones for my mother who has very poor hearing and is in a nursing home.  We are able to mute her TV so she doesn't disturb her neighbors and she can hear the programs quite well.  She remarked about how comfortable these are and they have solved the problem of her running the TV volume loud enough to shake the walls.
RBMM2MXDLJULP,5,"Very happy with my purchase of the Headphone, I only wish they were my more adjustable when lean forward they slip.  But do recommend this and got them in two days"
RCJ66S0QG4YN5,1,"I ordered these headphones from Amazon.  Quick delivery. I have to say I was shocked when I unpacked them. Absolutely cheap plastic junk. I thought because they were of German design the device would be of quality materials. Wrong. I plugged in the 9VDC power supply (very cheap looking) and observed a green led power light.  When I unplugged and plugged the connector back into the unit, no power light. Tried several times. I boxed them up and sent them back the same day. I must say Amazon really takes care of the return shipping in a very hassle-free way. I would order from Amazon again with no reservations."
R3B765MU7B13SH,5,"I put these headphones on my Amazon wishlist because my husband goes to bed early/wakes early and I go to bed later/wake later. I like to watch the late news but I couldn't watch it in bed because it would keep him awake so he bought me these headphones about 9-12 months ago and they work great and are easy to use.  Just push the switch to \\""on\\"" and adjust the volume dial and you're done.  When you're finished, just turn them off and put them back on the recharging cradle.  The sound is clear and tone is great. I can hear very well with the volume on the low end so if you have trouble hearing you can increase the volume quite a bit.<br /><br />I don't know if it was complicated for my husband to set up for me but I don't remember him commenting on it so it must have been pretty easy (he is mechanically and electronically inclined though, if that makes a difference).<br /><br />This item is highly recommended by me and I thought the quality and price were great compared to some others that were quite higher priced."
RME6NH3BB43T2,1,"Whatever good qualities this product has are absolutely erased by the fact that these headphones will turn themselves off automatically when the music is too low, which means that any song that even attempts something interesting will trigger the effect.<br /><br />Here is how the experience goes down, which is almost like getting an electric shock that you know is coming:<br /><br />- you're playing your music and it has some subtle, low parts (soundtracks, classical, ambient, etc.)<br />- there is a brief moment when the sound in the headphones cuts out, which isn't too bad.<br />- there follows a transition to harsh static at the top volume of the headphone, which is like an ice pick to your brain.<br /><br />This design, which apparently was created to save power, is completely idiotic since they didn't need to play anything at all if power savings was the objective.  The end result is a horrible experience where you just wait for the shock throughout the music.  Do not buy these."
R3RGR9PSVWSJ9U,1,"I bought this thinking the high price and brand name will get me what I want. The product worked great for first 5 minutes and then the base lost power. I tried changing the power outlets and changing the tv sets but he same reform and. When the base looses power, the head phones are filled with white noise which is very irritating to ears. I amraally disappointedly in this product and hence giving it one star."
R2343VU215ZFTP,5,clear and cocise sound with comfortable head phones. I can now watch programs with dialog again. It was well worth the price
ROVWIIW0FMG6J,5,"After reading all the pros and cons about infra- red versus RF technology I decided on a wireless RF system,because I move around the TV. My Tv is part of a great room set up,which includes a kitchen and sometimes the surrounding noise is very distracting. The Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones are perfect for me in every way.I read about some complaints concerning buzzing and fadeing. I have experienced none of that. The sound is crystal clear and never fades even when I leave the room.The sound fidelity is much better than the TV alone.Depending on your configuration of the audio outputs of either the TV or cable box,you may have to use some kind of splitter to obtain the audio flexibility desired,such as sound off on tv while sound on the headphones.The ear pieces are a little uncomfortable because the ear cups are flat.Other than that I would highly recommend this product,it performs as advertised,and the charging system is perfect when you place the headphones on the charging cradle."
R24TWLVGTR7CC1,5,"I read most the reviews before ordering my Sennheiser wireless headphones with charging cradle.  We have three TV's, but I only wanted to order one to test it out.  My husband loves listening to sports on the living room TV set and I am not a sports fan.  I would often ask him to turn the TV down and he would get annoyed at me.  I bought this for that TV and he hooked it up.  At first, he did have static in the earphones. But he had the living room TV hooked up through his giant speakers that he also uses for his CD Player.  I suggested he take the TV off those speakers and just let it work thru the TV speakers.  When he did that, there was absolutely no static.  The sound is terrific, clear, and the earphones are very comfortable to wear.  Now he can watch sports all the time and not bother me.  Also, our house has an open floorplan and the kitchen opens to the living room.  I like to turn on the kitchen TV to watch news when I am cooking.  He dislikes hearing that set.  So I ordered a second Sennheiser set for the small TV in the kitchen.  Now I can watch news and work in the kitchen and it doesn't bother him.  I credit this product for saving our marriage from discord over different tastes in TV viewing.  I was so happy with the product that I ordered a third set for the library TV.  They are real easy to hook up and all three worked perfectly with clear sound and comfortable to wear.  If someone in your house plays the TV too much or too loud, this is a perfect solution, and very reasonably priced for the quality you get."
RA0W53FYK7Q54,4,The speakers arrived really quickly and I love using them. They are clear and work from quite a distance. I have no trouble adjusting the frequency or volume while wearing the headset. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the smallest fitting was still a little loose on my head and it's nearly impossible to wear while lying down sideways.
R2W495V91Q33ZF,2,"I've never returned an electronics item on Amazon before, but it was well worth the seven buck shipping charge to get these headphones out of my life. I purchased these along with a companion RS120 headphones (minus the charger/transmitter) for watching TV at a range of only 10-15 ft.<br /><br />I played with all three channels for more than 30 minutes, attempting to carefully tune and optimize the sound and reduce the background hiss. In the end, the background noise level was comparable to listening to an FM station that's about 10 miles too far away. More frustrating was that from even 10 ft away, the best signal to noise ratio was achieved by slightly turning your head so that you were looking about four feet to the left (or right) of the screen. Beyond that, the quality of the sound is lacking. Bass is good, but the mids and highs are muffled. I have an in-ear Motorola bluetooth stero headset that sounds far superior to these headphones, and they cost only $50.<br /><br />  Other concerns: The base unit/transmitter is rather lightweight with a narrow base, and can easily be toppled over when placing the headphones on it to recharge. This never happend to me, but I could see that it might be a problem. The headphones are not completely over the ear. Rather, the surface covering the driver is flat, but the padding is missing in the middle, so it sort of stretches over your ear. Rather annoying and hot if your house temp is greater than 75 degrees.<br /><br />  I bought these headphones based on many solid reviews here on Amazon, but I am left to wonder what these folks were thinking. Perhaps they were just easy to please, but when I'm dropping $160 for two pair of headphones, I expect a bit more. I'm going to spend slightly more and get something that has a digital transmitter."
R36OA5LDBXJYQW,5,This product the Sennheiser RS120 is just what the doctor ordered. My hearing loss level is around 80% and 60% hearing loss. I can actually hear what they are saying on the boob tube without putting on the language for the hearing impaired. I would recommend this product for anyone that has a hearing disability.
RKRI02568U9A1,5,"Having a severe hearing problem, being unable to hear the spoken word, either with<br />people or TV or radio or any listening device. Needed ear phones that did not go<br />inside ear canal.  My audiologist recommend the Sennheiser R120 over the Ear<br />Wireless. I proceeded to do my own research and decided this was what I was<br />looking for so I ordered same......I have been extremely pleased with ease of<br />operation and clarity of sound.<br /><br />I priced in-store and after getting price, decided to look on Amazon.com and<br />found price to be cheaper and also received free shipping.<br /><br />Purchased a Striderbike for grandson also on Amazon at a fabulous price and<br />free shipping  and additional promo discount."
R3390NJPFS5VJZ,5,I bought this for my Mom who is loosing her hearing.  She loves it!  See wanted it to listen to the TV and this setup solved her problem.  It was easy to connect and she really likes the rechargeable headset cradle.  Now she can hear the TV and we don't have to suffer with a high TV volume!
RTVMGCZS0G2LK,5,"I bought these headphones for my boyfriend for Christmas this past year. He likes to create music and find the best quality headphones and he really, really enjoyed these! Not to mention, that they're wireless! I've used them multiple times also and I absolutely love them. The wireless range is amazing. I can go do laundry or sit in the front yard with them on without carrying a music device or tangling up annoying cords. I highly recommend these!"
R1IVQGN1Y5WOC7,1,"Used on my PC to listen when the wife is sleeping.  Temperamental and unreliable, if the audio signal fades (You Tube video ends for instance) after about 20 seconds the headset blares static and it needs to be turned off and set back on the base to reset.. also have to unplug the cable from the computer to the base.  When it works, the audio is pretty good but the frustration factor makes this a horrible purchase.  Highly recommend NOT buying this headset -more frustrating than convenient.  This morning the headset wouldn't sync up at all which reminded me to finally post this review.<br /><br />Also, the headset is rather large and the contact points are slick so if you want something to listen with while being active (besides sitting) I'd find something else.  It is comfortable but if you are doing dishes while listening then it may end up in the sink -not that I'd cry if the thing was ruined."
R1M34KLCELM2MS,2,"Worked 1 night and not the next. Pluss extremely tight. Sounded ok, not great. Foar the money they would have been ok, but since they did not work, I'll send back"
R26H22D5073TST,5,these headphones are awesome the sound is very crisp and clear and it takes highs pretty well and there is a very  very faint background noise and you cant even hear it if you are listening to something i bought these in spite of good reviews and i was right these are awesome and the people that say that there is a loud hissing noise dont know what they are talking about so i would recommend these headphones 100% all the way o and i had a pair of turtle beach headphones for my xbox 360 {which are great} that had the over the ear design so i took the padding off the sennheisers AND put them on my turtle beaches and put my turtle beach padding on my sennheisers worked out great and now i love them even more thanks sennheiser.
R1ME1L1QBG8D59,4,"I get home late and do most of my tv viewing while in bed.  My wife had always been irritated with the constant noise while she was asleep.  So I made the jump and invested in this wireless headset; boy does it make a difference.  She is able to get sleep at night and I'm able to hear everything clear as day without worrying that it's too loud.  I think I'm hard of hearing so this product doesn't just get use at night.  I tend to use it during the day when I can't quite hear a movie loud enough.  Uses two rechargeable AAA batteries that hold a charge and provide a ton of use.  I will usually keep the headset next to my bed for a week or so and not recharge it.  If it does get low and I forgot to recharge then I just swap the batteries with my cordless phone that uses the same type of battery.<br /><br />I do have a con that is there is usually some static interference, but if you work with the frequency knob and maybe the positioning of the headset (twisting the ear peice a bit) you can eliminate any noise.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product.  It's a marriage saver."
R21REXP73EN3UT,4,"I love my earphones.  I had a little trouble figuring out how to hook them up through my cable box.  I called the Sennheiser Customer Service number & talked to a nice guy who gave me some info on what to buy @ Radio Shack for the hookup.  The Radio Shack clerk didn't recognize the items I was asking for & sold me what he thought I needed.  When I got home with the equipment, I called again & talked to a different guy who said that I had the wrong stuff & told me what I should buy; I got his name.  Back to Radio Shack & exchanged the equipment.  The next morning I called the second guy, by name, and he walked me through the process, which was easy.  If I didn't live just a few miles from Radio Shack, this would have been a pain.  So, anyway, they are hooked up & I LOVE them!  The sound quality is excellent & I can wander all over the house & still hear the TV audio.  Highly recommended."
R1TEFH8AIBZTL3,3,"It's decent overall and fairly comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wires from the charging cradle are a bit excessive<br />You have to manually adjust the frequency<br />When there is no sound playing, the headphones will emit really annoying static"
R37YT6YLVEIR5J,5,"I had purchased a headset from Sony for my Sony Bravia TV.  It was a piece of.......<br />stuff, which I paid too much for and had to return the headache.<br />I purchased this headset and once you get it \\""dialed in\\"" it works great.<br />I found when watching a movie I would turn around thinking there was a someone behind me. It was actually the headset! Surround sound?<br /><br />For about 80 bucks you can't go wrong. By the way, it took about 5 minutes to set it up. 3 minutes of that was taking it out of the box."
R2I3WNCIXCXLS7,1,"I purchased this headset a year ago. Was OK when first used, but the sound clarity wasn't even good. 1-year later, the headset's battery only lasts 10mins tops.  Garbage!!!!!"
R2S4HIY1L5Q5BA,1,"I am returning this headphones because there is not a single place in my entire apartment where I can use these without ambient noise. It was very disappointing. I purchased these because of the high rating reviews, but sorry, they don't work for me."
R1GCGR3NFPTFQW,3,"I purchased my first Sennheiser RS 120 a couple of years ago and it has worked great exceeding expectations by delivering a clear, crisp consistent sound.  The new one also works just as well but not while the first one is in use in another room connected to another TV.  The sounds conflict with each other.  In other words the units work well separately and independently but they cannot be used at the same time by two different people, connected to two different TV's.  Bottom line is that if you have two of these headphones in the same house the sounds from both units bleed into each other.  Something to consider if you intend to use two Sennheiser RS 120 headphones in the same house."
R1T38YQRYVHV78,2,"I was very disappointed with this product. For $86.84 I expected more. In fact, a previous headset, Logitech Wireless Headset H760 With Behind-the-head Design (981-000265), was much better and some $22 cheaper to boot. Unfortunately, I stepped on my Logitech H760 and thus the need for a replacement.<br /><br />The item performs its intended function but it's nasty. Here are the things that I do not like:<br /><br />1. Its size! It has a cradle that it rests in when not in use, and this takes up a lot of room. The headset itself is also large and clumsy, and sits on your head precariously. It has a tendency to slide around so it's not appropriate for, say, listening to music while you work out. It's good enough if you're sitting mostly still and watching streaming video though.<br /><br />2. It is not really designed for a PC. The manufacturer overcomes this by shipping the product with an adapter so that the red and black composite stereo plugs that are attached to the headset's cradle can be used with a PC. But the adapter is very loose and is a constant source of annoyance. It comes disconnected at every opportunity and I am always having to space backwards on my show to catch what I've missed.<br /><br />3. Once the flow of sound stops, after a few minutes of silence a loud and annoying static begins to kick in for no apparent reason.<br /><br />4. There is a button that is labeled \\""Tone\\"" but it should read \\""Tuning\\"". It (apparently) adjusts the radio signal so that the headset can find the exact channel on which the sound input is being broadcast. If this button moves for any reason you will first lose sound quality and then you will lose all sound completely. (Or maybe it's just that the adapter is loose in the sound port. See #2.)<br /><br />5. The headset itself is cheap cheap cheap. It is dumpster-quality plastic. I was hoping that by paying more I'd get a good solid headset with good sound, kind of like my Bose headset but without wires. But no, it's not like that.<br /><br />6. The sound quality is quite basic. Basic is good enough for what I use it for (watching streaming video and youtube) but I was hoping that for $86 I would get good sound quality, maybe even some noise cancellation or something like that. But no, it's not like that, either.<br /><br />I've actually re-ordered the Logitech H760 even though this headset is not broken yet. But I hate it so I'm forking out another $62. I don't even think this headset is recyclable!e that.<br /><br />6. The sound quality is quite basic.

R3O5ROJWKQVUE7,5,"These were recomended by a friend and he was dead on ! I hooked base to T.V. and charged batteries as soon as I got set. Now I can watch T.V. while my wife is sleeping with the sound turned way down so it doesn\\""t disturb her but with the volume turned up in the head set so I can hear. Even works if other background noise is loud such as a vaccumn cleaner !"
R1OI770NNL73S2,2,"$80 is a lot of money, especially for a pair of headphones and sadly these are not worth it in my honest opinion.<br /><br />The audio quality is not good, most of the time it feels like im listening to my music and whatnot on an old tube tv.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothers me is that the headphones clip at high sound levels (I like my music loud) and it just sounds like some one flicked on a distortion switch.<br /><br />I've found that you need to CONSTANTLY be listening to something, not only because of the ever annoying noise that does not stop no matter what channel or tune I have it on (3 channels and a tuning knob seem really useless and doesn't help with the noise at all) But you also have to watch out for when the receiver decides to stop working and just blast static. It has happened to me multiple times. (Its that sound you get when you are changing the radio in your car and you flip to a station that doesn't come in and your ears are assaulted by an endless wave of obnoxious noise.)<br /><br />The range on the receiver is good, but for some reason whenever I have it next to me the constant noise gets worse. Going into different rooms causes it to pop or click, but its not too bad.<br /><br />I see a lot of people saying that they are very comfortable, and I feel completely lied to. These headphones feel like I have a vice on my skull, and they cause my ears to really heat up and makes it very uncomfortable to wear.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about these headphones is that they are convenient, going from room to room without having to bring your laptop or computer with you is pretty cool.<br /><br />All in all, for $80 your best bet is to save your money (I dont dare shell out money for the obnoxiously overpriced $600 model) So lets recap:<br /><br />-Not the best audio quality<br />-Not good for listening to at high sound levels<br />-Constant Noise and the occasional straight up mad static session that is an audio assault on your ears.<br />-Not Comfortable to wear<br />-They're Convenient to have"
RUQL9TMASHIL5,2,"I really, really liked the way these headphone re-charged, just lay them on the cradle, simple and elegant. The rest of the RS120?  Meh.<br /><br />The sound on the RS120 was clear enough, the ever present hiss wasn't loud enough to bother us, unfortunately, the overall volume wasn't loud enough to please us either. No matter if the volume was maxed out on both the headset and the TV (with speakers turned off), the volume was barely adequate. Neither of us is hard of hearing, but my wife wants to watch her programs in bed without disturbing me.<br /><br />Besides volume problems and despite not moving around, the headsets would lose the signal every 2-3 minutes, flooding the headset with a loud hiss. My wife would use very colorful language when she tore off her suddenly static filled headsets with a snarl.<br /><br />I finally just ran a headset extension cord (cheap on Amazon) from the tv along the baseboard to the back of our bed. We plugged in an extra headset laying around the house. No hiss, no dropouts, no lost signals and a lot cheaper. We can't walk around, but for tv watching, it's perfect. Next, bringing back 8-tracks."
R2ZAZU3KC0DQZ5,5,"We've tried several wireless headphones for our TV, and these are the best.  With others, there's been an annoying hiss if you have your head turned the wrong way, and the battery life has been poor.  With these, the sound is consistently clear, and we have yet to run down the batteries."
RSR5T4QL70IP,4,I have had my unit for almost 2 years and had no problems.  Great unit.  But perhaps even better is the excellent service.  The service department recently replaced the RCA adapter for FREE after I experienced some problems.  No questions asked.  That's what I call service.
R68VUCJIWTUB6,1,"Read the one-star reviews before you buy these. I have had pretty much every problem listed by one-star reviewers: very finicky reception, noise-blast when the auto shut-down feature kicks in, holding my head in exactly one position to maintain reception, and very high-handed unhelpful customer service.<br /><br /><<Upfront I want to say I do NOT hate Sennheiser - I also own a pair of Sennheiser corded headphones and they are great. But we're talking wireless here.>><br /><br />Just to cut to the chase, my set of these headphones are unusable - unless I only want to hear music and audio with clicks, pops, hiss, and then dead air for seconds at a time. What's so frustrating is the sound is good when it is locked in, but then, even with my head held as still as possible, the sound will cut out altogether and I will fiddle for minutes to get it to receive signal again.<br /><br />I emailed Sennheiser customer service and they got back to me fairly quickly. I was even able to talk to a service rep on the phone, but he basically implied I had something wrong with my set up. He suggested that the poor performance was because the signal into the base was too low. I turned up my signal - output from my computer - to the highest volume. That helped very slightly, but since then the performance has degraded. I have tried using these both in my office with lots of other electronics and at home. I thought maybe the problem was interference, but the performance was the same at home with just a television and stereo as in my computer filled workplace.<br /><br />This is the kind of product I think \\""I'll take it to Goodwill, but then some other poor sap will be frustrated\\"". I should just run over them and send them to the landfill."
R3G6MN6Q48RCJK,5,I am delighted to listen to my music and TV programs with this perfect product that has changed my life!<br />I love the sound and the light weight as well as the design.<br />Sennheiser is definitely THE headphones according to my long experience.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
R1F3XCTRO5EV9L,1,"I love Sennheiser, but these headphones are crap. I bought two pairs for my grandfather-in-law and both failed after he used them for a month. It's outside Amazon's return window unfortunately, and after reading about Sennheiser's poor customer support it looks like I am out $160. My advice is to spend some extra money and get a product that works."
R26JVAVDDC664D,3,"I find it Against Techy Trend ...aside from Quality estimation yet to be tested..<br />i'm not an audiophile, and my ears sleep well while in the loud club sound.. that's why i would not give any care if it sounds just around average.<br />But something from this phone that's far from the trend has forced me to write this down, which is, It's not USB compatible, Not installed battery, not fixated to the tunes of the cradle from the factory which guarantees me to calibrate it  delicately to spot \\""no hiss point\\"", channel stuff and so on... (does it actually give anyone extra-usability?)<br />and to top it all, it's useless if you were to use this for silence purpose.... since it has no ability to block the sound from within even when you wear it tight, any person in your room can guess what you are hearing with this \\""headphone\\""... no sound proof had been in consideration when this was made i'm sure of it.<br /><br />well, even though all of this sounds bad, i guess it has some \\""volume\\"" in it. maybe extra gain added up to normal. you wouldn't have problem for any sound recorded poorly that sounds so small you can't hear even when you are extremely careful to listen to it...<br /><br />well, it can SOUND that's what this was made for... good job guys"
R12Z52D0D8Z6RU,3,"I rely upon wireless headphones to watch TV while the misses is asleep, and these get the job done, but surprisingly I found much better options available to gamers.  While I do play an occasional video game, I don't ever use a microphone or anything while I play, so I never considered one of them until I started hearing good things about the digital wireless headsets available. When I tried one, I was blown away compared to the hissing found in these old school 900MHz analog models. Do yourself a favor and consider [[ASIN:B006JSPLA6 EarForce X31 Headset (Refurbished)]], which cost marginally more ($58 as a refurb when I type this) and offer better comfort and much clearer sound. You have to hear the sound to believe it. Just put the microphone out of the way and call it a day. They run off of 2.4GHz and use a WiFi signal, so if you have a router nearby (which can cause issues), splurge on the [[ASIN:B006W41X1S Turtle Beach Ear Force X32 Digital Headset]] which adds the 5GHz frequency. Either are so much better than these. Sennheiser makes great headphones, and these aren't that. They're wireless tech is lacking, and even if you take the hiss and other issues out of the equation, there just not that comfy nor is the sound (ignoring the hiss) that good. Look elsewhere, even somewhere you may not of thought of looking."
R3RFNCZQ1PXAJ7,4,"I was very skeptical before buying this product, because all my earlier wireless headset product failed to satisfy my expectation. Even a small humming noise used to bother me.<br /><br />But this product changed all my perception. It is almost 6 months and I cannot be more happy. It is very good product and sound is crystal clear.<br /><br />I am giving 4 star (wanted to give 4 1/2) just that some time (occasionally) I get very minimal humming sound in one particular direction. I checked my wireless phone and router, removed from the vicinity, but some time, I do get that.<br /><br />But overall I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it."
R316OR8ZDW7DJ5,4,"I have had another two wireless headphones in the past.  I can say the Sennheiser are OK for the price.  Sound quality is very good, I can also walk away from my TV to other rooms and keep listening better than my previous devices.<br />Build quality and charging station look nice.<br />The only flaw is that sound isolation to your ears is not great due to the flat shape of the headphone.  I wish I could have more volume wihtout having my wife being bothered with \\""still hearing\\"" the TV.  If it weren't for that, I would rate it excellent."
R2IQRS3P2LIMXN,5,New TV's have digital optical audio output (TOSLINK). The Sennheiser RS 120 only accepts analog. You must buy a TOSLINK to analog converter if you have one of the newer TV. They go for $20-$40.<br /><br /> I bought FiiO D3 digital to analog audio converter. You can view the one I bought at: [[ASIN:B005K2TXMO FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC]]<br /><br />The wireless headphones are great for the price. Now the wife doesn't yell at me for having the TV too loud. I just put on the headset and everybody is happy.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone wanting wireless headphones at a great price (and peace at home).
R25FKTFUYF8TV1,5,"They work as intended.  Good sound for stereo headphones.  Easy to set up, pretty much worked for me right out of the box.  Good range in my house, can walked 20 ft to my fridge without missing a word.  Since they are 900MHz, they don't interfere with my 2.4GHz wireless router or vice versa."
R300GJ9HZDAP70,1,"Have bought and returned three of these Senn. RS120 to Fry's. The cubby hole in the rear, where one is supposed to insert the AC plug is sooo small it's almost impossible to put human fingers in there to insert the plug. After I tried and two of Fry's techs tried, finally a thin, young lady was able to insert the AC jack. Guess what! No power, no lights, nothing - ON ALL THREE MODELS!<br />Don't bother with these RS120. It is a very bad, mal functioning design that just plain doesn't work. At $100 there are much better choices."
REZPUUDM12ATL,4,"Let me start by saying you won't get a better value from any other wireless headphone in the market, for the price you are today paying for these this is a must have headphone.<br /><br />now here's the thing  these headphones are not made for every use or everyone's use, these headphones can be great for some things but awful on others, i Took the time and tested them with several components, devices, situations just to find out what these headphones are and are not for :<br /><br />So what are these headphones for?<br /><br /> 1 -Music listening < Great sound quality will be amazing , the lows won't be so clear at times but the mids and highs will be stunning , however you have to keep in mind that these headphones won't work fine just taking them out of the box, you have to take your little bit of time setting them up ( tuning them up )  , i believe and assure that they will work perfectly with the right set up, For Hip hop listeners and people that like bass but want a wireless headphone, this is it, these have great base , it's there and it's noticeable but it's not overpowered , the sound it's very very clear and it will let you appreciate your music completely.<br /><br />2 -  Tv / Movie listening, Great for that as well, it will give you everything you want from listening to your tv or movies, it does comes with everything you need to hook up to tv's and dvds as well as amplifiers and stereo devices.<br /><br />Now what is this headphone NOT FOR?<br /><br />Not for gaming,  Unfortunately  it won't be a great headphone for gamers , yes it will work but i won't recommend it for gaming, it will not give you that clarity you need when playing fps games or something like it.<br /><br />Not for traveling of course, as you can see the base station it's pretty big, you don't want to be going around with that thing , besides it needs power to work so overall this is not a travel headphone, it's more an indoors device.<br /><br />Not good for online video listening, It will work but there's a problem, When you are watching online videos as youtube for example you are constantly going from one video to the other, or you will pause your vid to read / write a comment, what happen is that whenever the headphone stops receiving sound from your computer or tablet  it will start making a pretty annoying frequency sound, this sound will go away  completely once the headphone starts receiving sound again, however it is pretty annoying when you're not listening to anything, you just have them on your head and this noisy sound starts coming out, it will force you to constantly turn them off and on so overall not recommended for online videos.<br /><br />Here are some pros and cons;<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Great for music  and Tv<br /><br />Very attractive design ,'' looks pretty nice''<br /><br />Light weight and comfort for people that like on the ear headphones, i personally prefer Around the ear headphones but that is up to you.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Low range, sennheiser claims around 150 ft but i would say it only offers around 80 ft,  after 80 ft or so it will start dropping off and making unpleasant sounds.<br /><br />Not very good quality plastic,  Compared to other sennheiser models as the rs 170 for example the plastic on these is kind of cheap, it is not very flexible, you better take care on them and don't try to twist them or they can end up in half .  Me personally i take care of my stuff so i feel these will last for ever, no problems there.<br /><br />The earpads are made of some fabric material, not the most comfortable material around , i would prefer softer earpads but these are not bad , it will depend on you and what you like.<br /><br />Overall i strongly believe with the right set up these headphones are just great for the price, other wireless headphones out there from different brands and at a similar price are just crap, so if you don't have 250 to 350 dollars to spend on some Rs 170s, Rs 180s , Beats bydre wireless or Sync by 50 then the Rs 120s will be perfect for you dollar by dollar it doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Any questions? fell free to ask, regards."
R214458P94UQ5Z,5,"SITUATION:  My wife is hard of hearing in both ears and has a problem comprehending some TV dialogue, especially whispers.  She does not like to wear her hearing aids while watching TV.  She needed a comfortable and affordable amplified listening device that would last up to five hours without the need to be recharged.  Using TV Ears initially met her audio needs but, even with new battery packs, TV Ears batteries quit after three hours or less of headset use.  After carefully comparing the wireless headset products available, the Sennheiser RS120 was chosen to replace TV Ears.  There were concerns: the 106 db RS120 ratting might not produce enough volume (TV Ears puts out up to 125 db) and some users did report  problems with the RS120.  But the RS120 seemed to be the best solution overall for a moderate price.<br /><br />INSTALLATION & SETUP:  It took only a few minutes to replace TV Ears with the Sennheiser RS120 system.  The RS120 audio cable was plugged into the audio output of an LED LCD TV. (The various audio adapters provided were not needed but Sennheiser is commended for trying to minimizing trips to RadioShack in search of the right adapter.)  The RS120 power supply was plugged into the wall and connected to the unit.  The AAA 600mAh batteries furnished with the RS120 were replaced with fully-charged NiMH 800mAh batteries to insure maximum headset operating time between charges.  The TV was fired up, headset turned on and tuned (just once), and the volume was adjusted to a comfortable level.<br /><br />RESULTS:  The RS120 exceeded all expectations.  My wife was very happy with the RS120.  The sound quality was far superior to TV Ears.  Battery life easily met the five hour requirement.  No pops or clicks have been detected while using the headset.  Yes, the RS120 transmitter shuts off after five minutes without sound input but it has never shutoff while a TV program was running and it restarts almost instantly when audio is present.  Unlike TV Ears, there is no hiss during normal operation.  There is a noticeable headset hiss when the transmitter shuts off but it is not loud and has not been a problem.  If the RS120 has automatic gain control (AGC), it is a blessing in this application as it makes low level dialogue easier to understand and prevents loud sounds from blasting through the headset.  The available headset volume is more than adequate.  Headset tuning is simple and stable.  The headset is very comfortable to wear.  The transmitter readily charges the headset without requiring more than placing the headset on the cradle.  (TV Ears headsets had to be wiggled in the transmitter slot to ensure charging.)  The RS120 wireless RF feature is a bonus.  My wife can get up and move around, even to another room, and continue to hear the TV well.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:  I recommend the Sennheiser RS120 to anyone who wants to hear hassle-free TV audio through headphones including those with mild hearing loss.is no hiss during normal operation.

R1SK206P1UZZA0,1,"The product did not work well.  I experienced interference, loss of sound from one headphone and battery issues.  You may get one that works, but I did not."
RDVEY7D157Z48,2,"I'm a 60 year old male, wife hears fine, I don't.  She wants the volume low and I can't hear.  I thought this headset would solve the problem.  Wrong.  Two problems.<br />1. About every 15 min. the unit stops sending a signal. I have to disconnect and reconnect the cable to the audio out to regain the signal.<br />2.  The Major problem is that the headset volume is pegged to the TV volume.  Turn up the TV and you  higher volume on the headset.  Turn down the TV volume the headset volume goes down. I can't adjust the volume up enough to really hear when the TV volume is set low.  If my wife is not in the room I can unplug the audio in cables to the TV and turn up the volume to hear.  But this only works if we are not watching the same program.  So much for sharing the same program.<br /><br />Headset is comfortable and sound quality is good but volume control and transmitter are not up to snuff."
R1C3ZUPH5A7BTZ,4,Helps with noise control if someone wants to go to bed early.  I can listen to a program and my husband can sleep in our loft bedroom that is open to the living room.  The only thing I can't figure out is how he can use it to hear better and keep the sound on for others at the same time?
R2QQ1838K991Y3,5,"We bought these wireless headphones primarily for my wife, who likes to be able to leave the room without missing any of the TV audio. She's very pleased with them. Good range-- she can go to the other end of the house (or out into the yard) and not miss anything. Another benefit-- she says the quality of the audio (music especially) is much superior to the audio coming through the TV speakers."
R1GQ4ZF7FKANNJ,1,"Counting on quality from the Sennheiser name, I was disappointed as the transmitter wouldn't power up. I sent the item back and purchased a pair of wireless headphones at the mall from Brookstone and they work fine."
RUW98HSNNQI5P,1,"I have had the predecessor to this product for five years and loved it.  Unfortunately, it finally bit the dust, so I went on Amazon for a replacement unit.  I am VERY unhappy with this piece of junk though.  I will be returning it and looking for some other product to fill my needs.<br /><br />To set the stage, I use this to listen to an iPod at work.  I am a software developer, surrounded by 3 large monitors, with the transmitter sitting on the side, about a foot from the nearest monitor.  This worked great for years.  This product is worse because:<br /><br />1) The headset now uses a continuous dial to tune to the transmitter.  It used to be a 3-position switch that you matched to the 3-position on the transmitter.  Set them the same and forget it.  Now you have to set the transmitter, play some music, tune the dial on the headset for maximum reception... and don't move.  You actually have to tweak it occasionally to keep it tuned if you move around very much!?<br /><br />2) The tuner on the headset is right beside the volume control.  It was always this way, but now they are both rotary dials that feel the same, instead of the tuner being a solid 3-position switch.  Very easy to touch the tuner instead -- and have to retune again.<br /><br />3) The headset is much harder to charge than before.  I used to just set it on the transmitter when I left for the day, and I knew it would be charged when I returned. With this new unit, it doesn't really make good contact.  I have to make sure the charge light is on, then wait a few seconds and make sure it doesn't go off.  If it goes off, I need to reposition the headset for a more secure contact.  I have twice come to work to find it stone dead and unusable because the contact had slipped off.<br /><br />4) It is MUCH less comfortable than the prior headset (and the old headset won't work with this transmitter).  I have a large head (7 3/8\\"" hat size) and I find this thing squeezes my head.  No band to adjust the width.Try to stretch the metal out and (of course) it just springs back.  Also, the ear pads are less comfortable, and do not conform to my head like the prior unit.<br /><br />5) The sound is TERRIBLE.  OK, this should probably be first, but I wanted you to read all the other faults, so I put this last.  There is a repetitious screech that can be heard every few seconds, then goes away (for a few seconds).  I am pretty sure it is the crappy AGC circuit.  I mostly listen to light rock, pop, jazz and the like.  If the music gets even slightly more quiet for a moment, this sucker cranks up, then slams down the gain again when the music returns to normal.  The result is a horrible listening experience.<br /><br />6) It just goes over the top if the music is turned off.  Someone comes up to me to talk, and I press pause on the iPod and take off the headset.  It will go to auto gain and screech so loud, it disturbs our conversation when it is sitting on the desk!  I have learned that I have to turn it off before turning off the music to avoid this.  I then must make sure I turn on the music BEFORE I turn on the headset, or I will be hit with that squawking again.<br /><br />It seems they let an intern design that Auto Gain Control circuit, and never bothered to do QA on it.  I can't imagine any other way something this bad could have gotten out in the field."
R16WTVUFZAQTGE,2,Worked OK but stopped working after 5 months. I attached the headphones to my TV so my poor hearing would not cause problems for others. Used them intermittently every day. For no reason transmitter/charging station stopped working. Can't recomend these wireless headphones.
R2YOQ89FA49AP5,1,"I hate this headset, but after 90 bucks I refuse just to throw them away. I tried all possible frequencies and its impossible to hear 1 single song without the annoying interference noise. So I keep trying to use them, which makes me hate them even more. Do not buy this."
R2OUH8GWX138MK,5,"Excelent sound and easy control and fits a smaller head when needed.  I like the charging station especially.  I found the tuner and sound controls perfectly placed, and comfortable ear pads.  I will be purchasing more of these for family members."
RBQXCTCANY1LF,2,"yeah, they're nifty while they work<br /><br />had mine for a short time and barely (3-5 times a month) use them and now they don't hold a charge.<br /><br />also, some idiot thought a loud white noise was the best thing to pump through these when the signal drops below a certain threshold...like an extended quiet scene in a movie.<br /><br />yeah, great job guys. hire some testers.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Screaming static when the volume drops below a certain threshold. Not just the RF signal. Yay for trying to relax with something chill at a low level....then SKREEEEEE! SKITCH SKITCH SKITCH SCREEE!<br /><br />Sennheiser, the words I want to use for your product I'm sure I am not allowed to say here."
R1EKEIJ8VVACT4,4,I got these because of a hearing disability to use with my TV.  Sound is very good. Range is very good.  Battery life is very good.  My only criticism is that when they get older they fall off your head very easily.  The fit is based on the spring action of the headband holding them on and when it loses its spring  . . . .
R37EA1Y2Z7ZLZ7,4,"Purchased May 2012, but they died today.  Tried different batteries, reconnecting everything.  Nada.  Doubt if I'll send them back to Sennheiser for repair as the cost will probably be more than a new purchase.  They did work well when I used them, but as they did not get heavy daily use, I'll research a different brand."
R2J184PZ4P60VW,1,"I must have gotten a defective product because I found these headphones to be a terrible product.  The comfort was good and the charging doc was very cool... however, the headphones made a constant hissing noise and if I moved my head a static noise would be heard.  I was sitting within 3 feet of the base and used the tuning wheel to try and remove all of the static noise but could never completely remove it.  I also found it extremely bothersome to have audible hissing occur when I turned my head a quarter turn.  Another problem I had with these headphones was that if the audio input was not present for more than one minute a blast of static came on until the power switch was flipped to the off position.  I found this unacceptable.  I use these while I work and sometimes continue a task after a song has finished only to be jolted by a terrible static noise.<br /><br />I went with bluetooth instead and I am happy with the motorola S-10 headset.  It also doubles as a hands free device to talk on my cell phone.  I'll be buying a USB bluetooth dongle for my PC."
R1Q3O84U7SG86,3,"The sound quality and reception are great. Our condo is relatively small, but the reception at the very back of the place is just as good as when sitting near the TV that's at the very front. I love the radio recharging feature. No need to plug anything in to recharge the battery when not it use. Just place the headphones on the broadcast unit's cradle, and the remote charging light comes on.<br /><br />My complaint is the human engineering. The headset fits fine when you keep your head up, but if you lean forward it tends to want to slide off of your head and fall to the floor. You have to remember not to move to far out of the perpendicular when wearing them"
R2YAAGP70IGE9B,5,"Got these for my wife to use on the treadmill in the morning while the rest of the family works, and due to the fact that multiple orders for a functioning Viewtek Wireless Stereo Headset 2.4GHZ  unit only resulted in a complete waste of time.<br /><br />For the longest time I couldn't get these Sennheiser RS120's to work - no matter where I plugged them into 3 different HD tv's.  I eventually plugged them into the AUDIO OUT CONNECTIONS ON THE BACK OF THE DISH TV UNIT and VOILA!!! THEY WORK.<br /><br />WIFE IS HAPPY!  FAMILY IS HAPPILY SLEEPING!<br /><br />No problems with reception 40-50 feet away.  they are lightweight.  good sound quality.  good volume quality!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THIS TYPE OF USEAGE!!"
R2CBDFRJA2RJR5,4,"This product connects to a television with an audio out analog plug.  It is comfortable to wear and the sound travels through walls, which means you can walk away to the kitchen or bathroom and not miss any audio.  It does occasionally have static and it is not easy to connect.  You would need the assistance of a Sennheiser representative to make it work."
R1JEP7LOLZWUAW,4,I was extremely satisfied with these headphones. It was really easy to tune in And set up. The range was about 100 ft before it got a little static.  I was able to listen outside the house.  I also liked the fact that it's rechargeable just by setting it on the stand. They have enough bass that it doesn't sound like you are listening to AM radio like some wireless headphones. For the money these are the best bet
R3PW4YPGPX46KG,5,"I had another product which one night \\""died\\"". I was unable to hear or understand the TV until my Sennheiser Wireless Headphones arrived. They are absolutely FANTASTIC. I can  now clearly hear and understand my TV programs.When not in use, it rests in a cradle which constantly charges the headphones. I can't rave enough about this product. If you are experiencing difficulty hearing and understanding your TV programs, purchase the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones. You won't be disappointed."
RRSDUY2ZFQ80F,3,I have now ordered this product twice. They work very well while they last but they don't last very long. I ordered the first hesdphones in early December 2011; by the end of April they were dead. I like to wear them while I am working around the house or garden so I can hear music or a TV show. They has a good range and deliver a clear signal. However I found they have a tendency to fall off my head when I bend over to do something near the ground. After about the sixth such fall they were dead! I bought another one and I am going to rig a neck or chin strap to hold it.
R39BWO7OKRALX6,5,"These are excellent headphones.  No problems with installation, set up or use.  They are very comfortable to wear.  I would buy them again."
R1SF7DDX6EZI0R,1,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas and they have never worked. Contacted company for assistance, but they were wholly unhelpful and unwilling to do anything about it. I will never purchase a product from this company again."
R1NV8TU3WUXLEI,1,"These have to be the worst designed headphones I've ever purchased.  Unless you have a head that is sized and shaped perfectly for these, expect them to slip and fall off at the slightest tilt.  Both my husband and I use these and it is horribly frustrating when you need to reach for something or move about and have these slide off your head.  I dont understand how these have gotten such high reviews.  On a positive note, the charging cradle is great because Ive owned other wireless headphones and it was always a pain setting them down just right to get a charge but that is small consolation when having to deal with these falling off all the time.  They are EXTREMELY expensive considering their quality and design flaws.  I would have expected something leather-like which might have provided better grip.  Instead, you have some sort of cheap foamy material.  Do not buy!"
RIKVXDV7YZ5HY,5,"The product is everything and more. It's a little bulky and in my environment there are no traces of interference. It merits a Four Stars Plus, considering its contained price."
R1GG82ZVWQ48BL,4,COBY PRODUCTS HAVE ALWAYS WORKED PROPERLY FOR ME THIS RADIO/ MP3/CD PLAYERS TOPS THE OTHER TWO WELL WORTH THE MONEY!
R1WIET9TON0DPG,5,I am using it with my Samsung 40 inch 6100 series TV. All I had to buy was an RCA extension cable. That was it. Takes less than 5 minutes to get it working.<br /><br />Sound quality is amazing.<br /><br />I use it in my gym and I am loving it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it for home gyms.
RV5OKY84LOLGK,4,"These work very well for the price. The sound is good, no static with my setup and easy to install. It's not home theater acoustics but at this price the quality is great."
ROY3H9GO5EYN7,5,"UPDATED/Embellished on 11/11/2017:<br /><br />Ten Stars!<br /><br />I always read reviews here prior to moving ahead.  I read many of the one star reviews on this product, however, another thing I consider is the number of 3 or less star reviews compared to 4 and 5.  So I took a chance and must say these headphones are working very well for me.  The range is awesome with hardly any interference, the battery lasts long enough and the cycle of pleasing is sufficient.<br /><br />Seems most of the negativity is based on the unit being difficult to the right frequency. The tuning wheel must be turned very slowly, as it's covering many frequency bands with every tiny movement. Not difficult at all if the tuning is done slowly. This is FINE tuning.<br /><br />As for the range? It's unbelievably good. So long as the base is not in a metal room, in your average house with drywall you can easily walk to every part of the home, garage and yard without losing the signal. Of course if there is a lot of metal, chain link or if the base is in a bomb shelter, the range will be less.<br /><br />There is also an additional bank of frequencies available simply by flipping the switch on the bottom. More than enough tuning capacity to meet most every, if not all applications.<br /><br />Negative reviews regarding hiss are either caused by poor  transmitter location and/or improper frequency tuning. Also, it's important to know if there is no signal going into the system, there is nothing to transmit but static, and that's exactly what you'll get! When the audio signal is interrupted (pausing or stopping a DVD, TV powering off, etc.) The headphone system will &#34;time out&#34; after no input signal is sensed after 2-3 minutes and you will indeed get bombarded with white noise / static. THIS IS NOT A DEFECT. If there's no &#34;sound&#34; going into the system, there's just dead air being transmitted. Dead air sounds like this: &#34;Swishhhhhhhhhh!&#34;<br /><br />Another complaint had to do with extreme difficulty hanging the headphones on the charger/transmitter/base. If the base is level there is no problem. I did however experience what one reviewer documented, which is having to tinker a long time hanging the headphones on the base until the charging light would stay on. Over the years the metal strips on the base (which charge the headphones) can and will collect dirt or tarnish. I used a jewelry cleaning rag to shine them up and once again, just plopping the phones on the charger is all it takes.<br /><br />Someone mentioned the volume and tuning wheels are too close together, but they're not too close so long as you're careful. If you're wearing gloves or have 5 thumbs on one hand, yes, you will have trouble turning the tuning and volume separately.<br /><br />Only thing for me is the light weight of the headphones. Overall this is a merry thing, except when I need to tie my shoes or swing my head around wildly (which I often do when reviewing here).  All in all the price, comfort, function and sound quality are awesome, and that's a word I use way too much, just like most you all.  Enjoy these, you will not regret a day in at all.<br /><br />As of the time of this embellished input of informationary review for your reading digestion, I've had my set over six years now. I have moved 3 times and have obtained phenomenal signal in all 3 locations. I've sat in my car outside, walked around the house, every room, upstairs, downstairs, etc. (basements might be a problem) out in the yard, etc. As I mentioned earlier, the transmitter must be in a suitable location, away from AC lines, metal, and formulated ionic sentries, etc.<br /><br />The tone is excellent! Better than the TV speakers. The original rechargeable batteries lasted almost 3-years before they quit. Easy to replace. You can even replace the rechargeable batteries with regular batteries, just DO NOT hang it on the charging station.<br /><br />Also! Additional headsets can be purchasedand will work off one transmitter, however, since additional headphone sets cost more than the entire kit (with charger/transmitter), I'd recommend just getting two kits just because.  Best if plugged into the external speaker output on your TV, then the TV can be turned down as these have their own volume. Multiple headsets are a great if you rent, have kids, rent from kids or have other reasons to keep your TV volume lower than any particular need therewith. Only thing with multiple headsets would be the recharging with only one base. Guess what? You can put [2] regular AAA batteries in the additional set(s) and forgo the recharging in those set(s).<br /><br />Considering the excellent tone and range, the excellent reputation Sennheiser enjoys, all this $300 level quality and performance for less than $70?<br /><br />Geez! Such a deal should be kept secret, so, please don't tell anyone!"
R3J2FAZ0EWVB5,4,"I have been using the device for about a month now and it's definitely better than the one I had before which is a old transmitter and I have to replace the battery every month and the sound quality was awful, this one is a lot better  but also have some problems.<br /><br />one thing that really annoying me is that if  the device you connects to the transmitter did not generate any sound for about 5 or 7 minutes the transmitter will become idle, then you will get some kind of static sound from your headphone.<br /><br />In my home my setup is to connect my PC to my big screen TV,  most time when I am on my PC  I'm reading news or checking my email so there are no sound generatores from My pc.<br /><br />But as long as you're able to generate some kind of sound through your Device at connected to the transmitter it will reactive the transmitter.<br /><br />Overall I do like it, I think it's much better then the old one, I hope this review somehow helps. Good luck for your orders and have fun shopping at Amazon.com"
R1KJ7ITX0030MT,1,"While this product worked well, it stopped working after 6 months.  There's 70 bucks down the drain.  It also falls off your head if you aren't wearing a hat or have a lot of hair (I happen to be bald).  I am extremely disappointed in these headphones."
R5N03QKYWSYDK,4,"This is a great wireless headset for the price. Thats about it. You get what you paid for.<br /><br />Rather than opt for some cheap, no-name wireless alternative, I trusted Sennheiser on this one and I don't regret it whatsoever. Now, the headset doesn't have the same kind of quality as you'd expect from a wired model at this price point, but I cannot complain because the wireless works great.<br /><br />The base station is easy to setup and the range on the wireless is fantastic (courtesy of it running on 926MHz RF). Placing the headset on the station to charge is easy, and secure.<br /><br />The headset is entirely made of plastic (except for all the padding) but has held up quite well to bumps and small drops.<br /><br />Sound Isolation on the headset is pretty decent too. As for overall sound image, it seems to be catered towards the mids (vocals) moreso and thats perfectly fine since I use this product at night rather than enabling closed-captioning.<br /><br />I don't think there are better deals out there for a wireless headset. There definitely are better WIRED headsets for the price, but not wireless. I always continue to recommend these to friends and family looking for a cheap wireless solution."
R1Z8H9BT4D49P,5,"I LIKE IT, I HAD A SONY BEFORE,CHEEP PRODUCT,IT BROKE, SO I GOT THE SENNHEISER A WELL MADE ITEM, GOOD QUALITY, WOULD BUY AGAIN"
R1GVVNIXG2JR31,5,best wireless head set I've tried.<br />The ease to hook it up and the recharging system is fantastic and simple.
R286Z1PFQ3BRFC,4,"Overall I am happy with this product.  I tested the range, and I was able to walk about what the range says it is.  (However at farther distances there is more static.)  I noticed that with computer use, particularly my mac, it is important to have the computer volume down and the headset volume up.  This makes a big difference on sound quality.  I also found it helpful to put the headphone port at a central part of my apartment and at a higher location.  Don't expect perfectly wonderful sound quality.  I do not know how achievable this is over a wireless connection.  One downside is that the sound from the headphones leaks out a bit to others nearby.  In general, I am happy to have made this purchase and would do the same again."
RRY4EPJFNLZSQ,5,I am deaf in one ear and wear a hearing aid on the other and TV had become a problem. Could hear sound but not distinguish words the RS120 has been a blessing.  The sound quality is as good as the TV and can go from room to room and outside and not miss a thing. The headset is a little large but the quality of the product is worth this small objection.  Was plug and play in seconds and has great range of volume.  Would recommend to anyone especially if you have a hearing problem.  I do not have to wear the hearing aid when using the RS120.
R1EYA4RBOYURK7,5,"I bought these for several reasons, First to hear my hockey game in peace. Then i realized the sound was very very very good for the price that i paid for them. Overall I am very satisfied with my choice and no regrets."
RBVUF7E2LOOCR,4,"These headphones are good for the money. They are quite big (as is the charger) but comfortable.<br />The batteries and adapter plugs etc are well hidden so be careful not to trash them by mistake.<br />The base station plugs into the power and the TV or stereo (rechargeable batteries included) and the headset recharges on the cradle.<br />Sound quality is good, not excellent but they are not $300+ either!<br />Range is also good, you may need to do some tuning in to  eliminate the hissing.<br />Dont forget to adjust the volume  on your TV first vs  increasing the volume on the headset which will cause an annoying hiss in the background.<br />All in all, a good buy."
R1SLQZ7X8Q05AX,4,"I use my Sennheiser RS120 primarily for watching TV because my hearing loss problem requires the volume to be so high that it is annoying to anyone else in the area. Prior to purchasing this product I was using a wireless wishbone style with foam rubber ear pieces that was limited to line of sight to the TV.<br /><br />I love the fact that the range is such that I can go outside to the mail box, go to the garden in our back yard, or go anywhere inside the house and still get a very good signal. The sound quality is very good -- far superior to the sound produced by our TV itself. I connected the transmitter to the TV in my bedroom. The Sennheiser is connected to the cable box so I do not even have to turn on the bedroom TV to get the signal. If I set the cable box in the bedroom to the same channel as the TV in the family room I can use use the headset in the family room just fine.<br /><br />Although the headset is quite comfortable I find that if I lean over, like when dining and leaning over my plate, the headset is easily dislodged from over my ears. I guess that is the price I have to pay for a comfortable fit when using the headset for lengthy periods."
R25PXSE82RV0HT,4,"First things first.  I am not an audiophile, but I can and do appreciate good sound.<br /><br />I primarily use headphones for privately watching movies and gaming.<br /><br />I've owned this brand before and was quite pleased.<br /><br />I have a smaller head.<br /><br />All that being said....<br /><br />Comfort:  below average for the price of a corded pair.  They are comfortable enough to wear for hours but by far not the most comfortable pair I've owned.  They DO tend to slip off my head pretty easily with a nod.<br /><br />Privacy:  average or less.  If youhave these cranked, people nearby will be able to hear....  but for me anyway.... its not enough to make the kids stop and look the same as if I had speakers on.... not nearly the distraction.<br /><br />Sound Quality:  average for price of a corded pair.  You can certainly do better with corded headsets...  but that is not why you are probably looking at this pair.  I have not had the issues with the hiss.... but I do have mine pluggedinto a 1/4 jack on a average reciever.<br /><br />Features: above average.  This is why you buy this pair.  Three frequency channels and each has a range that can be tuned on the headset.  Range is absolutely awesome.  clear fidelity... I own 5 acres in the country and get great signal on all of it.  None of my other wireless devices interfere.<br /><br />The charging system is very convenient and you can buy at least one more pair of headsets sin<br />separate that works with the base.  However...just an afterthought... the base IS the charger so you wouldn't beableto charge multiple sets at once should you do that.  They accept standard aa or aaa? batteries though.<br /><br />In conclusion:  I would likely be disappointed if these were corded...  but they absolutely get the job done and excel wirelessly.  Better than I expected for the price."
R2V9WRU7ORLR3M,5,I researched cordless headphones quite a bit and read everyone's reviews.  These seemed to be the best quality for the price.  I love them.  They are easy to use and stay charged by placing them back on the cradle when not in use.
R2ZV8BO63F6OTG,5,"I bought these headphones a few months ago so I could watch tv or play video games while my girlfriend studies in the same room. Which makes me sound like an idiot but I promise you I am very well-read. In any case, these headphones are perfect for the job. I put them on, mute the tv and the crisp sound comes through on the headphones. I wasn't expecting them to have such high quality sound, but they sure blow the tv speakers out of the water. I've never noticed hissing except when I need to adjust the tuner. Also, I can't believe how easy these were to install and set up. All you have to do is plug in the audio jack to your tv, plug in the charging station, charge the headphones/batteries for a little bit (they say overnight) and you're ready to go!<br /><br />They're comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours, but would be better if they were more like my other Sennheisers, with extra cushioning around the ear rather than just one flat pad. I don't have large or protruding ears, but there is definitely an indentation where my ears meet the padding after I wear these for a while. And my ears turn super red. But they don't give me a headache or feel \\""uncomfortable,\\"" per se.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase, as is my girlfriend. If you have roommates who watch tv all the time and you want some peace and quiet, these would be a great idea. Also for people who can't hear well, they can use these to boost the tv's sound just for them rather than turning the tv up to top volume."
R2NS9GND9FXKQX,1,I looked at reviews here and decided to purchase.  It would not connect with my set up.  I emailed them 6 times for help.  No response nothing.  Good luck but my last email to them if your not gonna help you can have your product back.
R10QYKSMU2KSDN,5,"Very good.  84yo father in law no longer has to deafen us all while still missing most of the lines in a comedy show!  Not only could he have his own volume control, but he could hear more and hear better with these earphones because they remove any spurious background noise.  I think it has been awhile since he had really heard all the words from the TV.<br /><br />They are comfy and easy to install.  The charging cradle is clever.  All good."
R17N8MD9GPFHZ5,5,"Clear sound, strong bass and no noise.<br />I had tried Sony and Philips. This is the best wireless headphone I've ever had."
R3PU5VIZVNQ3RE,4,"The cordless headphones work well, not perfect but pretty darn good.  There's slight hissing when I lean my head and make contact with a pillow (I know, such problems in my life), but other than that they work very good.  I have not had a problem with running out of battery power and I'm guessing I've used them around 10 hours without recharging.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars out of 5, only because of the slight hissing.  This is the only pair of cordless headphones I have ever owned, so my 4 stars could easily be 5 because I have never had any cordless headphones to compare these with.<br /><br />Overall - Very happy with these headphones."
R2QQOGVITWGMY0,5,This is an outstanding product. Easy to connect and great sound quality. I bought it because I like to listen to TV with the volume up and my wife does not. This has made our TV watching much more enjoyable for both if us.
R35LK6ZYQHYKQ4,4,I bought these headphones for my husband so that he would not keep me up with his late night television watching.  They are perfect.  I don't hear a thing and he doesn't miss a line.  I sometimes use them while the kids are taking a nap and I watch a show or listen to music.  The sound is very clear and I can move all over the house.  They are easy to lay down with too. And we LOVE the stand/charger that comes with it.
R2O30G8DGSC29Q,4,"The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the ear paddings do not surround the ear completely. If you bend down with the earphones on, they have the tendency to slide off the ears. Otherwise, the sound is great!!"
R248ORMFZQXIS,5,"You can find pros and cons in the other reviews.<br />I purchased headpohones on September 23, 2008  - still working."
R1GDOHH2GR8Q74,4,"Bought these to take with me on a trip so my 'roomie' wouldn't be disturbed by my watching TV.  They unfortunately had no audio 'out' on the flatscreen TV.  Couldn't believe it so gave the headphones to the concierge to see what he could do.  Alas, no audio out!  Same thing on an LG TV in another hotel.<br />Love them at home, though!  So does my husband!"
R3RN4EG72UDO4H,5,"Have had these headphones for a month or so now and WOW, fantastic sound.  The wireless works great, no interference.  My wife and I wear these when we walk on the treadmill and I have watched Blue Ray movies with them.  There is very good bass response with these phones.  I would suggest these to anyone considering wireless phones.  Price is a little higher than what I wanted to pay, but it was worth it."
RYP1NTX9YPGP5,3,"I had a previous model of senhheiser headphones (rs136)bought in canada which were getting cranky with an intermittant power loss, due to a power switch problem. they were about 5 years old.<br />Ordered the rs120 in Az. and they're ok, but inferior to the rs136 in that the rs136 have larger ear pieces, with a hollow for your ears, whereby the rs120 have smaller flat ear pieces, that can be irritating with long wear."
R36WFOLVBP5RT1,2,The unit stopped working after 2 weeks of light use.  Quality control seems to be a problem with this unit/manufacturer.
R2MY6PE9YIHDIU,5,"I have had tinnitus for years along with a slight hearing loss and have had a very hard time understanding most television shows/movies. Turning up the volume and turning on closed caption was driving my family crazy. I figured maybe having a headset would help, but I never imagined it would help this much. As I appraise real estate, I tend to over research items prior to purchasing (drives my wife crazy) and I researched several brands. The Sennheiser RS 120 has such good reviews and are reasonably priced, I figured I would give them a try. When I received them, I was bummed I had to wait 24 hours to charge the headset, but the next day when I put them on I was in awe! I no longer have to sit and stare at the closed caption. The only con is I can't get them tight enough to keep them on while I'm working around the house, then I could listen to great music while I'm working. As soon as I bend over to pick something up they fall off. Other than that, these headphones should be on the top of your list!"
R2HGZ9FA1691P2,2,I purchased the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones RS120 926 for my husband who has a minor hearing problem. I was very dissappointed in the quality of the product and the headphones which were very uncomfortable and difficult to adjust the volumn. Maybe someone will have better luck than my husband!
RJ0T6KOQOGZW,5,Great Sound and range. Do have to figure how to keep it on your head while your moving around. Knit cap maybe.
R1VDQDR8Q7O6IX,2,"After several months of using, here are my thoughts:  the headphones are VERY warm.  Your ears will be kept warm.  If you work in a meat locker, this is good.  Normal temperatures, not so good.  Also, I get a LOT of feedback from them.  The base is 3 feet away and up no a shelf, but the static and noise is pretty bad.  When I occasionally get a clear signal (not often), the sound is average.  They are plugged in to my computer and there is nothing else electronic nearby to cause the issues.  Also, after a few seconds of no content (for example, stopping a streaming radio program) you get a loud buzz.<br /><br />The range seems to be decent (40-50 feet, consistently), but quickly fades with walls and windows.<br /><br />I would not recommend these headphones."
R2CGYUQN1D4EB5,5,"Being hearing impaired,even with the volume on the television cranked up, I could only hear a small part of the dialogue. The loud volume made it uncomfortable for anyone else in the room watching with me.With the headphones, I can here every word, and anyone else watching with me can adjust the television to their comfort level.The headphones are very clear and comfortable.I can leave the room and still follow the program. Great buy at a great price!"
R2W4PGH4KLG5IK,4,These headphones work great!  The sound is very clear and the range is far better than expected.  The only complaint that I have is that they fit very loose on my head.  They will fall off with just a slight forward tilt of the head.
R3KKOO91NNEO1F,5,this product came just as advertised and all the items with it.  They work perfectly and the sound is better than expected.
R307HJIMB2JGXL,5,"I wear hearing aids and everytime my wife and I watch tv, she complains its too loud, I also have trouble with the hearing aids applying too much treble causing the music to override the speach and making it hard to tell what is being said. I tried other smaller type items and they didn't work for me. I tried the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz headphones and finally peace  on the homefront. My wife puts the volume at the lavel she likes and I adjust my headphones to what I like. And the quality of sound reproduction is great. The headphones add some bass and I clearly hear the speach as the music is now in the background where it belongs. I strongly advise anyone who suffers the same problems I had to buy them. You will not be disappointed."
R2BLGEO0OMOKZ,5,These are great.  Good quality sound.  The batteries have not run out.  Can use them outside as well as in the room from which the sound is being broadcast.
R20SPFCH5UV6VY,3,"The sound on these headphones is very good. And the fact that they are RF instead of infrafed means I can walk around the house and the sound travels through the walls. Distance through walls is between 50 and 100 feet. Controls on the headphones work fine. The only thing I don't like about them is they sit on top of your ears. While they look like they might have the traditional cups that cover your ears,the inside of the ear pieces is completely flat and hard. This means they slide off your head very easily. So, when laying on the couch it's a little difficult to keep them on. I've never had any problems with battery life and the input automatically adjusts to line or headphone outputs so it will connect to any receiver that has a reasonably common output."
R3K69NFV92UV46,4,Easy to set up and product works as advertised. Battery seems to last about 20 hours in the on position. 8 out of 10 on the comfort level. A good value for the money.
RUX4RB7DHNZEC,4,"These headphones provide great sound for the price. Just plug the base into an AC outlet and the RC audio out from the TV into the base, and you're ready to go. Rich bass, mid tones and high end are all there. They can be tuned into the TV properly with no fuzzy interference (at least in my house, where there is also wifi internet and wireless land lines), and get crystal clear reception. The range is pretty good too for walking around, and of course since it is not LED, the signal is not line of sight, so objects or a house wall or two can be in the way without hampering the sound. There is a volume and frequency knob on the phones themselves, so you don't have to get up and down traveling to the base to adjust either one. Everything can be done from your recliner. After you use them you just hang them on the base, and it recharges them for next time. The rechargeable battery has a very long life, as I have not had to replace it yet and have had the phones a few years now.<br /><br />That said, I don't know who designed the way they sit on your head, but if I try to walk around with them, say to go to the kitchen for a snack while I am listening to a show, they slide off my head too easily. In fact, I cannot look down at all (like into the sink, or into a silverware drawer) or they slide forward and right off. They are large and somewhat heavy, but it's the way the overhead band is curved or contoured that causes the problem. Maybe the newest ones have been re-designed, but if they allowed me to walk around just a little they'd get 5 starts.<br /><br />Even so I would buy another pair. I like them that much."
RWR4T15O3POYL,5,The Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz allows for me to hear the television clearly.  I had bought a different kind/pair before and had too much interference.  The Sennheiser allows for me to listen at my level.  I can turn the television down and turn my headset up for my hearing.  They are awesome.
R11771TI4YORI4,5,"This is an excellent headphone.<br /><br />So far I have no problems, it is light with a great sound. I have it connected to the TV surround  sound and now I can hear as loud as I want since I do not have as good as hearing as my wife.<br />Another great feature is that the headset recharges while it is on the stand."
R2WBIXK808QJT5,5,"This product provides good audio range for watching movies and television programs, has rechargeable headset batteries and includes a transformer for wall power for the base unit. The headset charges best when the headset ear pieces are fully retracted. I like the tuneable headset frequency to assure good reception.<br /><br />The only negative that I see in this product is that it should be priced at about $50.00. The unit is comprised of a light weight plastic; and while everything works it does not provide the look and feel of a high quality product selling for $80.00."
R125S43PU1JBQN,4,"I love these headphones, the only down side is they tend to slip off your head if you lean over. Other than that they come in loud and clear when I watch TV, plus if you go into another room you can continue to hear the TV. I would recommend these headphones."
R333TJHRLLT1XM,5,"I'd been thinking about purchasing a wireless headphone for a long time.  It seems that every time we have company over, my wife likes to sit in the dining area with the women and us guys like to sit and watch TV.  Problem is, the women have the tendency of talking over the TV volume.  I then raise the TV volume, then they start talking even louder.  Then I raise the volume ... A vicious cycle.<br /><br />While I expected some interference, being it uses radio waves, I was impressed that it is minimal.  You have a dial on the right head set that you must tune in the head set to.  If you experience significant interference (which I didn't)you have a slide switch on the base to select one of three channels, so the anti-static noise options are built-in.<br /><br />The head phone are very light weight and fit great.  As for the sound, I've never heard stereo so well.  Wow, what was I missing for years!<br /><br />Charging is a charm.  With the (replaceable) rechargeable batteries, you just hang them on the base for a charge.  I'd estimate that a full charge lasts at least 20 or so hours of continuous use.  I've never really timed it, so it is only a vague estimate.<br /><br />Finally, for the others watching TV, I ordered extra headsets [[ASIN:B000EBPJCO Sennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System (charging/transmitter base not included)]] so they could enjoy TV also, in spite of the environmental noise.<br /><br />What can I say?  If you need a wireless headphone, this is a great buy.<br /><br />Update! Almost Two years later and they're still working great.  Batteries are original, and still taking recharges fine ... and full charges lasting long.  I've dropped these things on our ceramic tile numerous times with the worst effect being the ear cushions twisting off ... so I put it back on.  I can't tell you how really impressed I am.  Great product."
R26K8S5GVYXL2B,2,"I wanted a pair of wireless headphones I could use on the treadmill. Based on the reviews, I thought this might be a good fit. I tried to get these to work, but they just didn't. There was constant cracking and humming. I tried everything to limit it, but nothing helped. I moved the receiver, I spent a lot of time tuning, I spent time adjusting the source....nothing produced the sound quality others have mentioned. In addition to that, even with the volume at 100 on the source AV, the headphones did not produce a loud enough sound to completely block out the sound of the treadmill (or allow me to get into the workout). If you can figure out how to eliminate the hissing and cracking, these might be OK for use in bed. Other than that, I don't see a benefit. Thumbs down!"
R3CM3A3SP2GGDT,1,Range is short and if you turn your head it gets out of tune and you hear a lot of static.  When the battery discharges there is no warning- just very loud static- very loud!  Hurt my ears. returned to Amazon after only a week of use. Amazon refunded promply.
R1FQSW9J2XUHQO,1,"The sound these headphones produces is very very flat, no base. They are also very uncomfortable. After about an hour worth of use, my ears physically hurt from the lack of contour with the foam on the ear.  The range on these headphones are NOT as advertised, either. I step 20 feet from my desk, and get static. Also, if you turn your head away from the receiver, you get an earful of really loud static. These headphones may look good, but don't live up their sales pitch."
R3I5KXU0O97H61,1,"For me this thing was a complete flop. It's ill fitting and uncomfortable. It worked marginally well the first day except for a loud POP about every 4 minutes.  The second day it lasted about 90 seconds then I could only get a loud static noise after the loud pop.  The only way to get sound was to un-plug the jack and re-plug it, but then again after 90 seconds, etc etc etc."
R1OGK6FCNY3QUE,5,This was a great company to deal with. Everything went as planned nothing was wrong. Would do business with them again!
R3DP311NUXJQ8A,3,"The sound is very clear, you can hear all the details but it lacks bass which may cause a problem for movies with a lot of action in it. I recommend this for music lovers but not for movie lovers."
R2TQDKGYUXMOY5,4,"Product quality is very good, sound quality and distance range of operation also is good. I can go to my front or back yard or even working on my garage listening good classical music and it work without distortion.<br />It respond very well to low and high frequency with a good stereo quality.<br />The only reason why I cant give five star for this is due the quality of ear pads that is made from some polyester material that after 10 to 15 minutes of use it start to make your ears to get hot and causing an uncomfortable sensation of burning ears.<br />Also position of the ear pads are not adjustable to fit in a good angle to cover your ears comfortably  because the spring of the system is a little bit strong.<br />This way a pressure applied to your ears is a little bit much and the ear pad is a little hard. [[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]Other than that it is very good product for the price paid."
R1139WWQ3A31SU,5,This headset was recommended by a close friend. I ordered them for my wife so she can watch tv while I worked from home. They are incredible!
R3BD66WLYRF33J,5,Purchased these headphones for my husband for Christmas from Amazon.  They were the best gifts I have ever given anyone.  I can turn the TV onto MUTE and he can still hear his program and as loud as he wants.  It has saved my hearing and I thank you Sennheiser for coming up with these amazing lifesavers.
R39AN6U0N9PRJ,3,"The headphones work fine and the sound quality is reasonable. I found the charger base to be very convenient well worth the small cost difference from the cheaper model.<br /><br />BAD:<br /><br />1. There's a lot of low volume noise, and it's extremely noticeable when the music volume is low or there's a short break (say, in classical music). Although there's a tuning knob, the noise doesn't really ever go away.<br /><br />2. The headphones fit fine, but they don't stay on your head well you move around. Simply by turning my head they slide around a little. This isn't that bad, but I can't look down with them on or they fall on the floor.<br /><br />For the money they aren't bad, buying again I would get a digital set that go around the ear instead of these."
R3IC06ZO3VKVKT,1,"Most importantly, I couldn't get it to operate properly.  The instructions were sparse, and I unsuccessfully tried every possible connection to get this unit to function.  Additionally, the headphone and charging cradle system required endless fiddling to get a working connection that soon went away, so the batteries would not recharge."
R2ZS4IFAQJCLRX,5,The Sennheiser wireless headphone RS120 is all of what is advertised. It has a tuning dial that brings in the clearest sound with no interference. Installation is simple. Sound can be adjusted to suit your needs.
R21R81ISQBTN5L,5,"I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm 73 years old, and my hearing has been slowly fading for a number of years. It's really nice, once again, to be able to understand all of the dialog in a TV show or movie. Music sounds fine, with a good level of bass response. It's handy to be able to move around, even go outside, and still hear the sound clearly. A great product!"
R1EB833EB62FSD,4,I have found this product to have excellent quilty from low range to high<br />I would recomened this product for any one using headphones for peace to other people
R12YUSQW85BSE6,4,"I don't use it that much, but girls seem to like it. They use to listen to music while moving about the house, or doing chores. Sounds fine to me, but not top of the line, but i didnt pay that much. Seems the price has went up. Would'nt pay much more than 50. Would buy again."
R2L7H6B9WR62SK,5,Got these for Christmas - plugged everything in and it worked immediately (unlike the surround sound system I also got for Christmas :).  The station charging the headset works great. The sound is great.  I have to remember to mute the TV when I use these - the noise cancelling headphones are so good that a couple of times I didn't noticed that the TV speakers were still on.  This has been great for watching TV late when others in the house are sleeping.
R15YUMO8RIFM3A,1,"I've had luck with other Sennheiser headphones (in particular, I love the wired HD 555 headphones), but these wireless ones are just awful.<br /><br />There is a hiss on all channels, even at close range, and in a home with no other interference.<br /><br />Worse, though, is the fact that they won't stay on my head!  The flat ear pieces lay flat, rather than hooking around the ears, so they just slide off your ears when you tilt your head forward or back.  And the bar that rests on the top of your head is horrible also... even on it's tightest setting it is loose on a medium-sized head, and the padding provides no friction.  These headphones really want to slide off my head.  Definitely returning them."
R3F8E6OOV0WMHS,5,I use this for my TV as I am up late and do not want to disturb my family.  they are just  EXCELLENT!  I can walk outside and still hear the program.
R3VYE2CTYQCPMD,5,"One fine headphone, second set this one for mother, had mine for 5 years. Love um. No problems good sound, range and have yet to replace the batterys."
R2LBVIJZ8S767,5,"My mother-in-law likes to watch movies in her room but she is hard of hearing and does not wear hearing aids.<br /><br />Without the Sennheiser headphones, her TV boomed throughout the 2,000 square foot house, even though she was in a corner bedroom with the door closed. You couldn't watch TV in the living room because of the overpowering volume of her TV.<br /><br />With the Sennheiser headphones - she could hear her television clearly - and we couldn't even tell it was on if we were right outside her bedroom door.<br /><br />It did take a few minutes of adjusting BOTH the headset and the headphones to find the proper frequency - but after that, it worked perfectly.<br /><br />What a difference!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
RDVKMP7DUU7AE,3,Due to the 'open' design of these headphones they will not stay put over your ears.  Even the slightest head movement and they tend to fall off.  They will be going on eBay!!<br />They do have fair sound quality but too much bass for me.<br />Those with BTE hearing aids should avoid these phones.<br />John
R2H2YIWA2CGOXK,5,"They ask if I would rate this purchase & without knowing what was involved & clicked to do it. I know I could have backed out, but I also know other peoples feed back was important to me. The Sennheiser RS120 is excellent for us. It may not be the best for you. We got it right away, it had real good instructions on how to set it up. It works great. The sound is clear. I would buy this brand again, because I feel it is good quality. My wife is the one who uses it & she loves it. If she's happy, than I'm happy lol. She likes to watch TV in bed, I don't. I go to sleep. She can watch as long as her little heart desires & it doesn't bother me at all."
R32JDZM5V629BO,4,I've had the headphones since Jan 2012.  I would reccomend them. I mostly use them to stream talk shows while working at my PC.  Also use them with TV so as not to disturb spouse late at night or when other TV is being used(open loft with TV on loft and one in living room downstairs).  Audio is great and when I take my puppy for walks on our 4 acres I can still listen to my streaming talk shows or my statelite TV XM stations.  Breaks up at the limits of my property by I am always amazed at how well it works otherwise.  Never any hissing noise when within my home. Did have a problem with them falling off my head when I bent over to do something like pet the puppy or attach it's leash(only reason why it's not rated as 5 stars).  Quickly learned to tip them towards the back of my head before bending over and problem solved.  The docking station that charges the batteries is another huge plus with this product.  I can go 8 to 10 hours and know that they will be ready to go the next day at full charge.  I have yet to kill the batteries.  Of coarse I'm not blasting rock n roll so the lower volumes may be causing the batteries to last so long.  I've had no problems with the location of the volume and tunning controls as I've read in other reviews of this product.  I have fairly large fingers so I don't understand the difficulties others mention. I use my thumb to adjust volume and tune the headset in while holding the right housing with the other 4 fingers.
R2WZBRN7K7H36S,5,It is an excellent product. I can even walk out to my mail box that is over 100 feet away and I still get perfectly clear sound. 5 Stars.
RF7D21PRYZHYQ,2,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle<br /><br />The reviews here on Amazon appear to be mixed on this model from Sennheiser. One of the issues is the hissing that may be audible while the unit is operating. I took a chance and bought a set. Well I can report the unit I received did have significant hissing. I checked the input source (TV) with cabled-headphones to ensure it was not the cause of the hissing. I tried using the tuning feature on the headphones to reduce/eliminate the hiss but to no avail. I ended up returning the unit for a refund.
R3TTYZ37VVXJ9L,5,"Love my headphones,I don't know why I waited so long to purchase. Can now watch my TV while my husband sleeps, and he can watch tv while I sleep. The sound is fantastic, sometimes I even wear them when no one is sleeping simply because the sound is better though the headphones, especially when watching shows with music, Love love love them and find not a thing wrong with them. Thank you for such a wonderful product."
R1TOC0ND1Q75LG,5,"Due to having a partner with a degree of hearing loss (thanks to Floyd and Zepplin), watching a late-night film with sub-titles and the volume cranked WAS normal operating procedure.  In addition, missing certain films because they didn't have sub-titles was getting old fast.  I thought that acquiring a set of wireless headphones might just make life easier around here.  I selected the Sennheiser brand due to user ratings, but then faced the dilemma of which model to purchase.  I had a rough dollar amount in mind which I was willing to put out for my purchase and ended up with their RS120 model.  The instructions were clear enough, I popped in a couple of pre-charged batteries I had on hand and set it up.  The Headphones worked fine right off the bat without any adjustments.  My sweetheart was the acid test, though.  After a couple of nights went by, she recalled the night before having watched a film without the sub-titles, and never missed a bit of the dialogue.  She was very excited and I am very happy.  I have no idea how the higher end models might out-perform these, but for our purpose, I couldn't be happier."
R1Z09WUVXMAA1A,5,I bought these headphones for my husband for Christmas.  He absolutely loves them!  The sound quality is great; they have fairly good distant range.  He took trash out wearing these and could hear the tv perfectly with no interference!
R1806ZWS8SQBZO,5,This wireless headphones are the best headphones I ever purchased. The sound quality is excellent even when I go to another room in my home. You can hear every little sound that is on the tv that I couldn't hear with just the sound from the tv. They are very comfortable even for a long period of time. I told my brother about them and he went and bought a pair and says the same thing on how great they are.
R357DOIGTN33VK,5,"Incluye todo lo necesario para instalar, fácil de sintonizar y brinda un excelente sonido sin interferencias con un radio de alcance perfecto."
R1XAUM8M37HED1,5,"These are by far the best set of headphones for listening and watching TV. I've owned 2 sets of TV Ears, very uncomfortable and both sets broke in the same place, & very cheaply made. The tv ears also had to have the receiver in view to receive the signal, the sennheiser headphones pick up the audio signal when you walk out of the room. Price was also about the same."
R2AH7402071LO5,4,"A stylish headphone with an efficient charging dock system.  Good volume, good tone, good value.  Only problem: my conehead wife wishes the earpieces would fit a bit more tightly against her head so the headset would stop slipping off whenever she bends over.  I tell her to stop bending over."
RDBAZJMRVEK93,5,"This heaphones work great and help you have the flexibility you need.  Finally we can watch the same show, music or movie with a different volume level.  the sound is crisp enough vs. the convenience of having it cordless.  obviuosly there is some static but you wont notice it unless there is absolute silence in what you are hearing, and it is barely noticeable to the untrained ear, though.  I would definitely buy them again if I had the chance."
R1HIHL62Y4ILLT,5,A gift for an elderly lady with signifficant hearing loss. She loves it. Now she doesn't have to read the spoken word. This replaced an older system that really didn't do the job for her. She has all ready recommended it to friends.
R16AY9DP0PIH89,5,"I use these headphones while grilling or smoking food; primarily listening to Sirius digital classic rock.<br />The highs, midrange,and bass reproduction are great.<br />Set-up was completed in 5 minutes.<br />I saved $50.00 buying these new on Amazon.com; compared to other web sites.<br />I've been as far away as 80 yards, (outside), from the broadcast unit, (inside), and had reception; by adjusting the tunner.<br />For the money, ($79.95), you can't go wrong!"
R2ZZ3UYSE2SO7F,1,"It never was stereo. Very difficult to get the station. After 3 months, batteries died and won't work even though they were recharged. Amazon.com won't give me a refund because it expired Jan. 31, 2012. I bought this Dec. 12, 2011. Bad choice. Go directly to Best Buy and purchase in a store. Sennheiser won't do anything because it wasn't purchased through them. Having a hearing problem, these were not the best choice. Very disappointed in Amazon.com as well. No more online shopping for me."
R2YEM0NC3PDHIL,5,"The headset is exceptional, great sound, clear, crisp, and no static.  I would highly recommend this as one of the top products on the market at a very affordable price!!"
R1QPULM2J6RKG1,4,"So great to be wireless! The sound quality is about an 9 out of 10 from close range (within 20 feet of base)... Every once in a while when I'm more than 50 feet from the base, I pick up all kinds of cool sounds and bandwidths... some are police bands, some sound like pulsing static.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />The headphones also arrived faster than expected!"
R66Z8YQ1ZDCNA,5,"I bought these for my husband for christmas. He loves them and the sound is excellant. You hear more of the background sounds than you do on the tv. Like a built in stereo. Also he can put the volume at any level and the tv can be low or even off for them to still work.  Would recommend these for anyone, not just for those who have a hearing problem."
R27RKXYM1NQSBE,1,"I like wireless headphones because I can't sit still.  I garden, clean; boring tasks that don't take a brain and I listen to CNN or talk shows.  These things sit on top of my ears and fall off with the smallest movement.  If you want wireless headphones for sitting on the couch or in bed these will do fine.  They are comfortable but I wish I had sent them back the next day."
RM3QL445FTF7O,4,"SOUND COULD BE BETTER BUT ITS WORTH THE PRICE, I PURCHASED IT SO I DONT KEEP THE TV TO LOUD & WAKE MY WIFE"
RBMASHRBBHUKF,5,This is a great product! Has help me to enjoy my television viewing without bothering anyone else. I can hear everything and not miss a word! One of the best product I have purchased. Great for anyone who may have a problem with there hearing!
R2MZQ8CPX9IG29,5,I gave these to my 80 year old father inlaw for Christmas and he almost never watches TV without them. He has commented about how comfortable they are and about how he can walk around the house and still hear the program. My mother in law loves them because she does'nt have to be disturbed by the High TV volume. My father inlaw also said the sound quality is incredible and he never misses any of the dialoge on TV. He loves the fact that he can listen to music without bothering his wonderful wife. The simplicity of the headset and the ease of charging is wonderful. You can't go wrong with these headphones.
R3J4BQFC76N23Y,5,These headphones are good value for the the money.<br />Above average sound quality long batery life.<br />The tension in the overhead strap is a bit on the loose side so it may fly off your head on a sudden rotation move.
RP09ZT4NDVGVB,5,"I really didn't expect a lot from these as I just purchased them to keep from disturbing my husband while watching TV in bed.  I got tired of using CC and trying to read everything I watched and several friends said 'you need some wireless headphones' so I broke down and bought these.  I can't believe the sound!  Every little sound is extremely clear!  I followed most reviewers advice and used the RCA jacks to connect, not the headphone.  So easy to connect and when you want to watch TV, there's nothing to disconnect.  I couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend!  BTW, as of this review, the price has increased $10 in less than 2 weeks."
R2ET9UQE5GA1FK,5,"Absolutely love these headphones as well as the price! Once I figured out how to get them to work with my home theatre set up I was very impressed. No buzz or static as long as I stay within 50 feet, further than that if I remain LOS. Sitting in the room with the home theatre components they're clear as a bell."
R1YZKRZ7VFLR7B,5,"I won't even pretend to get into the technical aspects of these headphones.  I can only tell you they are very simple to plug in and get working and they give you an absolutely great sound!<br /><br />It only took me about ten minutes to get these hooked up to my base amplifier and I had them working in no time at all.  I only had to do some very minor adjustments in order to get a crystal clear signal, which I then could receive throughout my two bedroom apartment.  This means I can now privately listen to any of my source equipment, i.e. DVD Player, TV Set, AM/FM Radio or Record Player anywhere in or near my home.<br /><br />The sound through these is so excellent that several times I had to remove them to assure myself I was not somehow hearing the sound through my external 6 speaker surround sound system. And, I love the convenience of simply placing them on the metal stand/transmitter when I am finishing using them and knowing the batteries will then automatically recharge before my next use.  Additionally, these come with all necessary adaptors so you can hook them up to any standard size input. They are also extremely light and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />In short, this is a great wireless headset system at a very reasonable price.  I could not be happier with these!"
R3HK83KBNHGRN1,5,Bought them for my husband he is very satisfied with their power and clarifity would recommend them great set of headphone for the price.
R1RCG2AVIS4ZOR,4,"First,let me state that I only use these headphones to watch TV and surf the web from my laptop.  I cannot comment on range, however I cannot recommend these headphones for anything other then sedentary use.  The headphones themselves are quite heavy due to the batteries and the fact that the headband is also the charger.  Adjustment is \\""iffy\\"" and unless sitting fairly still, they want to fall off if you move your head to much.  I could not use them for working out or other activity.<br /><br />Having said that, I gave them four stars because they are performing for what I bought them for, as previously stated.  The sound is pretty good for the price.  The head phones are comfortable for short term use.  I do take them off when surfing the web.  Since I watch TV while I surf, I tend to pause TV while surfing.  If you leave the head phones on your head while TV is paused, the sound will shut off after about two minutes unless you are watching video on line.  The result is static in your ears.  You can leave the headphones on your head and shut them off via the switch or you can take them off during web time.  I find that somewhat annoying, but then I realized that the head phones were not that comfortable to wear when not necessary.  Also once you go back to video or TV (DVD etc.) and hit play, the sound resumes in about a second.  At that point I am usually ff through ads anyway!<br /><br />So, four stars for performing for MY purpose, but not five for the observations I have noted."
R3MZPI7JA1IXC3,5,Excellent product! The radio function doesn't works so good! I receive very fast. It's what I was looking for! I have a good expience!
R29XMRA3W3BWX9,5,I am very satisfied with my Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless Headphones.  The sound is crystal clear and I love the fact that it uses rechargeable batteries.  They are always ready.
R3F0CQC8K93HMC,5,Headphones sound good and battery lasts a long time.  The RS120 seems like good value compared to much more expensive 'phones.
RTLAPWHP57TTW,5,"We love these headphones.  They were easy to install and very easy to use.<br /><br />My husband is a big foreign language buff.  Unfortunately i don't speak French, nor do I want to listen to it while working on other things in the house.  He can put on the headphones and get his language fix to his content without the rest of the family stuck listening.<br /><br />We ordered 2 sets and can watch two TVs on two different floors without sound conflict."
R3MK9MQRQC03PI,5,"This is an amazing product for the price.  I can now listen and hear every thing without disturbing anyone.  The sound is great, good bass and very clear.  I have at times picked up stray frequencies but it has been no problem. I can walk around home and listen with no problem.  I am very pleased with the product as it has held up well the past three months I have used my headphones."
R2BYLEN87KRJ0,5,I enjoy this product every day to watch TV in the bedroom. My wife can sleep.  I also ordered this product for a birthday gift in late December.
RAKC8D60VANJ6,4,"Overall this is a good product.  I got them today and they are working great.  The sound quality so far is very good.  I work in an office with literally dozens of wireless devices and have very little interference.  The only issue I have had, is if my ipod is off, but the headphones are on they create a buzz, that will go away once the ipod is turned off.  The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is the fit is a bit funky.  I have an odd shaped head, so it could be me, but they dont seem to quite set right on my head."
RBBJC9GHSM0SZ,4,"We bought these to use in bed so the kids can't hear our tv, and they work well for us.  We only sit about 8 feet from the tv, but my dad walked almost a block down the street, and could still hear the tv.  That's crazy far.  We have two sets, and use both cradles for charging, but only one is hooked up to the tv, and still provides the signal for both headsets.  I'm sure there are better sets out there, but for our needs, and for the price, these are perfect."
R2BVR76MJCX5U9,5,"Great sound quality, very comfortable<br />only downside is its auto turn off feature, can break your mood hearing those distortion sounds."
R2KIE197616BP2,5,"These things are fantastic great sound and nice to wear around the office and be able to walk around, go to the printer and not be stuck to the ear bud cord length,"
R1TIDMBQB2XSMY,5,"I gave these to my husband as a gift for Christmas.  He says they are the best gift he has ever received.  We live in a very small house with three small children, so hearing the tv was not possible.  The first show he watched wearing them, he said it was the first time he was able to hear what the people were saying.  The kids can be two feet away tearing down the house and he sits in blissful peace smiling like an idiot.  The quality seems to be good, love the charging system.  My father also has these, my mother loves them, she doesn't have to listen to what he is watching in the basement anymore.  I was amazed at the sounds I have been missing in movies.  I don't know if these are the best sound quality out there, but for our purpose, we LOVE them."
R17K30DEAF85QA,5,This is an great speaker. Sound quality is very good. Apart from a very rare distortion which I experienced a couple of time till now. Its gr8.
R3H3DWVFGSEM7S,5,"These were a gift for my son, and he uses them to listen to music while he is studying.  They block out other extraneous noises and give him the peace he needs and wants to have while using them.  He also uses them while playing games on his computer, keeping the rest of the family happy at not being bombarded by the games various noises and sound effects.  He loves them.  I give them 5 stars and 2 thumbs up."
R1AFB13WA2LLCI,4,"Headphones work very well.  Excellent range and sound quality.  Control dials a bit inconvenient and awkward, but fine otherwise.  Great buy for the money!"
R1MNH5LN23T381,4,"Easy hook up based on clear instructions and reasonably user friendly product. Clear reception and good sound quality. The only draw back is that the headphones may occasionally slip from the head.  Still, met most of my expectations."
R1DQBDL5SJA7U7,5,"Great wireless device - no nonsense - just superior audio, comfortable design, fast re-charge!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
R3M8QVZUUTJTUF,1,I purchased these and had hissing problems.  I tried both at work and at home.  It seems wireless headphones (at least these) are not anywhere close to wired in terms of clear sound.  It was very disappointing.<br /><br />The charging dock is neat and really works.  If only the sound was good these would be worth it but as it is I recommend avoiding them.
R389SO1COTH7WC,2,"I purchased these headphones because I hate having cords strung over the floor to my couch. I live in an apartment building, and I was aware from reading the reviews that interference might be an issue. The first time I used them, I picked up some sort of radio program when tuning. I finally found the correct tuning to listen to my tv program. There is a lot of background hiss in these headphones, even when correctly tuned. Now, that may be expected from wireless headphones, BUT it gets worse!<br /><br />When you lose the signal, or when you pause your dvd player for a few minutes, you will get an eardrum shattering HISS unexpectedly and much much louder than the background hiss which is present all the time. So if you value your hearing, don't pause your DVD player while wearing these!"
R4PWEJB0N29TC,4,I am very pleased with the headphones. My purchase and shipping with the seller I thought went very well. The setup and headphones was easy and quick thanks to reading other reviews.
R2EVG02B9Q3GHO,5,"Featherlight , incredibly comfortable headphones , crystal clear sound with plenty of bass and treble response are a few of the ways to describe this 5 star wireless set.<br />A few tips....<br />The Germans are renowned for excellent incredibly well engineered products that come with lousy operator directions.. This rig is no exception.<br />They don't come right out and say that the little 3 position switch on the front of the transmitter( that is almost hidden)  allows selection of one of three channels and that rotating the tuning dial on the headphones allows you to 'tune in\\"" to the selected channel.<br />When I first used my set the sound was terrible ( the switch comes set to Channel one. When I switch to channel 2 or 3 and re-tuned the sound was crystal clear and Spectacular !<br />WARNING...be careful when you open the compartment for the batteries. DO NOT pry it or you'll break the plastic mounting tabs. It is opened by simply rotating the foam ear pad counter-clockwise about a quarter of an inch and voila ! off it comes.<br />The batteries MUST be charged for this unit to work properly. If you're like me , you're impatient to try the unit out and don't want to wait for batteries to charge so what you can do is just install conventional alkaline batteries and put the rechargeable batteries ( that come with the unit)in an external charger if you have one.<br />The alkalines will get you started immediately but WARNING! Do not put the phones in the charging cradle !!!  When your done playing around, put the rechargeables  back in the headphones then you can place it in the charging cradle .<br />One last warning... the AC power 'brick' is in a little white box\\""hidden\\"" in the packaging. DO NOT throw out the packaging  until you find this device. I almost did.<br />I read a lot of complaints about hissing and bad sound here. I believe that if all those dissatisfied folks experimented with the three channels and their tuning, their problems would go away.<br />This is a really great headset that's guaranteed to stop screaming neighbors and wives when your watching the \\""Blues Brothers\\"" trash the city of Chicago at 3 AM on your big screen. I'm luvin'em.<br /><br />Forgot to add.... that because this device uses RF( radio frequency)  and not IR ( infrared light)it is like a mini FM radio station that allows you to plug it in any audio source and listen to it while your out in your yard doing whatever. The range of this little jewel is over the length of a football field..Wow !!Mowing the lawn just became a rock concert."
R3DLF80R2R18O6,5,"Once in a while the headphones will pick up a hiss from interference but it is pretty rare and it is caused from sources outside the headphones.<br />I found the headphones to have very good stereo sound and good volume. I have not tried any long distance listening, just traveling from living room to kitchen etc, and phones stayed connected. My connections are from the TV audio out RCA jacks. I also have had problems turning the tuning dial instead of the volume dial as they are next to each other but that is not a very big problem as once volume and tuning are set to your comfort level, all you have to do is turn them on and off. I also noticed it has a power saving mode. When TV is paused for about 2 or 3 minutes the headphones power down with hiss in the earphones. Starting the TV back up turns the headphone master unit transmitter back on automatically. I would recommend these headphones and believe they are worthy of a 5 star rating."
R2QGQ0ISCVIW7T,5,"I've read all the reviews (1 star & 5 stars) before deciding to give this a try.  Set this up with the hotel's TV (Philip) in Florida and couldn't get it to work.  Back home connected it to the satellite box, works right away, without any tuning or adjustment.  The sound is so clear & crisp, works even in the next room (concrete walls),  charging station is simple to use, the only fault I can find is that the ear parts do not really \\""envelope\\"" the ears."
R2ZO1N72HL4G21,4,"This headphone works as described. It has good range and works perfect for me. AS with any other RF headphones, this one too is susceptible to interference. I had this initially placed near to my TV and had lot of interference. I bought this to use it with my Home Theater system and works without much interference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice sound quality<br />-Long range<br />-Drop on the charging station and it charges without your notice<br />-Controls on the headphone<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Interference on close proximity to TVs etc (this is not unique to this one, common among RF headphones)<br />-Leaks sound out of the headphone. Others on the same room can hear what your are hearing!<br />-The sponge on the head-top portion is not that comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, this works for me to listen to music while I am on my treadmill, bed etc. Watches TV on  projector without disturbing my kids during their homework time:)<br /><br />Amazon, as usual ships it fast! Thanks!"
R3JOR6RNSABMN,4,"[[ASIN:B003LPTAYI Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)]] Great for tv. My wife complained about the tv volume, so I bought the RS120 headphones by sennheiser. Now we have a peaceful home again. At first I had a problem with the headphones shutting off if the tv volume is low. I finally found a way for them to work. This is the only fault I found with this product."
R35EHZBO49MDBR,4,"These headphones work very well.  The sound is excellent and can be heard up to a couple of hundred feet away from the source.  My husband likes to listen to talk radio shows while otherwise engaged, and he likes that he can wander around the house both inside and out.  The only drawback is that the headphones are made for a much larger head than either he or I have so that when you lean forward or backward, the headphones slide off of your head. Is there a solution from the manufacturer for this, or do I have to get creative?[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
RI9WPB8ZI0Z7T,5,"I tried three different wireless headphones...the Vizio bluetooth, a Sony wireless, and the Sennheisers.  All sounded fine, but the Sennheisers are COMFORTABLE.  With the others, I was constantly trying to readjust...couldn't relieve pressure on the ears.  These are excellent...and the price is right,too."
R3046OLM7EM6TC,5,"Sennheiser RS120 is a perfect choice to whom love the wireless technology and seeking at a good price product at this moment. RS120 provides an easy way to connect with your audio device, and easy way to charge its battery with the optional wall mounting docking station. And most of all you will look cool without lines and strings touching your body.<br />However, RS120 is not a perfect choice to whom love to listen to best music or gaming (to which I mean it will give you a clear and strong bass, details of the high node and clarity of noise). You will get upset a little bit if you decide to buy this product because it only give you a standard output of voice.<br />I am writing this piece of review to let you know I feel good with the RS120 when starting to use because my aiming for the product is first - the wireless technology, and second - that product also has to offer me a good price."
R2YPVBFNTJ2Z6G,1,"I have another Sennheiser corded stereo headset. Great headset HD450II. This headset will not stay on my head unless I am froze in my seat. I know Sennheiser can do better than this headset. Great sound easy to use, great way to charge the headset, just that the headset is not what I thought it would be. I have considered returning for a refund! So far I have not done so!"
R1UNXIOLM6DJHK,5,I like my headset very much I use it very often.It does seam to be a little on the lose side but it is not to tight.
R1SEHH67XVSSL3,5,"I'll say one thing for these, No More Loud T.V.'s!!!!  I was one of the most thankful people around when we received these.  Hubby loves them, grandkid loves them and I do too!  You won't hear our t.v. at the road anymore!!  All wives should get these for their husbands!!  Great Gift!"
RJHMK763U9CUE,5,Product performed as advertised.  Now I can hear a TV show anywhere in my house. I find my wife is using them during her normal cleaning chores when she can't be in front of the TV.
R32NUG4AJELX91,5,"I got an unknown brand for my dad at Staples Dec of 2011 and they worked OK for about a week or so and then when I tried to fix them I discovered what I had purchased at Staples was junk.<br /><br />So I repacked them and the store manager at the White Plains Staples OK'd a full refund for me long past their customary \\""techonology\\"" return period.  I appreciated that.<br /><br />So I went online and discovered that the RS 120 Sennheiser wireless headphones were getting rave reviews from over 2,400 people.<br /><br />I ordered these on Amazon and selected the free shipping on a hunch that they would arrive in time for his birthday on Feb 26th.  They arrived on Feb 24 !  Amazon is fabulous on free shipping.<br /><br />On Feb 26 I hooked them up after dad opened the gift box with these headphones.  The batteries were suitably charged already and the RS 120 sounded great hooked up to his TV.<br /><br />I called him about 4 days later to ask how he liked them and he tells me they sound great and he hears every word of his news shows and other TV programs he enjoys watching.<br />I had hooked them up to the rear panel audio output jacks of his TV.  The normal TV sound can be fully muted and the RS 120 headphones still sound great since the rear panel output jacks have a constant audio level.<br />I tried them when I was there and the sound quality is definitely rich and full spectrum.<br />Sennheiser engineers deserve much praise for producing a superb product !"
R31QQFOHYMZC4B,5,"I bought these so that my wife could listen to Law and Order without my having to endure another episode, but now I use them even more to listen to my retro rock both inside and outside the house.  They work great, comfortable, minimal to no interference, both indoors and outdoors."
R1VEBMOB5TX3D1,5,Excellent quality of sound.  Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  We bought the headphones to solve the problem of different hearing capabilities in one home - the headphones have made it possible for different people to watch TV with different sound levels.
R1IIK2Y7HT9IIX,5,My wife was always complaining I had the TV too loud and needed a hearing aid. This did the trick with great side benefits. The stereo sound is great and lets me hear suttle effects I never hear with just the TV speakers or even our stereo speakers on the second TV. The range is great as I can walk around the house and even outside without missing a thing! These earphones worked so well my wife had me get her a pair. I got another transmitter also so we can listen to either TV as the transmitters can be set to different frequency channels and earphones can discern the two.  wonderful product highly recommended for the over 60 group for harmony on the household
RLFWA0TA43M8A,4,"This is the first wireless headphones I have ever used but I really like them. The sound is very good and I can walk around my whole house and outside to the back patio and listen to tunes from my laptop. I have not tried them with the TV yet but sure that they will work great with it as well. The only issue I have is that they are a little big but just have to not get wild and crazy with my dancing! :) For the price, these are great headphones and would recommend!"
R2X06CS6DWS74X,1,i bought these in 2008.. they were total junk I was in Iraq and living in portable living units. and i lived in one small room and these headphones did not even get good reception when i sat at the desk with the receiver right in front of me? i threw them in the trash after desperately trying to make the work for 2 weeks. to bad the concept seemed great. maybe there a better brand?
R1T2J0LKYF9VCB,5,"4-24-13<br /><br />I now have 3 of these headsets and love them!  Got my last one in January 2013.<br /><br />If your earphones don't work properly SWITCH radios!!!  I have two rather<br />expensive radios of the same brand. When I got my second headset (my first is on<br />my TV) I connected it to one of my radios and it would not work properly.  I<br />tried everything and nothing worked.  The headset would work for about 5 minutes<br />and then cut out and nothing I could do would get it working again.<br /><br />I was about ready to send this headset back but decided I would try it on my<br />other radio (remember, same brand).  It worked GREAT and I have not had a<br />problem with it since (it has been several months since I switched radios).  I<br />use the headset when I am out in the yard or doing housework going from room to<br />room.<br /><br />So, before you think the headset is defective, try it on another radio and you<br />might find that the headset works fine.  That the problem was that the radio<br />jack on the first radio just did not properly accept the headset connection.<br /><br />Also, remember that the headset is designed to turn itself off if there is no<br />radio sound for a period of time in order to save batteries.<br /><br />----------prior review--------<br />I have tried several different brands of headphones and these are by far the<br />best.  In fact, when I got mine I connected them to receive my radio and was so<br />impressed that immediately ordered a second set so I could connect them to my<br />television.  The headphones are so light that I put them on and just leave them<br />on as I work inside and outside the house.  The sound is excellent (I listen to<br />talk radio), very smooth - not irritating as with some headphones.  I wanted two<br />sets so when I switched from listening to a tv program to a radio program, I do<br />not have to reconnect them.  It takes about 5 minutes to connect them.  Let the<br />headphonescharge for 24 hours and then enjoy!!!  When you put the earphones<br />back on the charging stand they immediately make the connection and start<br />charging.  There is no fumbling around with trying to get them to connect to the<br />charging stand as when you place the headset on the stand it automatically slips<br />onto the connection.  Do not let the lights on the charging stand fake you<br />out...they seem to light up when they want to.  When you put the headset on the<br />stand the red light will come on.  The green light seems to do whatever it wants<br />but it works.  When you first connect the charging stand to the electricity the<br />green light may or may not come on but it is ready to charge the headset.  Want<br />to thank the person whose recommendation said he could do his neighbors yard<br />across the street and hear his program as I wanted a set that would let me do my<br />yard work and I have a big yard.  I can even walk around my block and hear my<br />program through the headset all the way.  Can''t recommend highly enough!!!!"
R1WD2Q5W0JADMP,1,"I purchased these headphones after reading a bunch of reviews.  Several of these reviews mentioned the automatic shutoff and static, but most of them talked about the sound quality, range, and how amazing these were.  I should have paid more attention to the warnings.  For what they do, these headphones are great.  The sound quality is good.  They have a good range.  I can walk all around my house, and have minimal sound disruption.  However I will never again purchase anything from this company.  The reason, these wireless headphones.<br /><br />The problem with them is the auto off feature.  If I'm actively listening to music, or watching a video, they're fine.  If I stop listening, then I have to turn the headphones off, every time.  After 1 minute of inactivity, the headphones cut off, and then begin emitting a loud static that immediately grates on the ears.  This means, you cannot continue wearing the headphones, and if you stop listening, you must immediately remove them, or turn them off, or suffer from the static.  If you are looking for a good set of headphones, keep looking.  Find one that just shuts off, and doesn't start loudly broadcasting noise when you go inactive.<br /><br />Edit: I've had these headphones for awhile now, and the auto-off feature just never stops being annoying.  I can't even imagine why they decided to make these so that if audio isn't being broadcast, the headphones should emit loud static, but for whatever reason it was, the effect of this is, that when I eventually replace these, I will certainly not be buying another product from Sennheiser."
RMF6HY60R0RKI,1,"The concept is great. The execution, not so much. I was happy as long as I didn't move from my computer or tilt my head down. If I picked up my glass of wine I hear electronic buzzing. If I bent down to look at something, usually checking on the dog, they fell off. Sheesh. Didn't think my head was that small. Probably has something to do with no ear holes. Granted, the only reason I bought these, was they looked comfortable. Ugh. They just annoyed me to no end. Can someone recommend a decent set of headphones that don't hurt my inner ear, or my outer ear or fall off my head? I am not an audiophile, just a comfortphile. I wear these for hours on end at my desk while I study for nursing school. Sending these puppies back tomorrow."
R2F54KUQTXSLMP,5,"Bought these because I needed a pair of wirelss 'phones to keep harmony in the household. Easy to hook up to the TV and took about 5 seconds to get the frequency dialed in. The sound is excellent for the money spent, the inevitable RF hiss is quite low and tolerable (with the possible exception of listening to the very soft passages in classical music), and they are quite easy to hang back on their charging stand. Sennheiser is known for its quality products, and this one does not disappoint.<br />  There were a couple of reviews here that made me think twice about this purchase. I'm glad the individuals who wrote them were so completely off base. These headphones, while not audiophile quality, give an AWFUL lot of bang for the bucks.<br />  Range of the RF is perfectly acceptable for my listening environment....I haven't noticed ANY drop-off of signal while moving around the house and listening to them.<br />  About the only advice I'd offer Sennheiser is to make the clamping pressure on the head a TEENSY bit tighter, and alter the orientation of the ear cups to the headband for a better fit on the ears."
R1YHW9PJBWEL8O,5,"Just had to add to all the reviews that I have had a pair of these for at least 10 years and they still just work great.  I leave them in the charger most of the time, use them maybe once a week and they still go for hours.<br /><br />The foam earpads are still \\""new\\"". They are comfortable and sound great.<br /><br />Absolutely no complaints."
R1NR9KGVFDZM7N,5,"I am totally happy with these headphones and unlike some of the other reviews, I do not hear hissing sounds and the other night I literally walked ouside my home and about 100 yards up the driveway and could still hear the tv loud and clear (and the set is located at the back of the building - not the front where I was putting out the garbage).  If there is one downside, I have found that the headset is a little too large for me and if I lean forward they fall off my head.  Otherwise, I couldn't be happier.  I was thinking of getting another pair of cheaper ones for my bedroom television, but with all of the negative reviews on some of those items, I will purchase another set of these.<br /><br />I am deaf in one ear and would have to put the tv up so loud that is was very disruptive for my husband.  Now, I can even put the TV on mute, put the garbage out and never miss a word.  What a god-send."
RF0GC8SAAOUL4,3,"I read many reviews of various headsets before purchasing the RS120.  These headsets are a decent pair, they fit fairly well and are comfortable long term on my ears. They may be a bit too loose, as I can't move around a whole lot without holding them on my head, or they fall off otherwise.  (They are fine if you are just sitting at a desk.)  battery life seems good, and the charging station works fine.  the range seems fairly good (I use them at work, and can walk anywhere on my floor).  there is somewhat limited radio interference, as I have been constantly trying to 'tune' the receiver to reduce some of the radio fuzz.  (it's mostly clear, but noticeable at certain times.)<br /><br />I listen to a wide range of music and talk radio, the headphones are able to reproduce a  fairly flat response, with slight exaggerations on the lows (200hzs), and a noticeable lack of highs (above 5k).  What bothers me most is the compression they introduce to the program material.  This is especially noticeable in highly dynamic music (think bluegrass, acoustic, classical)... as another reviewer noted, most people will probably not notice this, especially if you listen to music that is highly compressed already (like 90% of music on the radio).  I'm a hobbyist audio engineer and recording engineer, so I have a fairly good ear.  And I compared these to my Sennheiser HD25, Sony's and Audio Techniqas.. (all wired).<br /><br />so the title sums up my overall rating, they are good headphones, not bad, but not great either."
RGKO4R4PQTUXW,5,"Excellent headset! Set up was easy, very comfortable ear pads and sound quality is great. I am not an expert, but would recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones. My TV does not have RCA jacks out so I purchased a FiiO D3 digital to analog coverter which works great."
R6NSQH27ZN5CU,3,"The unit Sounds fine, and that is why I rated it \\""OK\\"", but the ear cups are not particularly comfortable, and the foam pads are barely attached and come loose quite easily.  I had higher hopes for a unit in this price range<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you want a fit and finish that is quality, leather, well padded, comfortable unit, this is not it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />If you want a sound that is clear, easy to use, and decent on the batter life, this is a unit to consider."
R2KHXPCZGRERRE,3,These are great for my husband who likes the TV volume loud. The headphones are quite large ... great for him but not so good for someone with a smaller head.
R3F0N21B1LAAWV,4,"I have one of these in the living room and after trying it my wife insisted she get one for the bed room.  You'll hear things in movies that you didn't realize where there, sound wise.  Fits well, sounds great, and since it is rechargeable it's hassle free.  You have to learn the control knobs, but it is not hard."
R31TB2YFOJ30BM,5,"This product is very simple to operate and install. Works just like it is supposed to. Charges quickly and lasts through what seems like hours without needing to recharge. I havn't used it till it discharged so i dont know how long it would last. The hissing is possible if you dont adjust the TUNE dial it has but when you dialed in the sweet spot you can keep it there. It has really good reach i have unit on the tv so i left outside to get something out of the car i didnt want to miss the show so i took the headset with me and i could still hear clearly, i adjusted a tad bit the TUNE dial and clear. Sound quality is good just like TV would sound with stock tv speakers."
R3UPFLJ92NH40R,4,"These headphones are awesome.  So clear walking throughout my house (and it's not a small house).  It's kinda amazing how clear and good the sound is no matter where you are in the house.  The sound quality is very good.  The bass isn't overwhelming, but decent.  Good sound quality for the price.<br /><br />The tricky part with these is getting the headphones truly on the right channel.  You can change the channel on the base, and then you tune the headphones to that channel.  The problem is it can sound clear even when you aren't quite tuned right.  This threw me off for a while as the volume was low at that wrong tuning.  I thought everything was fine but could not get the volume high at all.  I was just about ready to return them, when I tried again to adjust the tuning and found a better connection.  Then the volume was fine.  I read another review where the person couldn't get the volume loud enough so they returned them.  I'm sure they hit the same snag I did.  So if you get them and can't get the volume loud enough, re-tune them.<br /><br />Otherwise these are awesome headphones.  I'm sure if you want to spend more, you'll get better sound, but the convenience of wireless and the price on these are hard to beat.<br /><br />Also very cool how they charge when you are not using them.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
R39QY507UVY2DZ,5,"The sound quality is really impressive. I worry about wireless devices where I live because the Naval Air Station is less than 10 miles away. We're constantly picking up stray radio signals from the base and planes flying overhead, so wireless headphones, telephones, etc., haven't been very effective here. So far, it's been about a month and not one stray radio signal interrupting the TV or stereo! Also, the battery life on these things is amazing. The on/off switch, which you don't see very often on stuff like this, really keeps the battery life high. Best of all, they're super comfortable. I'm getting ready to order a couple more sets for use in other rooms on other TVs/stereos. For the price, sound quality and comfort, you really can't go wrong buying a set for yourself. You certainly can't borrow mine! Hahahaha."
R2GNRHO8XR8L5U,3,"These headphones are alright if you want basic quality sound for limited listening periods.<br /><br />Thumbs up:<br />- The product works<br />- I love being able to just rest it on it's stand and let it recharge. It's very simple.<br />- The range is alright. I get clear-ish sound all around my apartment.<br /><br />Thumbs down:<br />- The build quality is less than good on both the headphones and base station. The base station looks very ugly and the headphones feel cheap.<br />- The headphones are rather uncomfortable to wear. The pads mash your ears into your head.<br />- The audio quality is miserable. Laptop speakers might produce higher quality sound.<br />- There are always audible hiss, pops, and crackling no matter how much you adjust the channel and frequency.<br />- It's really hard to tell the frequency knob from the volume knob. Putting those two right next to each other was a seriously retarded move.<br /><br />Overall these headphones are ok. If they break I definitely won't buy another pair, but I'm not upset that I have to live with these either."
R19BWHTGMTVGWY,5,"Although I haven't had these long, I am very pleased with the sound quality.  We have them hooked up to our Dish Network box so my wife can watch TV without disturbing me at night.  We used to have an older set of Sony \\""infrared type\\""(lasted over 6 years of daily use), but these sound a lot better and have a great range.  I can't think of a negative...not for this price!"
R3DAYS8BTUC34R,5,I was looking for a quality wireless headphone to use on my television when the kids are sleeping at night.  This wireless headphone works perfectly with my TV.  The sound is clear and the battery lasts a long time.
RESENVK2WN4EB,4,Bought these so that I could work out on my bike trainer and watch TV/movies/etc. without blasting out the rest of the house.  Sound quality is excellent.  Comfort is great and they stay on my head during even when sweating.  A great combination of performance and price.
RPVZIPDAH25NM,1,"We have tried two different new headphones and neither would continue to transmit after 10 minutes of usage.  I would not recommend these headphones to anyone.  They were a gift and the second time through, we even tried them on multiple television sets to see if that was the problem.  I would like my money back."
RHAI15BPN43X5,3,"I thought it would be great to have this to use with my computer and TV. I've had them about a week now and am not impressed. My last wireless headset was much better(asus travel lite) but not made as well.<br /><br />Sound, not great but wil work for TV. If you want to listen to music on them or watch movies I'd look for something better. The sound is very thin for lack of a better word, no depth or richness.<br /><br />If it's not getting a signal for awhile it seems to turn off and start hissing. Once you start sound again(unpause a show) it takes a second to come on so you miss that bit of the show sound.<br /><br />Interference: They do hiss unless you have the sound on your device turned up and running. They get occasional pops of hissing from unknown sources. Changing channels doesn't help. One source is the heater coming on but just turning my head can do it.<br /><br />It is a plus the batteries are AAA so can be replaced<br /><br />They are made well but sound is just not what one would hope. Good for TV but not much else. I feel generous giving it three stars."
R1PDH5LJ44HIU8,5,"After SEVERAL YEARS of daily use, we could not be more pleased with the quality of these headphones.  They work ALL the time, work extremely well, and are a real bargain at less than $70.  There is absolutely NO HISS, we regularly walk to a neighboring room with no distortion, and the charge lasts for several days of normal usage.  If you want really good headphones for all types of sound, these will meet your needs.  If you are a self-described audiophile looking for the extreme performance of studio-level headphones, as some of the reviewers appear to be, get out your wallet and pay a few hundred dollars for professional studio hard-wired headphones.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
R17X1F40FTZ1IM,5,This is the third set I've purchased for my parents TVs. They are using all 3 on different TV's and are experiencing no interference. It makes watching television a pleasant experience for them as they can each clearly hear what's being said without having the volumes up too high. Would highly recommend these headphones.
RBWULQNUSWQ0T,4,I have had these for 2 years and they still work great. The one con is that you can't move your head much (especially down) or they will slide off your head.
RJGLGMVEBZPNB,3,Good sound and distance from cradle. There is a Hisss that can be heard but when music is playing it is not that  noticeable.
R14BKEI0YO5AU8,1,"Not a good product. Difficult to keep tuned to the television, and the batteries would not stay in place. I would not purchase this product again."
RGB1QKVSSOQWT,5,"I really like these new headphones.  I had two sets that we have been using for about 6 years, and the foam ear pieces are beginning to wear. Also I have to recharge the batteries pretty often--they just abruptly fizzle out in the middle of a program, which is why I use 2 sets.  Because of my hearing loss, I need the TV volume up pretty loud.  My family appreciates my using the headphones so the volume isn't too loud.  And I can watch TV from another room and still hear the program just fine.  The new earphones recharge every time I am finished using them, so they stay charged and don't cause an interruption in the middle of a program.  I can plug the base into more than just the TV, too."
RB4AP368A4SEZ,4,"I've wanted television headphones for ages now, because I'm sensitive to noise, both from indoors and outdoors. I probably drove my husband batty, telling him to turn down his TV. Now I don't have to, because he uses these headphones when he's watching TV or playing video games, and I use them when watching television and want to drown out the neighbor's dog barking and other noises.<br /><br />They were a breeze to set up and the sound is amazing. I've walked through my entire house with them and the sound never went out once. There is a slight hissing noise, but it doesn't take away from my listening experience at all."
RIC1FRNMT7HKR,3,"The manufacturing quality of the system is very good, the charging works as promised and they are a fine looking headset.  The ear pieces feel very nice and the headband is nicely padded so they feel great when first putting them on.  However, after wearing for more than an hour or two they begin to become uncomfortable...so they bring happiness twice, once when putting them on and then again when taking them off.  After selecting the best of the three channels they require 'fine-tune' adjust which came as a bit of a surprise and is becoming more and more annoying as time goes on.  It would have been nice if they put the channel fine adjust somewhere other than right next to the volume since it is easily bumped when adjusting the volume; or would be even better if they used an off-on-volume dial on one ear piece and the channel adjust on the other ear.  I rarely use the on-off switch since they turn off when putting onto the charger. The sound quality is OK for listening to the TV, but i think would be disappointing if being used for hi-fi listening.  At first i wish they had come with a 1/8\\"" stereo connector rather than RCA plugs, but i have come to prefer the RCA since (after getting splitters) i have them connected directly into the back of the TiVO rather than in the headphone jack of the TV which would have cut out the TV volume when the headphone was used...this way i can just mute the TV and not have to plug/unplug the headset.  Besides, all the connections are in the back now.  They did come with adapters for both the 1/8\\"" stereo to RCA as well as the 1/4\\"" to 1/8\\"" stereo, so that was a nice touch and an effort to try to please everyone.  Overall, i am not sure i would buy them again but i am not dissatisfied."
R2SEY3EEJSHH3V,1,The directions for this product leave MUCH to be desired!  I have had it for about a month and can not figure out how to get it to actually work.  Wish I had never bought it.
R26ION25GIV90B,5,"I bought these wireless headphones after the ones my wife got me for Christmas died.  I am impressed with the quality for the price.  I know you could spend alot more for a better pair if you are into gaming or high-quality music, but for listening to the TV these are great for the price.  Setup was easy, just plug it in and it's ready to go."
R1DY3WHP2ZIHSV,1,"I go the these headphones today and they have been great, up until I took them off. I realized that I can hear my music very well when they are on my desk. I asked my coworker who is about 10 feet away if he could hear the music when they are on my head and the response was \\""Yeah but it's not that load\\"". The problem is I have not even turned my music up that much. After doing some simple test I have found that my $20 wired headphones are much better at concealing the sound then these are.  To conclude, I would suggest looking into a different headphone if you are looking to listen to music at a decent to high volume and you don't want other people hearing everything your listening to. These are basically speakers that you can wear. If you want everyone around you to hear your music, these are the headphones for you.  These are low volume only headphones if you are going to be around anyone that doesn't want to listen to your music.  Update: I am in the process of selling/returning these since they are worthless if you are in a room for other people. Also the auto volume controller dictates the volume that you can listen to music to. I also lowered my review because using them for a few more hours just made me hate them more.  I WILL NEVER BUY SENNHEISER HEADPHONES AGAIN!"
RJZ3KMUPORC5R,5,"No problems, no hum, comfortable. Attached to audio out on satelite box and voila, good volume control on ear. Only complaint was that Amazon recommended pairing it with optical audio cable,for $9.99.  Except, headphones cannot use an optical cable, only the built in analog plugs."
R3UIPV8YSH6O3U,3,While the headphones have great range they aren't as comfortable as the other Sennheiser headphones I've worn and sometimes I can hear static. Also if you do a lot(more than walking around and such) of moving around be prepared to have them slip off.
R2UQAJH5LNNSFZ,4,I purchased these to hear TV at night while others were sleeping in my home. First pair had shorted out and returned them to sender(store).They sent another and they are working good. Helps the household !
R36FSLT0JM0VES,4,"Does everything I want, Good clear reception, Recharging is automatic and easy. On the down side they are slightly uncomfortable on the ears, and tent to want to fall off if you tilt your head forward."
R12425FP3WHLO2,4,"This set of headphones works just as described. I cinnected it to the TV music station and I can walk all around the house, basement, garage with doors closed listening to good music. Easy to install, volume control is a must and it works great, on/off switch included. Only drawback they don`t hug the ears enough to keep from sliding off. Other than that I recommend these headphones."
RM2KTIGEUOFG1,1,"Unfortunately this item did not work out for us.  I was hoping that we would be able to use the headset with our TV so that we could turn down the volumn to save my hearing!  All we got was static! My boyfried uses headset at the movies all of the time now and loves it.  I thought it would be the perfect solution to our problems at home.  To our disappointment, that is not the case at all."
R2DFOGJ677EAR9,5,We were extremely pleased with this product.  It was better than we expected.  We love the sound and my husband can hear the television so much better.
R2R6EYQHQJ0758,4,"Other than the fit of these wireless headphones, I am very pleased. They are comfortable but not adjustable for head size and when I lean over, they slip off my head unless I position them to the back of my head. I like the ability to use replaceable batteries, either alkaline or rechargeable AA. I would recommend these headphones as a good choice for most adults"
R3H4JJREVLN5G9,4,"Great headphones for my needs.  I did my research on this item and the Sennheiser's were the best for the price for hearing my Sony TV.  Sound quality is great even though, for example, if you lay them down or pause your TV, after a short while, the headphones return to a 'static' state which would disturb some people, but not me.  They are good headphones and I recommend them."
RG0ADBN7O9BOJ,1,"i saw 2000 reviews and a rating on nearly 5 - so ignored all the one star reviews - got this plugged on after a hassle and after listening for just 5 minutes decided to return - i just finished packing the item and am writing this review  Pros:  -----------  1. looks nice with a wall mount  Cons:  ----------------  0. Too PRICEY for what it has to offer  1. The power plug to the transmitter is in such a narrow place that u need to struggle to plug it in - not a huge deal - did that  2. connected it to my Desktop output - the manual says, the green light has to come up as soon as you connect the power - did not happen - after doing a permutation and combination of steps - checking my desktop output, the power cable - securing all cords - nothing happened- also tried to charge the headset with the batteries - no green light. If u get stuck in this, try to keep the transmitter on a flat surface and make sure to do all this and by luck you will see the green light - phew - finally the green light  3. started listening to a song - huge hiss noise - common until we tune (that's what i thought) - did all types of tuning - reduce computer volume, reduce head set volume, use the \\""tune\\"" on the headset, used different channels - tried to move it away from my desktop and any other nearby electronic device - same result - loud crackling sounds - hiss in between - music interruption  4. OK next tried to check the range - went to the kitchen with the transmitter in the living room - started to hear huge crackling sounds - its true whatt one reviewer said - u might loose your hearing if u don't keep the sound low  5. Headphones are not ergonomically designed - they do not cover the ear - no noise reduction from the outside (if u r a gamer forget it)  6. Headphones keep falling down even if a move just a bit  7. Sound quality is terrible - my old Microsoft Life-chat corded headphone sounds much much better - i think i am going to stick with it  8. Bad user manual - i typically don'tlook at manuals - but this one i had to - there are many things missing - like what does the small switch named channel does  My biggest complaint is the cost - i don't expect the headphone to rival \\""Bose headphones\\"" - but for 67.64$ at least give out good sound with no static ? is that too much to expect for 67 bucks? - if these were around 25 to 30 then it would do some justice  i didn't read the reviews and now i have to pay for the re-stocking fee and return shipping - what a waste - totally my fault  if you are looking for even an average wireless headphone, i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this one  Save yourself the trouble, try it out first in a shopping center or if ur friend has one before buying"
R1QEREHT6M435Z,5,We are very pleased with these headphones.  We can go up stairs or out into the yard and it sounds perfect.  I can't believe how great these are for the price.
R2ERRPHKYW3EDN,2,"Product is subpar in terms of sound engineering. Constantly spatters noises, tz - tz when switching TV from channel to channel or just turn head, and to top it all, I feel it's my fault because the model offers a spinning wheel to tune the headphones. Who the heck tunes headphones talking to own base. is it cb station? If you dare to miss with this little wheel just one tiny turn of the teeth off of what the magician sitting inside this device approved as correct position, lo and behold, the sound appears in the right headphone only. The sound is mostly of good quality, but nobody would blame you if you feel deaf on the left ear. Returning this item the day I got it. Giving it 2 stars because it still a useable product. One has to keep in mind, loud bangs produced by electric discharge in low quality audio devices is a health hazard. People working in environments with this kind of noises wear earplugs full time."
R2K09WWMDDJBSP,5,"Will order Sennheiser products again.  The sound quality is good with very little background buzzing noise.  The headset fits comfortably.  The charging station holds the headset and recharges the batteries in the set.  We had purchased a Sony and took it back because of the background buzzing.  Use the headset to mute sound on TV. Good value, good price."
R31NF8SABTG626,5,Great product for the price.  I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  I would buy a similar producat again from Amazon without any reservations!
RPPH1ECK85GFD,5,"I purchased these for listening to TV while others in the house are sleeping. The headphones are light, comfortable and easy to set up. The unit has standard red and white audio plugs attached and two different sized single pin adapters. A simple process to tune the reception resulted in a very clear and enjoyable listening experience. The soft earpads are a little warm after an hour or so but not a problem. Signal stays clear when walking around the house. Charger/cradle is easy to use. Overall impression is that this is a high quality unit."
RENXYBP5FYKRS,4,"The sound quality on these is fantastic & it sounds like I'm in the theater when watching movies. As long as I sit very still, the headphones are fine; but if I turn my head or lean forward, they slip right off my head. I've come to the conclusion that they were designed for a man... or a woman with big hair. I'm an average-sized 55 y/o woman and these are totally too big. But they keep my husband happy since he can now lower the tv volume to a more humane level. I also appreciate being able to leave the room & still being able to hear the tv (holding the headphones securely to my head, of course).  Overall, I love the sound quality, the small footprint of the base & the fact that it serves as a charger/storage stand. The sudden, loud hissing sound when the signal is dropped still makes me jump right out of my skin. The volume control dial is just above the tuning dial & this is a bad design flaw. Fortunately I can rewind live tv & catch what I just missed when trying to turn up the volume with the wrong dial. I'm thinking about securing the headphones to my head with a headband or a hat. Maybe Sennheiser could make these in a smaller size or make the width adjustable rather than just the length of the side pieces. Anyway, I've had these for about 6 months and am very pleased... except for the slipping off my head part. For that reason, I'm looking for something more my size with the same great sound. P.S. Come to think of it, I've noticed my husband keeping them on his head with a watch cap - so it's not just me."
RB05JUHNXC6JH,5,"Great product! I read the reviews here and its worth EVERY Penny. I does have a slight humming sound to it if the source audio level is not turned up..I only noticed this when its absolutely quite however. Overall, I love this product. It should be noted that it comes with two AAA rechargeable batteries and it automatically charges while it sits on its stand! Great Idea!"
RBOSINFEFR818,5,"These headphones are everything the 5-star ratings say they are - crisp and clear and every bit a match for the visual quality of HD TV.  There is one snag - they must have an analog signal.  So if you are planning to use them with a recent LCD or LED TV, check the TV for the type of \\""Audio Out\\"" signal it can provide.  If \\""Digital Out\\"" is your only choice, then, in addition to the headphones, you will need an optical cable and a digital-to-analog converter.  I ordered a \\""3 FT Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable\\"" and a \\""FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC\\"" from Amazon (The FiiO needs its own 120V outlet for power.).  After connecting the DAC to the headphone charger, and charging the headphones, everything worked great."
RULLPJ7JOIZ0Q,5,"Have thoroughly enjoyed these headphones since receiving them. The sound quality is great, they are comfortable for long periods of time, and they are easy to charge. The initial hookup was simple and I was up and running in minutes. The range is also very good as I have walked around the house listening to the TV without any interference or static.  No hissing or backdrop noise when the volume is turned down on the HEADPHONES and up on the TV. They look kind of goofy on me and other family members but it's fine for just wearing around the house. Would recommend this product."
RGSO5AXKVW4H6,4,Head phones work well although setup instuctions were a bit confusing. We are pleased with their performance. My wife and I use them while on the treadmill.
RTIN23AWCQD2U,4,"sound quality is good, distance i get reception is pretty solid too...probably about 50 ft w/o any static noise...can get up to about 100ft away and through walls and such and still hear music with a little bit of static.  for the price, i don't think you could get a better set of wireless headphones, however, if you want perfect sound without the occasional bit of static or rough patch i think you have to move to bluetooth.  i work in a lab setting so im away from my computer most of the day and in and out of different equipment rooms, and i get good reception within a reasonable distance everywhere i go"
R2PSQIN65DYZWJ,5,"These headphones have good sound quality, can get reasonably loud, and go through 2 floors of my house without any signal loss that I notice. The charging system is very convenient, you don't have to plug or unplug anything, just set them down. The problem I had was that the ear cushions are flat, which pressed my ears down onto my glasses enough to hurt after 20-30 minutes. My solution was to order a set of cushions for the RS 140 headphones from Sennheiser, which are the usual type with recesses in the center. Simply take the original cushions off the bases and glue the new ones on, problem solved, much more comfortable."
R3MZUUHCNXW16V,2,"RS130 quit working at 2 years and 2 months on a 2 year warranty. No help from Sennheiser for several reasons; 2months out of warranty, the RS130 was discontinued, and there are no replacements. While it worked I enjoyed watching TV in peace, hence 2 stars. The lack of service and inability to offer a replacement requires me not to recommend this product or Sennheiser."
R3QABYLVG809IX,4,"Perfectly adequate for watching TV or listening to the radio without disturbing your spouse.  Not for hi-fi buffs, but the price is not hi-fi either.  A very good compromise of price and performance."
R1BA8YN8HRJ9O0,5,"These headphones work very well.  The audio quality is excellent, the range is very good, and the controls are easy to use, once you get used to them.  The only drawback is that since my TV doesn't have an audio output plug I have to split the audio signals coming out of my VCR/DVD player for an input to the transmitter.  This requires the VCR/DVD player to be on when the headphones are in use."
R3SLWLFQNADNBP,5,"My husband hates the TV noise at 1230 in the morning but I'm wide awake trying to get to sleep.  I first started with the TV Ears sold on TV and they were ok, but uncomfortable (not to mention the range was very limited).  With the Sennheiser phones, I'm happy, hubby is happy and if I get up to go get a glass of water I still get the sound so I don't miss much. Thank YOU!"
RAYWZ06CWQQT4,2,"I was looking forward to having wireless headphones while going about my daily chores around the house in the garden and on casual walks.  I find that while they are comfortable, they don't stay on my head.  When I bend down they fall forward, I am constantly adjusting them, more troublesome than the wires that I was trying to avoid.  The quality of the sound when it is tuned properly is good however as you move around there are frequent blasts of static that are totally unacceptable.  I guess it would be ok if you put them on and sat in a chair and didn't move.  I didn't have that in mind when I bought them, I could do that with my earbuds."
R3S44TN72E83XR,2,This item is an outdated piece of dog poop you have to zone in on the tuning for the radio speaker and every time you move you get static it is an outdated piece of technology which doesn't deserve to be on the market today.
R3S9KS2ARGI9TS,5,"The product arrived on time via USPS ground with fed-ex tracking. The cell phone text notification of delivery worked perfectly and I will certainly use it again. I found the set up directions easy to read and apply. I hooked the headphones up to my 42\\"" Visio in no time and they worked perfectly. The only \\""hissing\\"" I encountered was eliminated once I tuned them in using the dial on the right earphone. The sound quality is excellent. I watched \\""The Dark Night\\"" on Blu-ray with the phones on and the clarity was incredible. I would have to attribute negative reviews on performance to user error. This is a good purchase and I am very satisfied with the performance of the product.<br /><br />UPDATE January 2014:<br /><br />Still working as well as the day the product arrived at my house. The sound is fantastic and I can have the volume up as high as I need. No more complaints from others about the TV being TOO LOUD! Others have worn them once and loved them. Said they can pick up sounds in movies they've never heard before right down to the smallest pebbles grinding under a character's foot when they walk. Excellent product for the hearing enhanced, not just the hearing impaired!"
R232RIUO2QTZB9,4,"The freedom from wires are a real plus for this set.  The sound quality is amazing for a unit at this price.  Battery life is several hours, and the unit works for at least 30 feet from the emiter."
RGDH0HE107PNE,4,"When I first set out to buy a set of wireless headphones for my viewing pleasure, I wasn't concerned with such notions as crystal clarity, purity of sound, or the complete absence of background white noise.  Neither was Sennheiser when they engineered this particular product.  But they have concerned themselves with providing a low cost solution for viewers wanting to turn on their television without having spouses and other family members screaming at them to turn down that racket while they busy themselves with such noiseless activities as banging together pots and pans, orchestrating impromptu choirs in your kitchen, or detonating small explosives in the family room.  For the price, I feel the quality is fair. If you are concerned with top rate quality of sound without the tedium of constantly adjusting the tuning frequency to just the right notch, you might want to give these a pass."
R2DS86LI94C1OC,1,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 with charging cradle, for my daughter for Christmas, based on the numerous 4 star reviews.  She had problems with it from the start, but didn't want to send it back because it was a gift.  She read many of the reviews, trying to figure out why the set wasn't working well. She turned the volume on the TV to max. and only used the volume on the headset.  That took care of the constant hiss. What she has not been able to correct is the fact that the sound cuts out approximately every three minutes with a loud popping/static sound.  It only lasts a few seconds, but is very annoying, and some of the conversation is lost. Also, the sound does not stay at a stable level. She has switched the channels, and moved the cradle away from the TV hoping to eliminate any interference, but to no avail.  At present, the headset is not being used.  If anyone has any suggestions, they will be appreciated.  One good thing is the sound quality, when the set is working correctly."
RCSHMZZQ43GV9,4,"This wireless headset is far better than the overpriced poor quality TV ears I had been using for about 2 years. Excellant audio quality for watching HD TV and DVD's. Audio geeks will find fault I am sure, but for the average listener this is a good buy. Ear pads are a little funky, could have a better fit."
R15TIAMNJS890K,4,"I was a little disappointed by the whirring and hissing sounds akin to tuning an analog AM radio, but I found that those sounds weren't too distracting once I got used to them.  The range was pretty good and I got used to pushing the head band back on my head when I bent over so the headphones would fall off.<br /><br />Then, about a month after my purchase, I started getting a clicking/pulsing sound that is so loud and distracting that I can't use them anymore.  I tried tuning them to different channels and turning on and off different appliances in the house, but the sound won't go away.  Not finding any solutions online, I'm going to try to return them.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I was ready to print off shipping info to ship these back when the horrid clicking/pulsing sound has left and it hasn't returned even after several months.  They are perfect for watching \\""loud\\"" television like football games in a quiet room (eg: a baby having his last meal before bed) or for listening to the television when I need to be in other parts of the house.  I've split the headphone audio output of my television with one route to a set of computer speakers and the other to the headphones so that others can listen at their preferred volume and I can listen at mine.<br /><br />The headphones still slip off if you tilt your head too far forward, but I've configured a back-of-the-head strap out of household materials to prevent this."
R2VHLZAXHD5NSM,5,"These headphones are a great buy. No cutting out, excellent quality sound and long range. The price was unbelievable for the quality of the product. Definitely recommend these to anyone."
R1XA7LUT4A35HI,5,"Works flawlessly, I'm using them right now 20ft from the base unit. Sound is decent and you really notice the surround. Perfect if you need to keep a quite house. Only negative is the headphones are a bit bulky but who cares."
R3GHDBDN02GLHO,2,I bought these headphones to watch TV. The sound is just OK they are loose fitting no matter how much I try to adjust them and get real hot after they on on for a while. Overall I would not buy them again.
R17VTE6P8IESOE,4,"I am extremely happy with this product.  A friend bought one for his wife as Christmas gift and both recommended it.  It is everything it is advertized to be.  I am very hard of hearing, even with expensive hearing aids I could not really understand video dialog.  The RS120 Wireless is the answer.  Difference between night and day."
R3JT3HGO9HN8IQ,4,"I bought these after reading these reviews. My purpose is to augment my reduced hearing acuity.  The speakers of my 60\\"" Samsung are in the back and the sound is fine for my wife but \\""muffled\\"" for me.  This headset does the trick.  The volume is set on the TV comfortable for my wife and on my headset comfortable for me.  This has been particularly helpful watching soccer games from the UK and Spain where the commentators' accents are sometimes difficult to understand.  As a minor negative, I too, believe they should have separated the tuning device from the volume contol by a little more distance to avoid moving the wrong one. The headset is comfortable and the set-up was straight forward. I did not need to adjust anything on the TV set itself."
R14V3N4JLR07FY,4,"These headphones are far superior to other brands we have tried.  You can move about the house, and even step outside with no interruption to the sound.  My husband can now listen to his shows while the rest of the house is quiet.  Great for those sleepless nights."
R1OTCRN729F04D,5,"Very easy to install, great sound.  Now I can watch a late night TV show without disturbing anyone.  Also my son can watch his cartoons in the family room and I can carry on a conversation with my  wife.  Isn't that a plus?"
R2DL8VKIFQW39U,1,I purchased this item recently and returned it because it was defective.  I sent back the item and received a new one: it too was defective and I returned it.  Neither unit turned on.
RMBQN6LJXG5QS,4,Very pleased with the product.  Good value and quality.  I am especially pleased with the fact that it came with rechargeable batteries that charge while the headphones are on the stand.
RGS4ZF9E0W4FA,4,"Like many others, I bought these headphones to help with my declining ability to hear the TV at normal levels.  I feared I'd be unable to balance the low volume my husband likes through the loudspeakers connected to the TV with what I need through the headphones.  I connected them to the headphone jack on the front of my stereo receiver, switched them on and tuned to the TV. It works great.  My husband keeps the remote to adjust as needed and I use the volume control on the headphones.  Now, I can relax and watch the show rather than straining to understand the dialog. Since I'm connected to an FM receiver I've also been listening to radio shows from anywhere in the house without disturbing my husband. It's all more than I expected."
RP3TAQ62NVC8I,5,Great product.  My whole family enjoys using them.  Would and have recommended to friends.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]
RK6KXTBMO89UT,5,"They are  excellent - have good fidelity ,are comfortable to wear & attractive . In addition  they have , very importantly ,  a rugged construction . The price is very reasonable compared to others . As an engineer I can't imagine how the design could be improved upon ."
R8UGL4EF9WDOL,5,Excellent product!! Great range - clear sound anywhere in house.  Great for hearing my favorite news program (O'Reilly) while walking on treadmill. Great for wife watching TV without preventing me from going to sleep.  Great for grandson watching NickJr favorites while rest of family maintains some degree of sanity.  Highly Recommend!
R36CMWHS2C89F1,5,"These are absolutely the best headphones (not just the best cordless headphones) I have ever used. Everything about them is great, so I'll just mention a couple of specially favorite features:  * The \\""coat hanger\\"" on the base unit looks a little odd but you'll find that you can drop the headphones onto it and start them recharging. There is no need to place them carefully or jiggle them around to make an electrical contact for charging, as most other products require.  * The three position channel selector on the base/transmitter is great, allowing you to find the best, interference-free signal, but better still is the fine-tuning control on the headphones themselves (that's in addition the volume control). If, while listening, you wander into an area of the building where the signal drops, loses quality, or picks up interference, you can use this fine-tuning control to bring back the best quality listening, often without needing to adjust the volume control.  My only (very small) criticism is that the headphones seem to be made for someone with a somewhat larger head than mine. I think I'm a fairly typical adult male, and yet I need to wear these headphones with the headband adjusted to the smallest, tightest setting. Even so, when tilting my head forward and downward its necessary to grasp the headphones to prevent them falling off. In most circumstances, the headphones fit very comfortably, and a little care when moving around is a small price for the brilliant audio quality, but for children or smaller-headed adults, this could be a problem."
RQ815T12DY9QD,5,"I brought these headphones as a gift for my husband.  The quality is perfect and I'm now able to get a peaceful night sleep because I don't have to hear the television.  The headset is also very comfortable, so comfortable that he frequently falls asleep with them on."
R3ED3ADA6DFC4G,5,"Good sound quality, we have used these for several hours on a single charge. overall we are very satisfied with our purchase."
RGHIHP1IJ8Y4G,5,"Silence is golden!  My husbands hearing loss was driving us all deaf, he had the television so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think and now we are all at peace.  He is the happiest.  The headphones are clear and static free.  He wears them for hours and says they are very comfortable.  And easy, we had them connected and usable in seconds.  The BEST Investment we have ever made!"
R2KL4WHC2GYYB6,5,I am on my second pair because I can't keep them on my head when I bend over and they fall off my head and hit the tile floor.  However they work great.  Love them or I wouldn't have ordered the second pair if they didn't.
R2H88WDTFN9I3P,2,"Background:  I have had a set of Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo Headphones for about a year now.  I wanted to get another set for my wife, and being the research nerd that I am, I found these Sennheiser's reviewed higher the the Sony, so I gave it shot.  Big let down!  Pros:  - the only thing that could be considered good (depending on your perspective) about these vs the sony is the manual on/off switch.  The Sony has a very well engineered auto switch that comes on every time the headphones are on your head.  There is a very sensitive elastic band built into the head piece that senses even the slightest amount of pressure.  In the most awkward of positions if they are being pushed off your head because you are laying on a pillow or something, they can sometimes turn off and you have to re-adjust them.  But 99% of the time it's a non issue and very convenient to have them automatically turn on and off.  With these Sennheiser's you can turn them on with the switch manually - just don't forget to turn them off and run the battery dead!  Something you don't need to worry about with the sony.  Cons:  - WAAAAY less comfortable than the sony!  The sony ear pieces are so much softer and more plush!  No contest!  These feel like hard cheap vinyl instead of soft plush material like the sony.  - you have to \\""tune\\"" them with a dial, otherwise you will hear static.  Maybe this comes in useful under extreme distances (which is not something I use it for).  For the majority of situations this unnecessary and just one more thing to have to adjust.  The sony just automatically tunes it's self (just fine).  - Charging sucks compared to the sony!  The sony has a nice little groove that \\""locks\\"" the headphones in place.  Just drop them in the cradle.  They charge like apple computers with no physical connection.  This Sennheiser has to be \\""aligned\\"" on 2 metal rods and you need to make sure it is getting good metal/metal contact.  It's totally jenky after getting used to the sony.  Iliterally couldn't believe it when I first went to charge them.  Overall these are not even in the same league as the sony??  WTF?  Amazon reviewers duped me and I procrastinated beyond my 30 day return window :("
R2XOTL5C46D8NW,4,Needed to replace some old Radio Shack headphones that finally went bad. I had some Sennheiser ear buds that I bought sometime ago and really liked them. So I looked to Sennheiser for the replacement headphones. Bought these and right from the beginning I was satisfied with them. They are much better then my old cheap headphones. They automatically charge when not in use. I am very satisfied with these headphones. Gave them 4 stars cause I have only owned them for 6 months.
R1L97JZJ9T5EU3,5,These headsets are clear and very comfortable.  I can wear them next to my spouse and he doesn't hear a note from the headsets!!  I love them. I highly recommend them and would buy them again if something happened to these!
RLM1RW6HU7LTX,5,The Sennheiser headphones met all my expectations.  They are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is excellent.  I can finally hear every word spoken on TV without the TV volume blaring.
R3RA5EQPE7E1ZN,4,I found this item to be as described. Works great!! Able  to walk around the complete house and still receive great reception.  Very good product for the money. Yes they are a little loose when bending over but I find that to be a minor issue.
R3AN6PJT8Z0I7K,2,"DON'T BUY THESE! The connection is so catchy! I feel like I can never catch a break with these headphones. One minute I'll be listening fine and the next the connection goes out and the green light goes out too. I didn't change anything and these would just stop working!!! I didn't use them for like a week once, and the green light stayed on (meaning they had connection to my TV) and when I went to use them again the green light went off. Spend a little more and buy a better pair, you won't regret it. Sending these back asap."
R2LUB4XA4CN3VJ,5,"I think these are great, exactly what I needed. My hearing is not great, so I would turn up my tv or music so loud that it would be heard by the other family members in other rooms. With these, I can listen as loud as I want without bothering the rest of the household.  Sound quality is fine for me. I can even walk out in the yard with them. I get small popping sounds as the signal gets weak, but I'm a long way from the base unit by then. I can sit on the back porch and listen to music with no problems at all."
R1OYENS7FXDZXC,5,I gave these as a Christmas gift and they work perfectly!  We can have the television turned up just a little and I can hear perfectly fine and so can everyone else.
RPPNDUQO3EP6P,5,"Very easy to set up, sound great. Could fit a bit more snugly.Outher wise I am very pleased with this product."
R2411IBL9QJJSN,2,"The FM hiss in these headphones is the biggest deal breaker for me in these cans.  I couldn't adapt to it.  Tried every trick suggested in the comments and while you can get it pretty low, if you raise the volume over normal speaking level, they hiss.  The audio quality in these headphones is also pretty substandard.  Bass is nonexistent, listening to classic rock and prog rock mostly, and the trebles are muddy.  I have a pair of old Sony over ears that cost me $50 years ago and they make these feel like iPod ear buds.  These headphones are also not meant for watching television while someone else in the room tries to sleep.  The opened backs of the phones bleed substantially.  These are the first wireless headphones I have ever purchased and may be the last.  The only major pro to these headphones is that they have a substantial range.  Can roam around my yard and not experience any loss on my postage stamp suburban lawn."
R1LETT8RDW5GUJ,5,"I purchsed these headphones to replace a different set I bought from Radio Shack years ago.  The Radio Shack unit finally died after many years of good service (I thought).<br />This unit cost me about 1/2 the price and works even better!<br />New technology I guess. These headphones have about twice the range, are eaiser to use, and sound better.<br />I do not have any knowledge of other brands but I am very happy with these."
R2N9MPOU6FKNHX,5,"My house has a loft at the top of it. It is my dughter's bedroom, unfortunatelly, the volume of the TV travels very clearly up to it.  It has been a blessing to have the headphones because she does not longer complains about the \\""loud volume\\""  Also, when I watch movies from netflix, somewhat, the volume is very low and I have to raise it in order for me to listen clearly.  Now with my hearphones, I can watch movies at night.  They are comfortable, light weithg and can be out of sight very easily.  My daughter likes them too because she does not have to complaint any longer."
R16I13YVXGO5SN,5,"I bought my first pair of Sennheiser cordless headphones about 3 years ago, as a gift for my husband.  I quickly began to borrow them more and more frequently until it got to the point we needed to buy a second pair.  We use these on our computer, laptop, TV or stereo.  They're fabulous if you're working outside, or working in the kitchen and want to hear your audio above the sound of running water, stove vent or sizzling stir fry.  I watch last-night's TV online while I buzz about the house doing laundry, floors and all sorts of chores. Also great when you want to watch a movie with your kids nearby but don't want them to hear the language. You can easily operate multiple pairs of headphones-- either tune them all to the same frequency so you can share the experience, or tune them separately so you can each enjoy your entertainment separately.  Best piece of technology we own!"
R1FXRFIMXGPRJV,5,"Decided to try a wireless solution for a hearing impaired father-in-law.  The TV is turned on so loud in his bedroom, I get a headache whenever I visit (and I don't even hang around his bedroom).  He smiled as soon as I set it up for him and put on his head.  It's not audiophile quality, but pretty good, and with the rechargable battery system, easy to use and I don't have to worry about running there every few days to pop in new batteries for him.  Everyone wins and it's reasonably priced."
R321WBRODLZOM,1,I TRIED AND TRIED AND TIRED TO US THIS WITHOUT EXTREME STATIC AND LOW RECEPTION. IT DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRANSMITTER.  PURE JUNK
R1VBHZBNM85W7V,5,"I've had these headphones for six days now, and I think they're great for watching TV. There were no surprises during installation. The rechargeable batteries already contained a charge, and I was able to test them right away. Once fully charged, these batteries can go on for days without recharging; depending on how many hours you use the headphones. These headphones drown out any surrounding noise, but I can still hear important sounds, such as the ringtone on my cell phone. However, no more annoying neighbor sounds! While tuning the headphones, I discovered I could receive HAM radio operators going on and on with their bro-mances. I give these headphones a five for the price. Don't get these if you require noise cancellation."
R1E6DD87AP9TIC,5,"Only a few bucks more, and the Sennheiser is miles ahead of all cheaper and many more expensive headphones.  Superior quality & performance.  Also, get the cradle auto-recharge headphones.  Really cool feature.  It's refreshing to find a product that does better than it says it will."
R31831II06VBJ0,5,Wow!  Is this a great product for folks with less than excellent hearing.  It is easy to hook-up to a television or amplifier.  The headphones are comfortable though somewhat warm.  I have TV Ears and I prefer this product.  I give a high recommendation for the Sennheiser Headphones.
RRDJ9CA4TM46P,5,"Got these for Christmas because my wife is tired of my blowing out the windows due to my hearing loss.  I had given up watching TV because I couldn't hear or understand the soundtrack.  Tried an RCA set and took them back.  The sennheiser's are beyond belief.  I can hear every little sound. I can go anywhere inside the house and quite a way across the yard and still here clearly. I haven't experienced sound like this in years. The stereo separation of this headset is almost like surround sound. Not quiet, but close enough for me. No distortion, no hiss.  Even the quiet moments in a movie are enjoyable.  I have an extensive collection of movies that I had to watch when I was home alone.  Even then it wasn't enjoyable because I couldn't make out the background sounds and conversation that adds so much to a movie.  I am currently working my way back through my favorites and enjoying them as much as and maybe more than before my hearing loss.  All I can say is...thanks sennheiser for not only a great headset but a headset this good at an affordable price."
R2VFRMKEHXAH3D,5,These Sennheiser wireless headphones have turned out to be absolutely superb.  I heartily recommend them to anyone.  I use them on my television and gave them their initial tryout using a very poor soundtrack from an early 1930s Laurel and Hardy movie and they handled it very well.  They went on to prove their worth in a modern movie with an excellent soundtrack.  Worth the money!  Don
R2FUY94SFKTW1A,5,"Bought a set because the wife didn't like to hear the XBox games.  Found that not only did it help keep the \\""peace\\"" (primary objective), but also found that I was hearing things I don't normally pick up from the TV.  Short of expensive surround-sound (and back to my original problem), I found this to be an exceptional product that provided clarity and depth I hadn't expected.<br /><br />I haven't had any experience with the hiss reported by others under normal use - unless the transmitter is significantly blocked from line-of-site or the frequency adjustment is out of synch.  Even then, it is nominal - as I even occassionally wear them while cutting the grass and still hear quite well but do pick up a little hiss then.<br /><br />I took them over on a visit to my parents for my Father to try - he has hearing loss and is constantly turning up the TV to hear - causing my Mother grief (maybe this is hereditary?)  Anyhow, he loved them and bought his own set.  He's now shown other people who now want their own and I actually came back to this page in order to forward the link on - and took the time to leave a comment."
R27JW669HW0C08,4,"I received my head phones finally after rather slow shipping.  I am very happy with the product.  Only criticism is the fact that if you move around or try to do anything where you move your head very much, they fall off all too easy.  The sound is great."
R3U4SHHVKKLZDR,1,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, and had a problem hooking it up...the company told me I would need a cable for it...Sennheiser said cable $49 bucks..Radio Shack $29 bucks...probably could have used Amazon for better price but not all of us are electronics saavy so after the frustration of trying to get it connected...I boxed it up sent it back...I wish companies would understand about the confusion for the folks who didn't grow up with this stuff. If it's a brand new tv and brand new headphone set...why all the extras??? Why can't they make it easier......"
R83GI845491PK,5,"Bought these for my mother-in-law and she loves them.  Sound quality is very good.  They have excellent range and the re-charging cradle keeps them at full battery.  We did initially have trouble getting them to seat properly on the charging rods, but I flexed the top of the headset a little and it sits perfectly now."
R2VC8L1K2ZD11M,5,I had already purchased one set a year ago. This set was a gift for Christmas. He loves them!!! And in the future I will buy them again.
RSSAPHNMPU0VH,5,"WOW!  I took these out of the box, plugged in the transmitter, installed the batteries in the headphones and was Rockin & Rollin!  Clear sound, no hiss, works in the basement, upstairs, out on the back porch  and in the driveway.  Absolutely great sound!  I would give 10 stars if available.  Do not hesitate to buy!"
R1WRHHZA1MGPGT,5,"Awesome! Far superior to Sony, and cheaper to boot. Sound quality is superb! Comfortable, and almost totally eliminates outside noise and distraction. An excellent value. My only regret is that I had to go through two sets of Sonys to find them"
R3BQZZJUCIG742,5,"I recently purchased the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones. I have been very pleased. They have an outstanding sound quality, very clear all around my office area (psst...you can wear them to the bathroom). I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to have quality sound, reasonable price and no wires."
R33XDSIM7IV4DG,5,These headphones were recommended by a friend.  Excellent sound quality and more comfortable to wear than ear buds. We have recommended them to others.
R2KYJYJTD76D5J,5,Ordered these for my Dad who has hearing loss and has used other headphones to listen to the TV and not have the volume to loud for the rest of the house but these are the best every. He says he can hear anywhere in the house - very clear - and everyone else loves it also !
R1T5QU616VJUQM,5,"works great, if you buy direct from sennheiser it runs at $120 each. I was able to find this on amazon at half that. Works great on the 2nd floor level also. no static. I wish I knew how to connect 2 to the same tv. I'm sure theres some sort of adapter for that. if you are looking for headphones this is definatley the one to get."
R3KZUGBDABD86G,5,"I just got these headphones, and this is my initial impression<br /><br />[+] Headphones are very comfortable<br />[+] The bass is very good and volumes get very high with clear sound.<br />[+] Very easy to use, i just plugged the charger&transmitter in and voila.<br />[+] Some very nice gimmicks like: to charge the headphones you place them on the charger without any cables needed.<br />it's cool and elegant.<br /><br />Overall these headphones exceeded my expectations which were already high.<br />Good work Sennheiser."
R2PAU3SJACAXCG,5,"I am very happy my sennheiser headphones!  i highly recommend them to anybody that has difficulty hearing their TV.  The sound is very clear and i can even listen in another room without any static, hum or interference.  5 STARS!!!"
RFK4B8RSY5H0U,5,"In case you weren't convinced by the 2400 other reviews out there, these headphones are a huge upgrade from wired headphones. Maybe not in sound quality, but in practicality. I almost never used my wired headphones because they would always knock things off the coffee table and scare my dog. But with these guys, I wear them all the time because they don't do that. They even work upstairs!"
R1Q02JK5ESPY11,5,These headphones are really comfortable. The sound is unbelevable! The distance that these headphones go is remarkable. You can go outside or into the kitchen or into the bathroom and you do not miss a thing! I would recomend them to anyone.
R2VNM01A8JDTQE,2,"I purchased these for my LG LCD TV and used them for the first time last night (takes 24 hours to charge the headphone batteries). I live in an apartment in LA with thin walls and want to watch TV early or late without disturbing my neighbors.  The unit worked pretty well last night but there is a constant low hissing noise even with a good signal, and this gets louder if I move more than 5 feet away from my TV. While using them this morning, suddenly there was a loud blip of static and the transmitter base shut down. It was still plugged into the wall and receiving AC, but the green light went out and it was just loud static. I had to unplug the cord connected to the TV headphone jack and replug to reset it, then fiddle with the controls to find the signal again. Ten minutes later it happened again. Fifteen minutes after that it happened again. And then five minutes later it happened FOR THE FOURTH TIME. Totally frustrating! All I can guess is the problem is caused by a neighbor using their remote, or some other electric issue. I've just emailed Sennheiser customer support to see if they can troubleshoot this. If not, I'm sending them back to Amazon."
R2RVXWAKQYZAL,5,"After reading many positive reviews from Amazon customers about this product, we decided this was the one we wanted. We are extremely happy with them. Great quality sound.  Almost like surround sound.  Great value, also!"
R1ZWKVONTMPU0Z,4,"Sounds better than expected, no problems thus far. They do fall off if you lean over too far but fine with me since they also sit very lightly on the ears. The corded $100+ Audio-Technicas I own fall off if I lean forward too far as well, which in my opinion is better than clamping down on your head, the tight headphones give me head aches after prolonged use."
R1YG7WGXZAV3M1,3,I use this Head phone system while rowing my Row Exercise machine. Works great for that. Sound is fair. I had another older Panasonic infrared head phone set that I liked better. More comfortable better Stero sound.   Alas my wife mistakingly sold it at a Yard sale. For the price this new head phone set will suffice. If I were going to listen to a lot of stero music etc. Would upgrade.
R26192ZEV8QVP4,5,"THE RS 120 HEASSETS ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE HEARING THE TELEVISION OR UNDERSTANDING THE WORDS FULLY, THESE ARE FOR YOU.  YOUR WIFE CAN TURN THE TV AS LOW AS SHE LIKES, AND YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR VOLUME AS HIGH AS YOU LIKE AND BOTH ARE HAPPY.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRICE CONTINUALLY GOING UP.  I HAVE PERSONALLY ORDERED SEVERAL FOR FRIENDS,AND RECOMMENDER SOME OTHERS THAT ORDERED.  ALL ARE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, BUT DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRICE KEEPS GETTING HIGHER.  THANKS, JOE DAVIS"
R1OSBP5EWO9K3L,5,I did a lot of research on various wireless headphones.  These had good reviews and a good price.  They were for my husband (and me too so I would not have to listen to the television turned up).  He loves them!  The quality is excellent.
R24PODTV6PNTN0,5,"These are excellent wireless headphone and a tremendous value. I love the charging capability and the headphones can go a long time without having to be charged. I have not tested how much use I can obtain before charging them, but I will use them for a few hours and even leave them off the charging cradle for days, and maybe once per week I charge them. The sound is excellent. The ear coverings aren't the highest quality as I would expect leather or something similar for high-end headphones, but they are surprisingly comfortable and I haven't had any problems and they seem to be quite comfortable, even after a couple hours of use."
R1PBQC85KS57M8,5,I got these phones for my mom.  They're awesome!  The wireless receiver is plugged into a A/V selector so that we can change back and forth between the satellite receiver and the DVD player at the push of a button.  The range on these phones is excellent.  Can't beat 'em for the price.
R3DCLQFA3D3USZ,2,"This headset was pretty cool and worked pretty darn good... it was a little tricky to get it to sit just right and charge, but it sounded good and was comfortable.  And then after a month or so of occasional use it stopped working, and so I shipped it back to Sennheiser.  They acknowledged receipt of it, and now it's three weeks later and I haven't heard back from them.  Three weeks to repair or replace a defective part is unacceptable, in my opinion.  Update:  I emailed Sennheiser to ask about the status and they replied that they HOPE to look at my product within the NEXT TWO WEEKS!  So they'll have my defective product for at least a month!"
R3CXMCJJGWWLKF,5,"Purchased this product to watch TV late at night while everybody else is sleeping.  It is extremely simple to set up (literally just plug the power cable into the wall and the audio cable into the \\""audio out\\"" plug on the back of your TV) -- that's it.  The battery has never died on me while watching TV, provided that after each use I just place it back on the charging cradle.  The sound is great - I'm no audiophile but it sounds just as good as using my TV's speakers, if not better.  If you've ever been told to 'turn the TV down' to avoid bothering others, this product is for you!  PS: I saw they have a digital version of this for 3x the price - I have absolutely no complaints about the analog version, and don't see why you would need to pay so much more."
R3B61W7XJWH1FB,5,"This is a great wireless headphone. I originally bought the 180 model from Amazon and found it to be absolutely no better than this unit...except for its range.  The 120 has a very limited area in which it picks up sounds from its base. In my house (older home; plaster walls; well built), it begins to snap, crackle and pop 30 feet or less from its base (and my listening room). This works for me; for the MUCH better price than the 180, I can tolerate a bit less range.  Well satisfied with this unit. While others may get 100-200 feet from the base station, I can't. However, overall I highly recommend it."
R1V3GNXKZC6FFF,5,Great quality easy hook up and am able to walk to the far side of the house with no signal loss completely satisfied with purchase would buy from this seller again
R25PE1LXWKM1QI,5,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle, for my husband for christmas.  They are wonderful--clear, crisp sound and often times are clearer than the audio on the tv when not listening with headphones on, especially movies. Not too mention I tell everyone I bought the headphones for myself to let my husband use.  Easy to set-up and use!  I've recommended them to several of my friends and they've purchased them also.  Said they have saved their marriage!  I can believe it.  And after christmas they were even on sale!  Don't pass these up!"
R221WDUY5OXCO2,5,"I bought this one because it is wireless and Sennheiser brand name. I didn't expect the sound quality too much since I thought headpones can never compete with my floorspeakers which have a deep and tight bass. But the sound of this one is so good that much beyond my expectation: crisp high, sufficient bass...  Also the rechargeable batteries last a long time to use. After the 1st charging of 18 hours, it lasted three weeks...I didn't count how many hours total but I did use it daily a half to one hours."
R1RFNPFOKTZE4T,5,"Before my Sennheisers arrived , I purchased a 'cheap' headphone ( the type seen on tv ) and was not very happy - too much distortion , volume was linked to the tv volume , uncomfortable , etc . I was afraid this idea of wireless headphones was not going to work well for me . Boy , was I ever wrong . These headphones are great . Clear and dynamic . Much better sound quality than my TV . Comfortable and easy to use . The charging cradle really makes this product perfect . Rarely does A product create this much excitement in me , but Sennheiser has done it . Great job ! By-the-way , this is the first review that I have ever written ."
R2VGJ7IKZ87KKG,4,"I have to admit that these are the first RF headphones I've really used, but they do sound very good; and the range is great. The big tip I learned is to pump the volume up from the source & control the volume using the dial on the right earpiece. This will minimize static noise & maximize the sound quality. I have a small head for a guy ( I know because I wear a size S motorcycle helmet ) and the headset fits pretty good; ideally it'd be a bit tighter, but it doesn't fall off or anything. For the price, these are great. I have another set on order right now for the wife ...so we can watch, & hear, movies when the baby is sleeping :)"
RIUX3TDQXSLTS,5,"I received these headphones yesterday and they work exactly as described.  I just had to unpackage them, put in the included rechargeable batteries, plug up the cables, and let them charge.  After work I turned on the TV and adjusted the volume.  I can walk around and not miss a thing.  So far very nice product."
R28PAUN41KTZZX,5,"Easily installed---excellent sound, surprising range. Very happy with the quality of the product, far superior to similar, more expensive product purchased and returned elsewhere due to poor sound quality. Would recommend without reservation."
RE2OOHNQZKRM4,5,"My mom has never been able to find a headphone that really lets her cut through the background music on TV and in movies to hear the dialogue. These headphones let her do that. For anyone with partial hearing loss or even a bit more advanced, these are the headphones to try. My mom has almost complete hearing loss in one ear and these help her considerably. Good luck, I hope they do the same for you."
R3UFI9RS06VEGS,5,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones in 2009 to use for work. My job involves listening to and evaluating the speaking skills of students. I work from home and move around a lot in my home while I'm doing my job. So, as you can imagine, I had high demands for this product. Overall, I have found that they are durable, dependable, and offer the best range of wireless headphones like these. In fact, I just purchased a replacement pair.  PROS: Best range of any consumer wireless headphones, even at a higher price point.  CONS: Big and unsightly and can get a little uncomfortable after long-term wear (i.e. 40 hours per week). (I wish this same technology could be adapted for ear buds but I'm not sure if that's possible.)  A little about me and my headphones ... I used (and abused) these babies for 8 hours/day M-F for about 2 years. My using involved listening to audio files for work. When I wasn't working, I also used the to stream TV and audio books for pleasure, while walking around the house, doing chores, light exercise, cooking, etc. I had them serviced twice during the warranty period, which was a relatively hassle-free process. (In fact, they have an old school repair shop and you can actually talk to the repair guys on the phone.) I'm sad to say that after 2.5 years, they stopped working. I'm not entirely surprised as I'm hard on these babies and knock them around a lot. I recently purchased a replacement pair (same make/model).  My favorite aspect is the range of coverage. I have tried other models, some that those that use infrared (line of sight) technology, Bluetooth, and also headphones that claim to have a similar range (i.e. Sony's 900MHZ Analog RF Wireless Headphones and others by JVC and RadioShack). NONE of the others could even begin to compete with the range of this particular model by Sennheiser.  When using the Sennheiser RS 120's, I can walk from room to room in my 1200 square foot apartment, down 2 floors, and even a couple hundredfeet outside (to take out the garbage, etc.) with good sound. If you just wanted to watch TV, i.e. be in the same room, another type of headphones would be fine (and might work better as they'd be \\""lower profile.\\"") But if you need to move to another room, the Sennheiser RS 120 is the only model that will actually maintain audio quality through walls, in my experience."
R3KXUCT0BZ5ZHB,5,"These headphones worked perfectly out of the box. After their initial 1-day battery charge, I plugged them into the TV, turned them on, and was blown away by their quality. Great sound reproduction and lightweight. I can hear them in any room in my apartment. I can even stand out on the deck, close the door, and still hear them perfectly without any hiss. Easy to recharge becaue they just lay across the top of the charger cradle.  My only complaint: they fall forward if you tip your head down for an extended time. This didn't affect my 5-star rating, though. I just attached an eyeglasses strap (crokie) around each side. I place the strap around the back of my head, and cinch it up when I need to. Then I can cook or whatever without them falling into the frying pan. Not too ugly because my hair covers it up. Great headphones at a good price. Amazon delivered them quickly, too."
R2UGRL6SVQA8BR,5,"Like the title said, these work like a charm. I bought these to watch TV and play PS3 games while my wife is sleeping and they do an excellent job of letting me do both. I can even get up and walk downstairs and there's no change in the sound quality all that distance away. Love 'em!"
RJW8P92EE7ACL,5,I purchased the headset so my wife could get some sleep when I stayed up late. I am very happy with the sound on this device. Would purchase it again if I needed one.
R2I0978IUDIQPC,5,"I am so glad I got these!  I was worried if they would work with the treadmill!  It is like magic!  I can't believe how well these work and I am so relieved that I can exercise, hear the tv, and allow my family to sleep though it all.  A must have for anyone with a treadmill!"
R1NW073KV2PTIF,5,"I bought theses for watching tv, awesome sound, no interference problems, I tried 6 other units, Sony, RCA etc, these were actually the least interference and hiss, decent price at less than $60 and well made, no charge plugs, just sit it on top of the cradle, highly recommend."
RYMAA6MM2R2M0,5,Purchased the headphones to listen to music and watch TV. The sound is clear and easy to adjust. It is great to work at my desk and listen to music without disturbing the rest of the house. Same for watching TV. Have had the headphones for a couple of weeks and so far so good.
R3MZ6FUKUK7I5H,4,"The sound could not be better once you choose the correct channel from four choices .... no big deal.  Distant reception is better than expected.  I can keep them on and move between rooms during viewing breaks with no issues.  My only con is they are not soft on the ears.  You know, comfortable.  To wear them for an extended period of time needs breaks on the ear's skin.  Kind of like flat rough foam pushing on your ears...hey but for the price and the quality sound, they're great.  Thanks kids!!  Great present for your tech/gadget freak Dad."
R3IGQ2G20CRJ82,5,"These headphones are great. I can watch TV without disturbing people or dogs. They are lightweight and comfortable. I can still hear some of the ambient noise, which I like, such as the phone ringing. No interference from other electrical devices at all. The customer service representative who helped me select them was absolutely right."
R3OHWQWNODOBPB,4,"This is not the first set of headphones that i have owned,  however this is by far the best set that i have owned. The sound is good & the range is great. I think you will enjoy them if they are your choice."
R2HBS76MKHBSEH,2,"These were recommended by my own Brother who loves his and the price was WAY lower than the $200+ pairs that I was about to buy.  It seemed too good to be true, but when I got them home and hooked them up, VOILA!!!  They seemed fantastic!!  There was some hissing at higher volumes, but for the most part, and especially for the money, they seemed like a steal!  Two or three weeks in, I noticed that only the left or right side could be \\""tuned\\"" in.  This was exhausting as I would fiddle with the tune feature and one side would kick in, then the other, but never both together.  I thought I was having a bad day, but I tried over and over again, day after day, with the same result.  My bedroom (the only place I used them) is only 14' x 14', so distance was not the issue.  DVD or TV - one side or the other but never in stereo, VERY FRUSTRATING!!!  I gave up after three or four nights of cursing and fiddling I went ahead and bought a $150 Vizio pair (same brand as my TV). I hope to have less issues and I like the idea of having an iPod dock included.  We'll see if I get better results...  Bottom line?  You get what you pay for."
R3SM015PZU3CT1,5,these headphones are great. work very good. look good and have the best sound ever. i would tell anyone to buy these. very pleased with the product.
RNWGU0GTDM7Y2,5,"I ordered this hoping that my husband can watch tv and I can get some zzzz's. He likes to watch TV to fall asleep and I can't fall asleep with the TV on. I hooked this up and wallah! Magic, cant believe all I needed was something so simple. Works like a charm - thinking of ordering a second pair just in case something happens to this one."
RYK4R5E1P7G0F,4,"extremely satisfied with sound quality, rich bass, keeps outside noise away.The only drawback is the bulkiness of the product and unstable fit. Very reasonable price tag certainly made it easier to decide for this particular model."
R2ZP0NOEHU9D4K,3,"I've owned these headphones for over a month.<br /><br />I knew that $60-ish wasn't going to get me anything in the \\""really nice\\"" category, but based on the overwhelming number of good reviews I opted to spend an affordable (to me) amount of money for these Sennheisers.<br /><br />I based my performance expectations on the reviews.  My expectations, however, were met with some disappointment.<br /><br />The 'white noise' is incessant.<br /><br />No matter what outlet it's plugged into, no matter the placement of the transmitter - the incessant 'hissing' wears quickly on one's nerves.  The only way it's barely noticeable is when there's fairly 'busy' music playing.  You can forget about enjoying quiet passages.<br /><br />Although I'm seldom more than 8 feet from the transmitter, decent reception decays dramatically if I turn my head the \\""wrong\\"" way or recline in my chair.<br /><br />Putting in fresh (fully recharged) batteries doesn't help either.<br /><br />That said, the distance of the signal is at least the 65 feet to my mailbox.<br /><br />If all I listened to were rock or pop music, this probably wouldn't be such a negative review.  But I listen to music with quiet passages - quiet that is excepting the ever present hissssssss.<br /><br />The bass is pretty good, installation is a snap (let them charge for 24 hours), the controls aren't as bad as folks are making them out to be, and the charging couldn't be any easier.  I don't find them uncomfortable on my ears even when wearing glasses.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary but I just keep telling myself: \\""what did you expect for that amount of money?  You got what you paid for.\\""<br /><br />I regret not saving up for a higher performance product.  Lesson learned - buyer beware."
R1SGFDSFS2TD9L,2,"Setup instructions are not clear.  Unable to figure out what equipment to connect the base to.  TV, cable box, surround speakers?????????????"
RVJWBMR9Y15NR,5,"Headphones bring harmony. I can watch sports and movies at volume levels that work for me while my wife can set her own sound comfort level, maybe even mute."
R1T2YBFC7VGTNT,2,"I just received my pair today, set them up and still unable to get them to work? I have placed everything where it needs to go, checked and recheck and yet still nothing! I'll give this one more day to charge up and then if that fails I'll have to return for a refund! I'm going to be optimistic though. Amazon hasn't failed me yet."
RL4B0UTLUH3KY,4,"Overall this is just what I needed, something so that my girlfriend and I could watch TV without bothering the other if they're studying or trying to sleep. Sound is what you'd expect for the price, it's decent but the bass and treble are a little flat. Easy to charge and great battery life so far.  A side note: the headphones are literally \\""over the ear\\"" the whole ear pad is the same depth, so it doesn't \\""envelop\\"" your ears so much as rest on it, it'd prefer the former, but I've adjusted sufficiently.  Two minor things:  - I really wish there was a switch to control connectivity to the audio-in. If it's plugged into the TV, the TV will only output to the headphones, i.e. there's a lot of fumbling around the back of the TV when I want to use/stop using the headphones  - I wish the fit was a little snugger; when bending over the unit will sometimes slide off my head, and I enjoy cleaning my apartment when listening to music/watching TV  Overall, would recommend."
RZRQE8F0NM19S,5,"They're as good as, if not Better than, any theater's surround system I've heard. As for the cut-out some reviewers mentioned, yes I lose the signal after about 4-5 minutes of silence such as when they roll the credits (silently) at the end of a TV movie. But it's easy to reconnect again. My only (minor) complaint is that the volume control wheel is too recessed, and not in a location where your hand 'normally falls' when you reach for it, but I'll adjust for that in a short time. Note: The Green LED on the transmitter will stay on for a few minutes even though you've turned off the TV, because (at least with my 1990's model), they had capacitors in the circuitry that hold a charge for a while after the power is shut off to the TV set. So, if the Green LED is On (indicating that the transmitter is getting audio from the source...but then goes dark (at least, for an older TV), that's natural when a TV with capacitors is being used as the audio source, and does NOT indicate any problem."
RU0095MARBNS6,5,"Wireless headphones were new territory for me and after reading up on them I had some reservations about buying a pair for under $60.00 especially having encountered some reviews which told of hissing noises, interference, etc. I went ahead and took the plunge and went for the RS 120 based on its strong sales and the fact that there were some very positive reviews to counteract the negative ones.  So, after giving the batteries a full charge I tried them out with my TV in HD and the sound was so good it was comparable to being at the movies. I am a little hard of hearing due to many years of DJ work and listening to music with headphones. Now my wife can turn the volume right to where she likes it while watching TV and I can go a notch or two higher on the headphones without me complaining about not being able to hear or her telling me to turn the TV down.  I can hear clearly from any room in our apartment even when the TV volume is barely audible. I haven't tried it with the computer and iTunes yet, but that's coming.  I made a good choice for the money! The controls are easy to use. The sound is crystal clear. The hearing range is beyond adequate. And my wife and I can sit in the same room to watch TV! Ta-da!"
R3BJ11M9QUPVT,1,"I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my wife.  It worked perfectly for a couple of weeks and then suddenly the transmitter started working only intermittently,often not at all.  I would not buy this product again or recommend it.  I definitely have buyers remorse about this purchase. Grrrrr."
R3K05AEXWU0PVM,3,"We bought this product for my hard-of-hearing father-in-law. He would continually crank up the TV to 99! (That's as high as it would go.) My mother-in-law was going crazy! This solved the problem, BUT...   I had to add an additional set of stereo speakers (Harmon-Kardan computer speaker set.)connected to a mini-plug \\""Y\\"" adapter from his TV's headphone jack. His TV had no auxiliary audio out on the back. (RCA. I probably would have run into the same situation even if it did.) The problem was that once something was connected to the 1/8\\"" mini-plug headphone jack, all audio from the TV speakers was disabled. If my mother-in-law wished to watch the same show as her husband, she was not able to hear it. Now they can adjust their own separate levels. Peace has been restored.   Just be advised when purchasing this or any other add-on headphones."
R3VUSUPQ8P335T,3,"My husband has severe hearing loss and these headphones, while good, were not what he needed to be able to watch TV and not disturb anyone else.  When he wore these headphones, anyone in the house could hear every word of the program without any sound coming from the TV.  All of the sound came from the headphones and was very annoying when I wanted to go to sleep.  I may as well have had the TV sound on.  The ear pieces are flat and not cushioned to cover the whole ear.  That would have muted the sound.  If someone does not have extreme hearing loss, they would have been fine."
R2KB0TW3F2AZQ1,4,"I bought this headphones as a gift for my father so he can listen freely while moving around the house. Before giving it to him, i decided to try it in my house first. Plus, I new that they have to be charged for 24 hours (or 12 hours, I can't remember) before the first use, so I figured it will be better to give it as a gift when they are ready to go!  First, I was very very disappointed. No matter what I did, I heard loud static noise, which was very periodic, and sounded like knocking (~ 60 knocks/sec). I tried all three channels on the base, I turned off my PC, router, every possible source of noise. I went to the basement, connected it to PC...and noise was still there. It was unbearable. Then, I realized that it could be the baby monitor. I have a child and the base of the monitor is always turned ON and it turned out that it always transmits, no matter whether the monitor itself is ON. The moment I turned off the base, the noise was gone and the sound in headphones was loud and clear. For me, this headphones would not work. I need the baby monitor. I cannot unplug it to listen to the music. However, if I did not use it, the headphones were great!  I gave it to my father, and I was glad to learn that neither his house, nor his neighbors, have a noise source that interfere with his headphones. He is extremely happy. He wears them for many hours every day, around his apartment, lays down on the couch, cook with them, you name it. Today, he went to the gym in his building, which is 2 stores down from him (but right under), and could hear very well (even while traveling in the elevator). Even though he claims that he does not hear any static, it is possible that due to his hearing, he may not pick up all the noise..but who knows...  The bottom line - it could be a waist of money if you have a wireless device in your home that just happen to work on the same frequency as the headphone (in my case it was a particular model of the baby monitor), or it can be a treasure, and let you truly disconnect and go around and enjoy you music, even outside of your apartment in the gym, like in the case of my father, all noise free! You have to give it a try and see."
R1Y67BQJMLL2H9,5,"My headphones stopped working after a month, a mere 11 days after the return window closed.  Tried new batteries, different channels but the transmitter base will not come on.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />Success!!!  Have been trying to figure out how to hook up wireless headphones to an LG LCD TV without a headphone jack.  I achieved success with the help of a store clerk at a big box store who knew what he was talking in recommending the RS120's which work like a charm with with the FiiO D3 optical to RCA converter.  These headphone do not hiss and have great range with good sound.  I use them while exercising and to overcome hearing loss.  They enable me to understand movies with background sounds combined with the clear sound settings on my TV.  I love the cradle induction rechargeable battery feature, the volume control on the headphones which operate independently of the volume controls on the TV.  I have a battery charger and an extra set of NiMH batteries so could start using the headphones right away.  Great headphones for the money.  So superior to using hard wire headphones.  I can hear the TV while walking the dog in the cul de sac."
R29DWGDT2AKT94,5,"These head phones are super easy to set up.  They only take less than 5 minutes just like the TV Ears the replace.  They are much more comfortable than TV Ears as they rest on your ears, not in them.  The sound is a little better than TV Ears.  The charging stand/transmitter is a little large so be sure you have a good place for it.  I like them. Update 10/29/2016.  I still use this product every day.  I am totally deaf in my left ear and any background noise (restaurants, fans, running water, etc.) make it difficult for me to hear well with my right ear.  This lightweight headset is perfect.  It puts the sound right to my good ear.  It is a great product and even through much use, I am still recharging the batteries that came with the unit.  When I said the unit is a little large, I should have said you need about the same space as a large mug of coffee.  Price is still the same as I paid nearly 5 years ago."
R1755O9LWW8XQQ,4,"Theses are the 2nd pair of wireless headphones I have owned and are by far the best. They help keep the peace around the house between my wife and I, I like it loud and she wants quiet. Guess who wins!! Sound quality is great and I have not had any interferance problems. The only issue I have is the size adjustment, for me they fit fine because I have a large head, but for the kids and my wife they are a bit big althoughthey stay on as long as they don't move around too much."
R30IRKPR284LUS,4,"Got the product for Christmas and so far it has performed great.  I use it when playing xbox, listening to tv/radio and downloads from various devices without disturbing anyone else.  The sound quality is very good, am able to walk around the house (two story) without missing a note.  I would recommend it."
R2H4Y2HIXEQQAZ,5,"Model RS120 is not designed for recording studios so do not expect recording studio performance. It is designed for home users and, in my opinion, RS120 delivers what I expected: reasonable price, comfort of use, long lasting batteries and the most important, good quality sound. It works great with my radio, TV, computer and CD player. I'm freely moving around my home, from the basement to the garage, enjoying my favorite programs and quality sound. For me every dollar spent on RS120 was a good investment."
R1PW8N9FSEJFWY,5,This product is well-made. It has good volume control and is sturdy. You cannot hear outside noise and the outside cannot hear noise from the headphones. I highly recommend.
R3UTDV93MT21FB,5,"After trying 4 other wireless headsets to use with my new flat screen TV I finally found the perfect set. I bought 4 other sets ranging from $19.95- $120.00 and bought the Sennheiser RS120's for around $60.00. Priced right in the middle but the performance is top notch. Compared to all the others, Sony included, these were the best sounding and easiest to wear pair I ever found. There was always a problem with the others. They were uncomfortable, they wouldn't work, static, too hot over my ears and odd sounding, not realistic sounding. From the minute I put these on I knew I had found the perfect pair. At a hell of a price, compared to whats out there under $150.00. I have only had them a short time but I am very pleased and see no reason to feel any differently. I bought these from Amazon and received them only a few days later. I have bought 5 different items from Amazon in the last couple of weeks and everything has arrived very promptly."
R3RPFINRZT3VHQ,5,"The Sennheiser wireless headphones have proven to be a great purchase.  Easy setup (once you know what you're doing), great sound, and a price that can't be beat.  My husband uses these at night so I can sleep and and he can watch TV without bothering me.  I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking to purchase wireless headphones."
R1X5QF3RSQP6O0,4,"These headphones are perfect - sound is good, headset is comfortable.  They are great for removing the tv  from the center of action, when only one of us around the house wants to watch. My husband can watch the football game on a Sunday afternoon while, three feet away,  five kids joke and fool around. One of us can watch tv at night without waking the others, and I can work on the computer in the same room where kids want to watch a show after school.  No hissing problem. The dead sound doesn't trigger the second they lose a connection -  I don't find it all annoying - just use the off switch on the headphones to quickly cut it.  Amazing price for such quality. Amazing quality for such a price."
R1NM2N7UV0SU2Q,5,"I really like these headphones!  At first, after having used some larger, heavier old Panasonic headphones for years, they felt a little strange on the top of my head, being able to feel the recharging contact points.  After having adjusted to them, they now feel light and comfortable.  The sound quality is great, living up to the Sennheiser brand name, which I have been familiar with for approx. 40 years.  My TV is located on the second floor of a fairly big home, and there is very little drop off in sound quality when going down into my basement (a slight tuning adjustment on the headset corrects this).  F.Y.I.  I will definitely be buying a second unit for another TV set in the home."
R2VQY49N03BNQI,5,"This is probably my first product review; I am used to reading reviews as part of my research, but not writing one. These headphones blow my mind and compelled me to write a review  I have to say, before doing any research I never heard about this brand before. But I was looking for something with good quality and reasonable price. I'd have loved to buy a Bose, but they are mighty expensive and I did not think they're worth few hundred dollars. I was also looking into the higher end ones from Sennheiser, but then I decided they're close to the BOSE (which I tested in a store and they're very good) then I decided to take my chances and buy it especially with a reasonable price under $60. When I got them, I could not believe the clarity of the sound. For example, I heard things while watching football game that I never heard watching just the TV with no Head phones.  If you're debating whether to get the R120 or he R110, go for the R120 (it's a bit more money) as it has a rechargeable battery and I have had them for a month now....never had an issue with the batter, range or the clarity of the sound.  It's simply AMAZIING! I wish there are more than 5 stars to give this product.  I highly recommend it to any one!"
R17RZBERWK3BVX,5,"Great sound, easy to install, and very practical.  Now I can go to other rooms, still listen to what is playing and not bother anyone!  GREATLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
R18DOSX252Z3PO,5,These headphones fit my criteria of a good price for good quality.  I got these for my husband for Christmas and he was thrilled with the sound and comfort.
R2RPZTIV9ZTE2O,5,"I bought this exact model four years ago and they have worked great until just recently. I replaced them with an identical model am still as pleased as every. They are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent, they're no bose but for normal tv use they work great. The rechargeable batteries run for days on one charge."
R16H8NIT0PEMRB,5,"This is a high quality product.  I and my wife have used it and enjoy the high quality sound.  When either one of us falls asleep, the other uses this product so as not to disturb the sleeper.  Great product--great value."
R39J6H918C4E88,5,My husband's hearing is very challenged and he watches WAY too much TV. I cannot be in the same room with him because of the volume on the TV. These headphones have solved that problem completely. I can either watch TV at a volume comfortable for me or read without being disturbed by any noise. My husband finds something wrong with everything but has yet to find fault with the headphones AND he can walk around the house or go outside while listening to his talk shows.
R3R156NJDKTMDS,1,"The headphones worked perfectly the first time I used them. Put them back on the cradle to charge. The next time I went to use them, all I got was hissssss. Called Sennheiser. The problem was everything under the sun ... but the headphones: I didn't have the volume turned up loud enough, I apparently was incompetent to scan through the dial from one end to the other, I didn't have them plugged in correctly, blah blah BS! BS! blah! Was told to return the product; would be 2 to 3 weeks turnaround for either repair or replace. I shipped them to Sennheiser. No word if they ever received them. No word if there's a prognosis. No word if there's going to be a fix. No word if and when I might get them back. No word, period! Communication sucks! I emailed them, got a generic reply stating that it would be 4 weeks turnaround. If you're thinking you're getting these at a good price, tack on an extra $9.35 cost to ship them back to Sennheiser."
RQND1DK21QGSO,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle is a GREAT product...especially for the hearing impaired...and \\""technically challenged\\""!! We purchased this headset for my, soon to be, 86 year old father who wears two hearing aids & is \\""technically challenged\\"" when it comes to the newer televisions, cable box connections, etc and he is loving it!!! He connected it himself and loves the sound quality and the comfort of the headphones. He even left the room he was watching TV in without removing the headphones, walked to the other end of the house (and it's a large house) and still could hear what was transpiring on his television show!!! My Mom is loving it, too, because she no longer has to endure the television at full volume! We highly recommend this product!!!!"
R2PT21BI1CVDNK,5,"I work in a machine shop and use these all day, excellent reception. Highly recommended. Also, uses regular nicad rechargeable batteries, so you can change them yourself when they lose their life. Great item for 59 bucks.  Mike"
R3438GGIDC4QFI,2,"I owned these for almost a month before i decided to return them and just spend the extra cash on the RS170. Originally I just wanted a cheap wireless headset so I could watch movies and listen to music on my bed. Anyways here is my analysis after a month's use:  Pros  - charging cradle (super convenient, no batteries, acts as stand for headphones)  - ease of use (plug transmitter into sound source...turn on headphones, done, may need to adjust tuning)  - price  Cons  - interference (occasional buzzing, zapping noise, picks up telephone conversations)  - easily slips off of head  - \\""open ear\\"" design let people easily hear what's playing in your headphones.  Like i mentioned above, i eventually returned these and got the more expensive rs170. I've been using the rs170 for the past few days now and already I'm having a much better experience with these. Barely any interference, more comfortable, and the cradle looks cooler. It also has more features like bass and surround. No need for tuning as well!"
R3MYV5ZK1NPE2I,5,"Good fast shipping. Excellent headphones. Got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. Was going to get Bose, but saved money buying these and they have excellent sound. Why pay more? Good product."
R1NGM034V8BYKM,1,"Having read many of the reviews of the 4 and 5 stars, I thought the one star reviews must have gotten faulty products.  So I went ahead and got the headphones. Well, I experienced all the things that are wrong with this product.  Namely, that it has an auto-shutoff whenever there is a drop in volume on the TV programs...giving a very load hissing noice.  Thought maybe this would only happen every once in a great while...so I hung in there because when the headphones are working the sound is very nice.  But the shutoff is very frequent and thus too annoying."
RB2UVQDEUTSL7,5,"Works GREAT, plus the price is even better. Really happy with quality of Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle."
RBD4DZPIT9EPH,5,For the money I paid for these wireless headphones They're really GREAT.They do everything they are suppose to do and more;    I don't thank you can go wrong with these!!
R3R829Z20GJGY5,5,"I bought these for my fiance for Christmas, He says they sound great, don't hurt his head, and for the reasonable price I paid, I wont get any headaches. I have very sensitive ears and he is starting to lose his hearing..Works great for us..he can hear at his level, and I can hear at my level! The only thing is, I have to repeat myself because he will talk to me, I will answer him, then he will take off his headset so he can hear me...grrrrr.. He is free to move about with the headset on and he can still hear..so kitchen run..no problem, bathroom..no problem. I would recommend these to anyone..well worth the money spent!"
R24UC0V6NIN3XH,5,"My husband requested these for Christmas. He is now able to block out the sound of my TV programs coming from the bedroom.  Also, he loves hearing his music \\""up close and personal\\"".  When he wakes up in the morn, he never liked disturbing me with sound, but he always likes the TV on to catch the morning news and weather.  I am so happy that he is happy with his new toy!"
R1KO5MNTX5POR5,5,"I had tried two other brands before sennheiser. The first pair had good reception but were uncomfortable, The headphones did not cover my ears and put pressure on my glasses. The second pair were very comfortable but had poor reception. The Sennheiser headphones are comfortable and have good reception. I wear them while I'm working and I am able to hear the phone. They were less expensive and worked well."
R107ZGY5H48QOW,5,I really like these headphones and I have told other people about them and 3 of them have bought them from Amazon.com. They also are pleased with them. For a person who has a hearing problem they are great.
R1M08490HLNJ44,4,"Received in about one week (free shipping from amazon) including holiday date.  Sennheiser RF120 worked very good once hooked up.  My new TV (HiSence 46\\"") did NOT have a way to adjust the mute when using this headset.  My hearing is not what is used to be.  So to help my wife who does not like the TV so loud this would do the job.  But when you plug in this headset the sound on the TV is gone just like mute.  No adjustment on my TV or Headset.  Did plug the headset into the DISH box.  That works great.  Unless I want to use with a DVD or stereo.  Not been there yet.  Would have to find audio out and plug in.  The only other problem is the head set is loose.  Not much \\""spring\\"" to push tight to your ears.  Lean over and they would fall off.  Need more \\""cush\\"" on the ears might hold then on better.  They ARE adjustable for big and small head.  Just not TIGHT on the ears.  I would give 4 stars.  Great price at Amazon."
R23VLAOF7TBYS8,5,Bought this headphones as a Christmas present for my husband. He love the quality of the sound and I love  that I can sleep while he is watching TV.
RE64US4KIYX8P,5,Bought these for my wife.  Clear sound.  Antenna is about 25 feet away.  Occasional static.  Ears are comfy.  Good product for the $ spent.
R2ISFGA06TOKD4,5,"I purchased the RS120 headphone/charger system and a second pair of [[ASIN:B000EBPJCO Sennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphones]] (without a charger) for my wife and I to use in our bedroom so that we could watch a little TV without waking our sleeping toddler across the hall.  We've had them for about two weeks now and have used them on numerous occasions.  They work very well.  Sound quality is fine.  These are not audiophile Sennheisers, they're not priced as if they were.  They are not intended for critical listening, or for reproducing 7.1 theater sound systems.  They are simple stereo wireless headphones.<br /><br />Our bedroom TV is wall mounted (using this [[ASIN:B001OCY3RY VideoSecu Low Profile TV Wall Mount]]) and I have all the cables routed inside the wall including the audio cable that connects to the headphone base.  The base itself is located in the room next to our bedroom (my office).  Since the headphones use RF (instead of IR) the signal goes right through the wall.  RF interference has not been a problem either (the house is saturated with wireless signals and the base is located in a room with two or three computers that are running all the time).<br /><br />Range is good.  I haven't tested the limit of the range, but the headphones work everywhere in the house (meaning we can walk downstairs to the kitchen while still listening to the TV).<br /><br />Setup was very simple.  Plug the base in, connect the audio cable to the TV. Charge the headphones.  Turn them on.  Tune them and you have audio.<br /><br />Things the be aware of:<br /><br />1. The base has a 3.5mm (standard mini headphone size) stereo input jack and comes with an stereo RCA-to-3.5mm converter and a fairly long stereo RCA cable (long enough for my needs by far).  Your TV needs to have analog audio outputs.  The base does NOT have digital audio inputs.  The outputs on your TV will be fixed level, or variable-level (or user selectable).  Our Vizio TV has selectable outputs and I selected fixed-level.  This means that the headphones are used to control the volume instead of the TV remote.  For us, this works well as we can each independently adjust the volume without affecting the other listener.  (The downside? The mute button on the TV remote does nothing).<br /><br />2. I have two headphones, but the charging station can only charge one at a time.  This isn't a problem. You just need to be aware that you can only fit one at a time on the charger and manage your charging so you don't end up with a dead battery when you need them.<br /><br />3. I'm still on my first charge cycle and we've used the headphones for at least 5 hours over the last two weeks.  So far no sign of running them out.<br /><br />4. The headphones use standard AAA NiMH batteries (provided).  I'm considering buying a few more just so I have a few charged ready-to-go batteries around in case I do ever forget to charge the headphones (and our baby monitor uses the same).<br /><br />5. I did not mount my base on the wall (it just sits on my desk), but it does have a single keyhole mount slot.  I don't think it would look very good stuck on the wall, but if needed, it'll work.<br /><br />6. This is the only drawback I've found so far, but at this price point I didn't really consider this a negative:  The headphones are not the type that go over your ears.  The lay flat on the ear.  There is no surround.  Some people might find this uncomfortable during a long listening session.  When I first put them on, my initial reaction was: \\""these are not going to be comfortable\\"".  But after using them for a while now, they really are not too bad.  The comfort isn't great, but not bad either.  The other trait with the lack of a surround is that they do not isolate sound.  You can hear other noises in the room (good for us, we can here the baby monitor), but you can also hear the other person's headphones if they are listening at a loud level (and your trying to read a book,or sleep).  Again, only a problem if the other person is cranking it up.  This hasn't been a problem for us.  I've never heard my wife's headphones while I read or sleep.<br /><br />So I give these 5 stars because they met my expectations in every way.  I was not expecting high-end audio, but I was expecting easy setup and decent sound quality for a reasonable price.  And that's what I got.for us.  I've never heard my wife's headphones while I read or sleep.  So I give these 5 stars because they met my expectations in every way.  I was not expecting high-end audio, but I was expecting easy setup and decent sound quality for a reasonable price.  And that's what I got."
RR9EVAHR57UZZ,3,"I really wanted to give these headphones a higher rating and based solely on performance and price could have easily rated them a solid four, but they are after all made supposedly to fit the human head. There shape, out of the box doesn't resemble the upper hemisphere of any human cranium that I have ever seen. If you remain motionless they will stay in place, but come on Sennheiser these are wireless which would seem to indicate that the wearer can move about with them on. My hat size is 7 3/8\\"" which is far from small and no mater how I adjust them, they will fall off my head if I bend forward even a small amount. Now you can see that this would be a major problem if one forgot to remove them before relieving one's self! I solved the problem by removing the waist band from a pair of jockey shorts and using that around the outside to keep them secure. I think before summer however, I will find a loose fitting sweat band which should work fine and will look better to the neighbors while mowing the lawn. In closing, unless your head is the size of a five gallon bucket, these will not stay on your head without help."
R26EENIIF8FOB,5,"This product does what it says...it really works.  As a professional videographer I'm familiar with Sennheiser audio equipment.  They have an excellent reputation and these headphones live up to their reputation.  I recommend these to anyone who needs to assistance in hearing TV dialogue.  They have excellent range, almost as good as Sennheiser's wireless mics. The rechargeable batteries are a convenient feature not found on some other headsets.  The headphone base is a bit top heavy causing it to tip over if you don't take care when placing the headset on the rechargeable base."
R1NF8B7Q4E4E4V,4,"These have great sound quality, and are very comfortable. The annoying static or hiss that people refer to in other reviews only occurs when it is not receiving a signal, so if you put them on while your system is off you'll hear static, or if you don't have the headset tuned to the transmitter properly (this is really easy to do since the tuner control is right on the headset)."
RXEGXXF33A87P,5,"Purchased these wireless headphones for my husband who is hearing impaired.  Even though he wears hearing aids, he would still miss about 75% of the dialog during TV shows and DVDs.  He can now hear everything clear as a bell.  He does not miss any dialog and also can hear the background music and sound effects. His face just lit up the first time he watched his favorite movie!  He is telling all of his friends that wear hearing aids about theses headphones.  The headphones were easy to set up, easy to adjust the sound and volume.  The sound quality is excellent. This product is fantastic for folks who have difficulty hearing their favorite shows and movies and well worth the price."
R373L34J92ZKG0,5,"I am pretty picky when it comes to sound quality and I am very satisfied with these. I have mainly used them to watch TV and movies late at night but I found that at both low and high volumes they work well, the sound is good, etc. I have never run out of batteries and they don't look bad sitting out.  I have used them to listen to music while doing work around the house and found the range to be good as well. When I ventured outside the house (so good distance and a few walls) there was noticeable increase in noise and a few whips of static but I was pretty far away...and they are wireless headphones after all :)  All together very pleased and they are more comfortable than I imagined they would be. Not too tight, not too heavy, etc. Have never been dissatisfied with Sennheiser phones..."
R19JZASM3607PV,5,"I purchased the headphones about a week  ago (from Amazon) after studying reviews of several of the headphones.  They are terrific.  I have a slight hearing loss (I got old and too much rock and roll and motorcycles) and I was sometimes backing a movie up to listen to some of the dialogue.  I have a Bose surround sound system and I thought it was pretty good until I listened with these headphones. The clarity of the sound is excellent. When you use the headphones you are not turning up the volume you are hearing crystal clear sound. There is no problem understanding any of the dialogue and you hear backgrond sounds (for example, birds chirping in a Western scene) that you did not hear before.  When I received the headphones,  I plugged them into the cable box like some of the other reviewers suggested and followed the set up directions. Perfect. I have recommended them to my friends."
R50UAA0C95PXB,5,These headphones are very good in sound and convenience. The charger is easy to use and all of the controls are easy to use and accessible. They allow me to hear the TV with my bad hearing and save my wife's ears as well.
R3Q5R29LEQAL4D,5,"These are good. I can hear in any room of the house. Of course it does sound better when I am near the transmitter, but sound is clear when I am not. I would buy again."
R1P4S30YGWRJS9,4,Get great reception and sounds is good.  The only thing I would improve is the earphone piece - make the a little more traditional with a pad set off instead of a flat piece.
R161MQARQ9RUZA,5,"This device was purchased as a gift for my wife who has been having trouble hearing the TV.  She has been thrilled with its performance.  She can move about the house and still hear the program.  I did have a problem with connecting to the TV and had to connect it to the bedroom TV, so she has to go to the bedroom to change chanels.  This is because our new Samsung 43\\"" does not have \\""Audio Out\\"" jacks.  That would be something to look for before you purchase this type of product."
R3PMHSEKMBKEJR,4,"This provides clear reception for everyday audio.  There is a background humming before your audio comes on, but not noticeable once it's in use.  Considering this is 20% of the cost of high end models, it's well worth it."
RXLTASZ4A2D1Z,4,"Haven't used them much, but I'm pretty pleased.  The only complaint is having to manually tune them yourself, or else there will be tons of static.  Great price.  Not sure you can get a better pair for less money."
R30OLRYHYS14SD,5,Bought this for my father in law and both he and my mother in law are extremely satisfied.  No more loud TV.
R83CSUJ0P0HCF,3,"They sounded just fine to me.  The real downfall is that the earcups are flat and very firm.  There is no place for the ears to go.  As a result, one's ears are crushed between the very firm ear cups and skull.  Otherwise, the ear cups press very hard against the side of the head.  The cartillage in front of one ear now creaks or flexes when it moves due to the pressure of the headphones."
R1AFBAGXAH1F1J,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my college freshman son.  He pronounced the headphones \\""awesome\\"" and has used them every day since."
R1M1SQV2UM28RR,5,"Did a lot of searching and reading reviews before purchasing and am so glad I did purchase these. I work different shifts and often watch TV at night when everyone else is sleeping. These have good sound quality and no interference. Very easy to set up but you must have an audio output on your TV which most newer televisions have. People have mentioned that the power plug is a problem but its not. Some people have complained about them cutting off, I have not had this problem, as long as my TV is on and its on a channel that has something on, they have not shut off. They do automatically shut off after turning the TV off.  For the price, you cant go wrong! Good sound, good quality and work as advertised."
R17TSULX8F7IUR,5,"I'm so happy with my Sennheiser RS120 headphones that I ordered a second pair.  Each headphone will work with either transmitter so two people can hear at once.  There is no noise on these headphones in my block house.  I walked to the mailbox and it was still great!  I walked to the neighbors mailbox and had just a touch of static.  I can go all over the house, including the garage and it's great.  If I go to my detached shop there is a bit of static.  These are much better than the old RCA (quite a few years old) headphones, and the charging system is very easy.  Highly recommended."
R1KIQLBPSERQGV,1,"These were absolutely terrible.  The annoying buzzing sound in the background while you listen to anything was not my major concern, as the headphones are wireless, and you can expect some reception interference.  The major problem is that it took about a year before the reception almost completely stopped working, and the volume nob, if even slightly bumped, causes all of the sound to stop coming out of the left ear speaker.  In short, I have found more durable headphones at a dollar store."
R3IRVD8PM3PRD3,5,This headphone is really great. Has proper clarity with almost noise cancelling feature. Also you do not need to increase volume to high level because it covers high sound at low level. It is a great headphone!
R30DJ4IDV03G9J,4,"I'm very pleased with the headphones. I live in a ground floor apartment who experienced a \\""noisy neighbor\\"" who resides above me. The constant creaking of the floorboards and his \\""stomping\\"" was aggravating and I needed a solution. I decided to try the SR120's after reading the reviews. Foremost, I suggest that anyone experiencing problems or those of you that are unsure to checkout [...] first; they have extensive and reliable information that will answer any of your questions. The headphones work flawlessly and provide excellent sound reproduction, a terrific value for the money and spending the extra money is an investment in quality. My only suggestion for Senneheiser is that the quality of the connections is mediocre. Quality headphones should have quality wiring. By design the leads are wired into the unit approximately 8' in length; I feel that they should of made female RCA jacks from the back so you can just insert patch cords of better quality and your choice to easily attach. My receiver is placed in a corner location, one foot above ground level and is in between my TV set and stereo system. I purchased Acoustic Research PR162 audio video cables with 24k connectors, shielded wiring,  12' foot in length along with couplers to extend the reach of the cables from Amazon for $20; those AR PR162's retail for $65 each, Amazon had them for $9 each (those cables are 12' and include Video and Audio cables, I received 72' of quality wire for a mere 24 cents a foot) Buy them if they are still available!! That made a significant improvement in sound and also allows me to easily switch from the TV to the stereo. Yes the tuning and volume \\""wheels\\"" are quite sensitive but once you adjust them to your liking, and after familiarizing yourself with the headphones, there not a problem. I no longer hear the noise from above, can peruse my apartment with very little interference. I hear a slight \\""click\\"" when the furnace kicks in but that is all. Overall rating of 4.5 this isa quality product that is well worth the investment; If I were to buy wireless headphones.....buy Senneheiser !"
R254CYC3IH5EAY,4,"When I first got the item it worked great. A few days later I was not getting sound in the right head phone.  I tried using the tuning wheel on the head phone which seems to adjust for this situation, but it was way too sensitive.  After several tries at other things, I did something a little weird. I went to the back of my TV and switched the audio input jacks. I put the the Sennheiser red jack into the TV's white input and the Sennheiser black jack into the TV's red input.  Now it works great.  Go figure !!!!!!!!!!    I do especially love that this device works on radio waves.  Lets me walk all over the house and even outside and still hear my show this is great."
R1PZ5POQPEPYD3,1,"I purchased these headphones during the Christmas season to replace a set of \\""TV Ears\\"" that function identically to these headphones. I wanted to upgrade to better quality but was sadly dissapointed when I got nothing but static from this set. The hookup was identical to TV Ears so there was no doubt they just didn't work. When I returned them to Amazon I could have asked for a replacement but the plastic base appeared to be so cheaply made (light plastic) that I decided not to bother. All in all I would say Quality Control on this product is poor and I would expect more problems from them in the future."
RJWQEYRKHK48Q,4,I bought the headphones as a present for my father and was impressed with the quality of sound (and volume).  However the tuning button is located next to the volume button.  This is problematic in that every time he adjusts the sound he changes the tuning and becomes frustrated when the headphones 'no longer work'.
RMWQ0P7WXFHPH,2,"I had several problems with this product.    First, the good parts:  I'm hardly an audio expert, but the sound these headphones gave out was pretty good.  The charging system was also nice.    However, these good parts are overridden by the problems i had.  First, the headphones came with an RCA to headphone jack adapter.  This adapter was so fiddly i had to mess with it for about a minute to get it in a position where it was successfully getting audio.  They really would have benefitted from including a more dependable adapter for those of us who need to use it.  This problem seems to have gotten worse on the second day of me using the headphones, however.  Now i cannot get them to have a good connection no matter how much i mess with the adapter.  The headphones also (when they were working) had a quiet but audible static sound in the background and would skip occasionally at distances a decent bit shorter than the advertised range of 300 feet.  I'd say more like 100 ft is a more realistic range.  It is possible that the fact that i live in the city was responsible for the reduced practical range. Still, this wouldnt have been enough for me to return them if i hadn't also been experiencing the first problem.  I'd say be careful of these.  If you have an RCA jack or are the kind of person who wouldn't be bothered by a little static, these still might be a good buy, but don't expect them to be perfect or you may end up returning them like me."
R3JHGWS3CMH428,5,The sound quality is excellent and works throughout my house so never miss parts of broadcasts-the price was good and it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time
R3KFXH85PHCAFB,5,"WE ARE OLD PEOPLE THESE MAKE TV A PLEASURE! BEFORE WE WOULD MISS HEARING THE SCRIPT, NOW IT IS GREAT."
R1DJCA0PX3SWIX,5,Ordered this for my husband and he loves it. The quality of sound is as promised. It has the great sound of a much more expensive headset! It was extremely easy to install on the TV and there is no static! He uses this throughout the house and even when he grills on the deck...It was great during the holiday bowl games...he did not miss a play! He has told me over and over how much he loves this headset! Oh and by the way..the batteries are rechargeable!! Very worth the money!! order it...you will not be disappointed!!!
R1QZWB39K4ICY5,2,"Headphones are well built, and the sound quality is awesome. Great clarity and base, however, in my opinion, there's a design flaw that prevents these from being practical.  The ear cushions are flat instead of hollow, so they press against the ears, instead of surrounding them, making them very uncomfortable, and after about 30 minutes my ears started to hurt. They also get pretty warm, perhaps for the same reason. It's a shame because the sound was great.  Tried to like them and wish they would have fit better, but unfortunately I will have to look elsewhere."
RCUG4L8EYMGMV,4,"I own a set of RS180s - of course, they have less issues, but look at the cost. I use these primarily in my office at a short distance. Unlike the RS180, this set will not go through walls well or cover a great distance without having dropout and distortion issues. And every issue I had with the RS180 AGC is intensified here (oh well, I expected it).<br /><br />But... on a positive note, the controls are simple (unlike RS180) and I think I got what I paid for. It does a good job short range - say, 10-15'. If you try to go through walls, you will hear a kind a \\""swish\\"" as it loses the base signal. Without a wall in between the line of sight, you might manage 30' or so.<br /><br />This would be a great set for short distance without walls, and the sound quality is good, comfort good, operation simple. I recommend it highly to my brother-in-law who watches TV in his bedroom after his wife has gone to bed.<br /><br />A note: when you connect them to a power source, the ON/OFF LED won't illuminate until you feed it an audio signal. Shame the brief manual included does not mention that. The documentation is actually quite poor and lacking in details."
R1JAB5NV46CQ18,5,"I bought these headphones because I have Tinnitus and have trouble hearing the TV at low levels.  Wouldn't you guess that my wife has above average hearing and prefers everything at low levels.  So I got these awsome headphones for our bedroom, when we watch tv late at night.  They are incredible.  They are crystal clear and have great sound.  I don't know why I waited so long.  I'm planning on buying another pair for my living room.  My experience with Amazon was, as always, easy and I got a great price.  I am very satisfied."
R215MMN71TOS21,1,"Not working, noise sound only, I try many time but nothing operation, can not use it. Now I'm so far to take to warranty. So bad product, never buy this !"
R1EX3WFCDORHH2,4,"Really like these headphones. They sound great. Easy to hook up. I listen to them when the wife goes to bed at night. They even work in another room from the base. The padded ears are a little hard to get used to, They want to fall off your head very easy. Don't plan to dance with these on."
R2W6VDD1YLA045,5,"I needed a set of wireless headphones to keep peace in the house.  After considerable research, I settled on the Sennheiser RS120 in that they seemed to be the best bang for the buck, and they enjoyed great reviews.  Setup was done in minutes, and I left the batteries to charge.  They are incredibly comfortable, and I was particularly astounded by the range and fidelity.  These devices never seem to have the advertised range.  Today, for example, I took them to the opposite end of the house, upstairs, and tucked into a corner bathroom which goes through numerous walls and is quite far from the transmitter.  Not the slightest bit of noise - the sound (music in this case) was incredible.  This unit accomplishes everything it advertises!  There are many more expensive units out there, but I cannot imagine what they might do that these do not accomplish.  I am an audiophile, BTW, with some rather high end sound equipment.  These make me quite happy.  If you need a set of wireless headphones, your search is over!"
R3NBP9UGRYAVPS,4,The sound quality of these headphones are very good.  I have them hooked up to my Siruis receiver.  I wear these at work usually 8-10 hrs a day.  They are not to heavy and are fairly comfortable to wear!
REYA5LITSNGVT,5,Headphones were as advertised and are excellent value for the money.  The work well in house and in our motorhome. It took 12 hours for the batteries to charge and then  it was easy listening. Highly recommended
R1WKRRJ99XYNS1,4,"I got this to avoid dueling tv sound with the other tv in the family room.  I received another brand as a xmas gift and returned it, it did not work out of the box, defective power connection/cord.  When I went to the store to return it they had 6 on the shelf that had been returned open, so I took cash back.  I then used the online reviews on Amazon to find a better quality headset.  This headset was is higher quality than the other one, that didn't even work.  It charges without contacts when put on the cradle.  I left it on overnight and the next day, and was still able to use it for 4 more hours!  The batteries on the first unit I returned to the store, were difficult to install, you actually had to pull off the ear cover and put it back on.  I was lucky and it did not tear, but close.  The Sennheiser has a bayonet type earpiece that you twist off, very nice!  Sound is clear and only an occasional hiss, maybe a couple of times in 4 hours.  It is a little tricky to tune in the frequency for good sound, but stays tuned.  You have to get used to the location of the controls as the volume and tuning are above/below each other.  I am happy with the purchase."
R3KKMARG059ORY,5,These are a wonderful product. The sound is crystal clear and the range on them is quite far. They're also very comfortable. Well worth the money. We will be buying this brand again.
R2X5VN2CGIWSG,1,"Well, I got this product based on the reviews on this site, and I have to say, I am very disapointed with the quality of these headphones that carry the Sennheiser name. What cheap junk these headphone are! Super crappy sound quality, a hiss like a vinyl record you can't get rid of no matter what channel you put it on. The sound quality is a bit better than AM radio. Don't waist your money on these. If you are into high quality sound, these are not for you. I think sony makes better ones that are acceptable quality sound,  but certainly much better than these. I have a new nickname for them as I will use them on my computer, Suckheiser."
R4P486M9Y2OZG,5,"I am not electronically savvy, but can follow directions and thanks to the diagrams especially, the earphones were easy to get up and running. Then, in comparison to my former phones, I am enjoying the lack of static and noise interference and the much enlarged area of reception. Also, they are just plain comfortable to use."
R2NK2ILBLG3A7X,5,"I purchased this RS120 somewhat unsure as to how to couple 2 headphones to my TV. I had purchased a Sony product a while back, but currently I am unable to add to its system in order to get 2 headphones. I looked in detail about various products and certainly Sennheiser has an excellent reputation. Looking at the dual application, though, they recommended an individual headphone another 120 but with different letters that didn't come with a transmitter/charging station. Ironically, both were about equally priced. On contacting customer service at Amazon, the advisor looked at the Sennheiser website and determined that the recommended headphone was exactly the one shown as the RS120 with the only difference being the charging station. I was concerned that without the station I would not be able to keep both headphones charged so I just purchased 2 of the RS120. So far it was a wise decision it appears. I have the primary charger/transmitter plugged into the front of my amplifier in the headphone jack. I use it for transmission to both headphones that I and my wife use. I then have both stations plugged also into 110v.and am able to charge both headphones as needed. I am surprised that for the $8 difference that one would want to not get the charging station for the second headphone.     Both headphones are great in terms of their ease of use and quality of performance. We use them because I am hard of hearing and my wife can hear the proverbial pin drop. By using the headphones, we both can adjust the volume to our need. Regular tv isn't a problem...just when we watch a DVD movie where the sound dynamics varies and voices are difficult to decipher. With this setup, it is just perfect. We have only had it for a week or so, so it may have problems down the road. I hope not, but just wanted to let anyone interested in a setup as I arranged to know that it works fine and getting the two with charging capability seems the better way to go."
R3E60IQOI5O7O2,3,"I used to have a wireless unit with an RF signal that was small, and you could plug in/use your own headphones. Of course, it was so good, it was discontinued. I watch TV late at night and don't want to bother my neighbors, so when the last set I had bit the dust, I just started using a long cable from my TV's audio out -- and staying put in the room, obviously.<br />I kept hoping to find something similar to my old wireless set on the Net, but never did, so I finally broke down and got this pair of headphones. They're a bit too big for my head (female, 5' 4\\""), but they work great. Once I tuned in the signal (no problem), I could walk around my apartment and pretty much hear from wherever I was. Not a big apartment, but lots of walls. They're comfortable enough and the sound is pretty good. I put them back on the stand at night to recharge and, so far, the charge has not run out while I've been using them to watch TV. I particularly like the on/off switch on the left ear side.<br />I would recommend them."
R5DGC6450X7LJ,4,"I am very hard of hearing and I have gone through two sets of TV EARS. The fault is mine as I fall asleep and weaken the conection between the ear piece and the receiver. I ordered SENNHEISER headphones as the looked to be sturdier and they are. The sound is very good, and I was surprised to get stereo from our T.V. I would recommend to anyone hard of hearing or anyone who did not want to disturb their spouse. The only negative thing I have to make is the back ground music is louder than normal."
R2P6H8863B9A5W,4,"Bought these wireless headphones for our bedroom. Frequently one of us goes to sleep earlier than the other. Keeping the TV volume low enough not to disturb each other but still being able to hear the TV was always a problem. Not anymore. Hooked up the headphone base to the audio outputs of the TV, inserted the batteries in the headphones, let them charge for a day and our problem was solved. We are now able to turn the volume all the way down on the TV and still hear perfectly through the headphones. No more arguing about noise from the TV.  No static, no hiss, the range covers our entire 2300sq ft ranch and battery life has been great. Not much bass but sounds fine for watching TV. Have never tried them with a music source.  Two minor issues. Instructions were pretty much non-existent but it is not a complicated device. The other issue is that the tuning control is located directly under the volume control. It is very easy to accidentally bump the tuning control when adjusting the volume. This can cause an annoying blast of static until it is readjusted. Completely unnecessary inconvenience. Plenty of space elsewhere for the tuning control.  Four stars instead of five because of the poor instructions and poor choice of location for tuning control."
R1ZDVB9TPVSYTS,4,"Bought it to listen to sports or play my playstation without waking up our 7 month old. Works great. Reasonably comfortable (had it on for 2 hours without my ears getting sore). The base is a little clumsy. The ear pieces could fit better. But overall, Im happy."
RCDDBWFSPLOII,4,"Ordered 2 and 1 didn't work well.Sent 1 back.The remaining set is Excellent for listening without annoying partner.The only small annoyances are the controls are too close together and the headset could be more comfortable.  The sound quality is perfect,no hissing/no outside noise.  Would recommend!"
R2BUZIAYVWIHRJ,4,Pros:  Great headphones for the price. Worked right out of the box. Good sound. Charges battery's very well.  Cons:  They fit a little loose on your head and slide off when bending over.
R18RMSWFMT2S8I,4,"This model does NOT have a separate volume control for each ear. Seems louder in my left ear where the volume control is located.  Wish I could get the volume in the right ears louder, so it would be balanced."
R3R4E5YRYF7750,5,"Well now, after havin to have the volume up so high for years on our TV so's I could follow the dialog w-out \\""captions\\"" & purchasin and discardin several other types of audio enhancin *earpiece* pieces of junk, I decided to give THESE a try --<br /><br />WUNDERBAR!  I'm VERY pleased!  Actually have to turn the TV volume UP from 16 [ where I can now hear it jist fine ] to 22 so wife can hear it --  :)  usta have it up to 40! -- and *then* it was difficult for me.<br /><br />Better still, I kin walk into the kitchen for a snack and not miss any of the dialog goin on!<br /><br />Fit comfortable -- just haveta remember to not bend over suddenly or they fall off<br /><br />VERY satisfied with this product!"
R363MK4EW8LW9P,5,"My husband and I both work midnight shift. I sleep in the morning when we get home and he sleeps in the evenings. We could not watch action movies on TV due to one of us always sleeping, so we requested a set of headphones for Christmas and we were blessed by our son and his wife with this brand of headphones. I can't tell you how pleased we are to have them. The sound is amazing on them and I can even wear them in our kitchen while working in there and never miss a thing said on the TV. Our problem is solved and we never get startled awake when the action movies get loud. I highly recommend this product."
R2ZV6864UC92WC,3,Sound quality is very good but headset is not comfortable to wear ..... not sure the design of the head strap and ear pads is correct!
R2KK16GAXL8Y49,4,Works as advertised.  Has particularly good high end response ..really good for movies with lousy sound and old folks with reduced high end pickup.  Low end response very good ....much better than std. speakers.  Ear muffs should cup the ear more like Bose head sets for better rejection of outside noise.
R3GJQZLHUTL7OJ,5,"It's a perfect device and works perfectly well.  I don't have any complain about it. I use it every day when I watch TV, and allow me to understand what I listen better than before"
R3QR7B31NVHONM,4,"I'm happy with my purchase. The reason for only four stars is that nothing is ever perfect. The only remark I have is that the headphones would not work when plugged into the audio out jack on the TV. They work GREAT when I moved them to the audio out jack on the Dish Network DVR. No crackling, pops, hiss or anything and I'm 20-25 feet away from the charging base.  For those of you who want the best of both worlds, (and be able to use the headphones AND hear from the TV at the same time), simply get two splitters from your local electronics store and plug them in to your audio out jacks (white and red) on the DVR, then plug your audio cable to the TV into one and plug the cable to the charging base into the other one and wa-la. Now grandma can rock the earphones and listen loud... and the rest of the room can hear the TV at normal volume.   Using the splitters also allows you to leave the charging base plugged into the DVR so you dont have to keep swapping out the line between your TV and the charging base when you're the only one up late at night watching TV. Just mute the TV and put on the headphones. :)"
RYOD9EIVHNWSL,5,"After trying several sets of wireless TV earphones, these are the best. There is no static and you can walk around the house an hear perfectly. I highly recommend these."
REK2HXJLVX882,2,"Headphones are nice and comfortable, by the static is pretty bad. I tried moving the base and playing with the tuning, but the amount of static has not greatly improved. Would have rather got something else."
R1B4V9EO6X5AFC,5,"These wireless headphones are a wonderful! Now, I can watch TV at a normal sound level while my husband can watch and hear at a louder level. This is a well made product and the price is well below Boise headphones (which by the way they do not have wireless headphones)  I would highly recommend this headphone to anybody who has trouble hearing or those who love to listen to the TV at a high level."
R9XAAAY9ANH3Z,5,"I recently purchased the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones for my 9 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  The headphones work exactly as advertised.  The sound is great, the phones are comfortable to wear, and the wireless convenience is best of all.  She can play her music withour disturbing anyone else and wander around the house while doing so."
R1UT24TBYSCZKE,3,"I thought these would be graet for late night tv listening but after about 35 min. I found them uncomfortable and could not find a way to make them more comfortable so I sent them back. Once or twice I did experience the popping sound others talked about. Maybe if I were younger I'd put up with the discomfort 70 yrs), the sound quality was good."
R26OCUVD9ENCPP,4,"My brother has been using this same make and model for over a year now and highly recommended it to me.  He researches products thoroughly before buying and so do I.  This one seemed to be the best one for the price and it proved to be true.  I use it every night watching TV in bed so as not to disturb my wife's reading or sleep.  The sound is exceptionally clear.  The only complaint I have is that it falls off my head very easily when I get up and and bend forward.  If not for this, I would give it five stars."
RNHBWIVVZD8SN,5,"I have really been liking these. I am a bit hard of hearing. I drive commercially and almost always have to have a hearing screening done to pass a DOT physical. I don't need hearing aids yet but keep getting closer to needing them to keep my CDL.  My wife will often need to go to bed before I do and I need the volume up so loud that it will keep her awake, because the TV is below our bedroom. So in the past I have had to turn on the closed captioning and \\""read\\"" the TV instead of listen to it.  So this was the solution I chose over a few different things I considered. Mainly I shopped by using Amazon to read reviews and decide on the price point I wanted to be at. I could maybe decide to move upscale later on, but right now I really like these.   Odd thing is, if I set the volume where I want it, then have my wife listen to the headphones (she has excellent hearing), she doesn't think I have it all that loud. So there seems to be some benefit to this, I don't know if it reduces what little ambient noise there is in the room or what. Although I do get a bit isolated, she has to nudge me to ask a question or otherwise talk to me, although I can still hear the phone or door bell ring for example.  So I am glad I got these. I can walk up to our kitchen and still receive the TV audio, which is cool.  Only thing critical is they don't seem to hug my head tightly enough (will slip forward if I lean forward for example), but on the flip side they are way comfortable, I guess for the same reason that they slip forward, they don't squeeze so tight that they are uncomfortable. Charging station is just great, lay them on the wire cradle and that's what connect them to the charger, totally effortless, just make sure the red \\""charge\\"" light come on, pretty hard to do it wrong. Connection was a snap, the charger and one wire to get the signal into it. I used our cable box for the signal so I can listen to one of the digital music channels if I want to without even having the TV on,there are some really great commercial-free music channels I can listen to on these now, although I haven't done it yet."
RJ2AUESIMCRAA,4,"Pros:  Very good sound, crisp voices, and nice bass without being overbearing or annoying.  Pretty good distance capabilities, can go outside, maybe 30 ft from transmitter and get clear sound with only occasional and brief crackle.  Decent styling looks fine in living room, and charges up nicely.   Cons: Tune wheel is next to volume, so you end up occasionally detuning instead of changing volume.  Should've but the tune on the other ear near the power switch. They also should have put the volume wheel on the underside of the ear piece, which would seem more natural for your thumb to assess..    Lastly, the fit is such that the cross-peice (over your head) seems to lie more toward your forehead.  This causes the headphones to tend to slip off if you tip your head forward, meaning they're not so great for doing work around the house while wearing. This also makes the back of the earphones to feel a little loose towards the back of your ear, though I have a feeling this is the \\""comfort-fit\\"" feature.  Unfortunately \\""comfort\\"" feels a whole lot like \\""loose\\"".  Overall, pretty happy with them, they do what they should, provide very good sound wirelessly."
RG5YVMPHF6X4X,4,"I have had trouble finding a good pair of headphones that will help with my failing hearing.  The sound quality and weight of these is perfect and I enjoy hearing every word now.  My only complaint is that the headband is too loose and cannot be adjusted.  When I lean my head forward they fall off my head which is a real problem.  Most other headphones have a tension adjustment that gives a level of grip to the head,  I wish these did.  Overcoming that design flaw would make these headphones nearly perfect."
R2BKPUFWK89TMB,5,"I was looking for some RF wireless headphones for my sister who lives in an assisted living environment. The phones were delivered within a few days, well in time for Christmas, and work like a charm!"
R30A3LHTZYLTOE,5,This is the second Sennheiser that we have purchased.  We have been extremely satisfied with the first one and decided to buy another one.  I use one of them when I am on the treadmill.  The only way I could hear the television over the background noise of the treadmill (without the headset) was to turn the volume up super loud (which would have woken up my wife). We have used the first one for about three years.  We purchased the second one for Christmas.  We have two televisions within earshot of each other.  Now my wife can watch her programs without the annoying background noise from the other one.  Great product.  Great price. Easy to install.  Would recommend.  Craig
R2TVZRE2YX1XTR,2,"Initially, I was very pleased with the headphones, using them primarily for playing Skyrim. The background \\""hiss\\"" mentioned by others is pretty noticeable, but I could live with it since the headphones sounded good otherwise and were quite comfortable.  The deal-killer was the auto-shutoff feature.  At least once an hour, the headphones would shut off when the sound level in the game was quiet, causing an almost painful burst of static noise that continued until the computer audio cable was disconnected and reconnected.  It's unfortunate the feature can't be disabled.  I ended up returning them."
R1GSE2JQWKB4ZS,2,"This product works alright... my biggest gripe (and it is becoming a BIG one) is that it gets interference at random angles, no matter what I do...  Cons: Fuzzy squealing sound that I can't make stop! I sit at a desk while I use these headphones, and looking very slightly (even an inch( in any direction often sends a fuzzy \\""squeal\\"" out. Sometimes, I feel like I haven't moved at all and the interference creeps in and squeals. It is very annoying. Also, the headphones themselves are quite large.  Pros: Range is good. Charging cradle is very convenient. Buttons are workable. Price is low.  Bottom line: The fuzzy interference that comes with any sort of movement is a deal-breaker. Yeah, it's cheap, but still not worth it. I would tell a friend to steer clear of this product and invest in something with a better, more consistent sound."
R3PWV201F15ATC,4,"I received these for Christmas, and so far I like them a lot.  My biggest problem these days is that most TV and movies play the background music too loud and the dialogue too soft.  Or -- due to my fading hearing, I must jack up the volume to hear what is being said.  This headset eliminates that problem, and I can hear sound again like I did 40 years ago.<br /><br />Set-up was simple -- just plug into the sound output on your device, plug in the charger, charge the headset for 24hrs, and you are good to go.  There is a red LED light that tells you the unit is charging the headset, but I found that it did not work unless I retracted the earpieces all the way back in before hanging them on the charger.  Sound is good from anywhere in my house, but I don't wear them when I get up as they tend to slide off my head when I look down.  I hear no hiss, and the volume is completely adjustable.  My TV will operate normally if my wife wants to sit in, and she finally has the remote completely back in her control, since I adjust my sound on the headset.  After about three hours they can become a tad warm on my ears (from my own body heat), so I don't use them for extended periods.<br /><br />This is a good wireless headset, and there is no interference with my home WI-Fi network (unlike my portable phone which knocks it out every time it rings).  I wish they were a little less bulky, but that is my only complaint so far."
R19KMQSVXYBO0Q,1,Static is unbearable.  Goes from bad tss tss tss tss to worst CHSHHSHSHSHSHSHSHSSHHSHS.  Yay! This will be my first return with amazon.
R3N4EKPBKEIZZO,5,"I have owned these now for almost two years and they are still working well.  They get daily use of 2 hours on average and show no signs of wear.  I have used them upwards of 6 hours straight without issue.<br /><br />Hiss: Incorrectly tuned on my part.  After some fine tuning, I have no more Hiss.<br />Distance:  Still Great.<br />Comfort: Better.  Either the ear pads have soften from use or my ears now have calluses. :-)<br />Clipping:  The clipping happens after several minutes of no audio connection.  Example is if I turn off the TV and leave the headphones on.  Still I am aware this will happen and adjust for it.  **IMPORTANT** It Does Not Do This While Watching TV/DVD/Streaming.  ONLY if NO Audio is Played for Several Minutes.<br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***<br />I read many of the positive and negative reviews before purchasing this product and wanted to address some of the negatives.  I've based my review knowing I purchased an entry to mid level product (on sale) and not the most expensive available.  I use these primarily for TV/DVD/Streaming.<br /><br />Hiss:  There is a hiss when no sound is being supplied to the headphones, but I find it is only during long silences between the primary show and commercials or during the blocked commercials while streaming.  It is not loud and I expected it from the reviews.  It is an acceptable and non-obtrusive hiss.<br /><br />Distance:  I have no troubles walking anywhere in my house (two stories) and find no diminishing of the quality of sound.<br /><br />Comfort:  They are comfortable and light weight.  I do find after an hour or more you can feel them against your ears more and it can be slightly distracting.  However, considering the convience of being able to watch a movie loudly without disturbing the household, it is a small price to pay.<br /><br />Clipping:  I haven't tried to determine why they do this, but at some point it does occasionally make a clipping noise.  It is slightly annoying, but not soloud as to injure.  IMPORTANT- it doesn't do this during the show.  Only during dead space.<br /><br />Base:  Easy to set up and easy to use.  No problems.<br /><br />This is all I currently have.  I have only had these for two weeks, but use them regularly.  I would recommend purchasing one at the reduced price.  Don't know if I would pay retail for them. I am considering a second one.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
R1CFPR72SS68EU,5,Works great can walk all over the house without loosing sound and is awesome for watching tv just like having surround sound. The head phones have great bass and a good sound would for sure recommend them.
R2IDSE3YQRHQAY,1,Got this for my girlfriend for christmas.  When she opened it it didn't have a Power Cable.  I am very unhappy about that.  How can you ship something without a power cable?
R128F68RQENDP9,5,"I am an old man 82 years,  my hearing is bad,  I ran across these headphones, I read some of the negitive reviews.  I understand that Sennheiser is a good company and would not market a bad product.  The bad reviews must come from people unable to understand the instructions.<br /><br />I received the headphones today and I must say I was impressed.  I can hear the TV perfectly.  I packed up my \\""TV EARS\\"" in favor of these wonderful headphones.  I have a clear signal, no distoration, no whistles, no background noise.  I feel that someone with my problems should most definatly buy these headphones"
R86NME8KNJO73,5,"Not too heavy, not too hot.  I did have to tune them in and you're well advised to get a \\""fanout\\"" connector so that you can listen to anything plugged into your stereo without having to plug and unplug the connectors.  The sound replication is as good as you can expect for headphones in this price range, and you won't be tripping over (these) cords."
R2OW7PLTJOIDUT,4,"I don't want to give these headsets a low rating, but I don't know what the problem was. They arrived within a few days of ordering them, so that was nice. They were really nice and comforitable, but they were all static and we could hardly hear the TV. I don't know if it is because we live in a Condo or not. I was really bummed they didn't work. We will probably have to get some that plug into the TV and see if that works. Overall they were super nice, just not sure if they worked."
R36ZFXHQ91P586,1,"This is a shame. I bought these because of so many good reviews. They are light weight, the audio quality is good, but none of that matters because I can't get a clean signal anywhere.<br /><br />I tried 3 different outlets, 2 which were directly into the wall. At best I get one channel of music and the other \\""channel\\"" of hiss. When I get actual sound (music) in both sides (by adjusting the tune control), it's only one channel, not stereo. They are also not even, either (one side isn't as loud as the other.) In addition, they buzz through my amp which is where I really wanted them. I also tried again the next day in yet another outlet and audio system and the same thing happened.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad pair, but these are completely useless to me and am sending them back."
R2NLPBJ677O4GY,2,Purchased because of posotive reviews. Hooked it up and have been constantly dissapointed. CONSTANT INTERFERENCE. I quute literally cannot get it to operate with hissing or popping or whining. Tried everything from changing the frequency its operating on to moving the transmitter. Dissapointed
R2UT3TDERCVL1I,5,"Pros:  Inexpensive  Great Sound Quality  Long Range  Generic Rechargeable Batteries  3 Channels Allow You To Avoid Interference  Cons:  Some clicking noise while moving, especially when rotating head or when far from base station but no noise when relatively close (~10 Meters) even when moving.  Notes:  These are great headphones.  I'm 6' 5\\"" tall (so big head) and they fit very comfortably.  They are light weight and feel nice on my ears even after wearing them all day (I'm a Software Engineer and listen to music for most of the day).  The fact that the rechargeable batteries are AAA and not a battery pack is nice because you can replace them if the battery life starts to fade.  The clicking noise when moving is not a problem at all for normal use.  You only notice it when far away and moving.  I was able to get great reception to about 25 meters and acceptable reception to about 75 meters through 2 walls.  Selectable channels allow you to avoid interference or other of the same headsets.  I am no audiophile but I am very pleased with the sound quality.  I usually use the ear buds that came with my mp3 player or cheap $30 headphones.  These beat them by a long shot for sound quality.  I did not notice any hissing sound unless I did not have anything playing and had the headphone volume turned up fairly high.  Final Thoughts:  Great product.  I may buy another pair for use at home.  -Sammy_K"
R3AV0GSRXNTNH4,5,"My dad has hearing disability due to old age.  So, I brought this for him so that he can watch tv without disturbing neighbors.  He is crazily in love with it, claiming it's first time for him to hear music in years (he wears hearing aid btw).  So, I brought two more for my grandparents and they also love these.  Now, my dad is asking me to buy 2 more for him.  This is gonna be the 5th one I purchased on Amazon in 12 months period.  That's just insane!"
R37XH4A3F6VO2S,5,These headphones are GREAT they have good range and sound great the only issue is that the headphones are large so if you have a small head they might be a little big for you.  Just remember to plug in the base unit into a power outlet
ROINW06W5WHLB,4,"I have tried a few Wireless (RF) Headphones for viewing and listening to TV while my wife is sleeping.  I have tried some budget products as well as high-end ones. The Sennheiser RS120 is the only one I have decided to keep.  The charging cradle is convenient, the audio quality is quite good, and the setup was quite easy.  And, the price isn't that much more than some of the budget items on the market.  On other models, the tuning feature could be painful and inconsistent.  Each night, I would have to re-tune the headset with the base which was quite annoying.  The RS120 was fairly easy and I don't lose the setting from night-to-night.  Only thing preventing me from giving it full 5 stars is the noise leaking from the headphones.  My wife is quite sensitive so I have to keep the volume low so as not to disturb her.  Better sound insulation would make this a 5-star product."
R2CKDMT6JA2RE5,4,I bought these headphones as a gift for my mother so she could listen to the TV with out turning up the volume at night.They fit a little snug on my head but I think they are wearing in a little so it's not too bad.If you have a smaller head they fit just fine like my mothers.They don't have ear cups like regular headphones but they do sit on top of your ears and conform somewhat.It just takes a little while to get used to the feeling.They feel like they will fall off at times but they are snug.The sound is pretty good for FM reception.You can walk like 50 to 100 feet away and still pick up the signal indoors.The box says 300 feet outdoors but I didn't try it.I'm sure they go close to it.The headphones have a tuning button on them to tune into the channel you want.All so the transmitter has 3 channel settings so you can find one that works best for you.It's not hard to tune in just keep turning the knob till you get a good signal on the headphones.Sometimes you can pickup up CB radios and phone calls if they are close by but only if you un tune the headphones from the transmitter till you hear static.It's kind of funny to hear people talking on the phone and the CB but it is only when you un tune the headphones otherwise it's not a problem at all.The sound is clear.Putting the headphones on the charger is easy too they just slid right into place and line up with the metal bar in the headphones.You may have to shorten the headphones when you put them back on the charger because the instructions say not to hold open the headphones or put them on a glass dummy head because they can lose there snug fit over time.It's not a problem if you remember to do this.You can also hang the charger on the wall.It has a hole in back for a nail or some other hook to hang it up with.The cord for the power and sound connectors is long too about 5 to six feet more or less so you should have no problem placing the transmitter anywhere to get better reception.It can hook up to a radio with the included adapter or hook up to a mp3 player or what ever takes that kind of plug.The charger cradle is sturdy and has rubber feet on it so it doesn't tip over or move when you place the headphones back on to charge.The box they come in is easy to open and is well packed with 2 sets of air bags.Over all I like them and recommend them to any one.
R1DVQH5S2OWGG7,1,"I wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews.  These do not work, after a few minutes the base disconnects and the static blasts.  These are a waste of money.  I wish I had tried them out immediately and returned them."
R1F8QJB5UX4UFE,1,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas and at first he liked them, although he said the sound quality wasn't that great.  He had high hopes and really liked the charging dock, but as he wore them doing chores around the house, he found that they didn't fit well and fell off easily due to the flatness of the headphone pads.  The third time he wore them, the on/off button broke.  Compared to the Radio Shack headphones that we had for 5 years, these were horrible.  Their sound was superior and the only reason we replaced them was because the headphone cover would no longer stay on.  I guess I'm going back to Radio Shack."
R3NTTJY9B5I7AC,4,"In this world of never-ending technology it is hard to keep up with what works with what. Such was the case with the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones which I recently purchased. They were intended to provide private listening to my new LG HDTV. Unfortunately, that was NOT to be the case for me.<br />My new digital TV does have the usual RCA, HDMI, & DMI connections on the back, but not a headphone jack. The Sennheiser comes with the two-wire cord fastened to the transmitter. This cord ends with the standard red and black (not white) RCA-style connectors, but also provide RCA to Phone Jack adapters. This allows you to connect the transmitter to either the Left/Right RCA Audio Out connection on the back of your TV, or plug it into the headphone jack on TV, Computer, etc.<br />What I did not know was that the RCA connectors on my TV are Audio In, not Audio Out (they say only AUDIO). Therefore, when the headphones were connected, they did not work because they were receiving no signal. But, when plugged into the headphone jack of my computer, they worked fine so I knew the headphone and transmitter were OK.<br />After contacting LG, they said my TV had only an Optical Audio Out connection. In order to use the headphones, I would need to purchase an Optical to RCA adapter, about $25-$50 dollars here at Amazon. And, unless you get even more expensive adapters ($80+), your Optical to RCA converter will not work if you have Dolby surround sound active. To get the cheaper adapters to work, you must first turn off the Dolby.<br />My caution is this: Before buying the Sennheiser headphones, check your TV to make sure the RCA plugs (two of them, one red and one white marked with an R (right) and a L(left) on the rear of your TV is Audio Out.<br />Or, that your TV has a headphone jack.<br />If you first read the forum here regarding these headphones (which I didn't), you will see this is pretty common problem.<br />I will give the headphones four stars because they seem to work quite well with my computer, but not with my TV. Now I'm a bit shy of getting an adapter because there is no way of knowing whether it will give satisfactory sound since I do have Dolby sound on my TV. Round and round it goes...puter, but not with my TV. Now I'm a bit shy of getting an adapter because there is no way of knowing whether it will give satisfactory sound since I do have Dolby sound on my TV. Round and round it goes..."
R2Y5KYVIHRTZ7J,4,"I've got a brand new Samsung 51-inch Plasma (or LED, can't remember, but I think it's plasma) HDTV. It's insanely nice but has a limited amount of inputs. So then I go and buy these headphones which come with what I thought were the RCA or VGA (?) plugs, the white and red ones... but in reality it's a red and a black. So I attempted to plug these into the audio inputs of the component input holes: No success.   I have a small TV in the kitchen, a little Vizio which has an insane amount of inputs. It actually has a headphone plug. The headphones come with a RCA (VGA?) to headphone jack attachment. I plugged that up and hooked it up to the little TV's headphone input and the headphones worked perfectly. So I know they work and the sound was very nice.  However, I got these for my big TV and now I have no idea how to hook them up to it. My big TV has 2 HDMI, 1 USB, 1 component input, and some other funky ones that I've never come across, I mean some real weird looking hole thingies. Anybody have a clue how to hook up these headphones to such a limited-input hole option television?"
R312XYE0GUTB72,5,"I don't hear to well anymore and my wife and I don't always agree on how high the volume is set on the TV.  If the dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer are running I really need the volume turned up.  These are the answer.  They block the sounds from the mentioned machines and bring the volume to my ears just perfect.  I don't hear any stattic noises as described by other reviews.  They could be smaller, lighter, or more comfortable, but they are good enough just the way they are."
R10R56VTS3NK52,5,"This was a replacement for my father's old wireless headphones.  He is hard of hearing, and doesn't want to annoy anyone with the TV turned-up too loud, so he uses wireless headphones a lot.  These Sennheiser headphones are several levels above what he has used in the past, the sound and build quality are excellent.  He can walk from his bedroom, to the kitchen, even to the curb to take the trash out without losing the audio from his bedroom.  Static does come through when he is about 60ft away from his room, but it is not that bad, and to be fair, he hasn't bothered to try another channel to see if there is better reception.  There are 3 different channels (or frequency ranges) that you can select from.  The charging cradle makes all the different in the world!  My father used to use rechargeable batteries in his other headphones, but it was still annoying to have to replace them every other day.  With these, he just places them on the charging cradle, and they are ready to go the next time he wants to watch TV."
R2UOTZZW68WL5Q,5,"Before getting these headphones, I was always on edge, hearing the TV as my husband watched from his recliner.  He was on edge, because I was banging around in the kitchen, distracting him from his FOX news.  He would turn the TV louder, which stressed me more.  If the grandchildren came for a visit, we would make noise doing crafts or playing games in the kitchen (open to the great room), and we would irritate my husband, who was trying to hear the TV.  Once again, he would turn it up louder, then the grandkids would talk louder....a vicious, noisy cycle.  Now we are all happy and can share the space without annoying one another.  We plan to buy another set for our RV! Our greatroom ceiling is high and the sound is bad in the room.  Sometimes I use the headset in the morning so I can listen to my favorite morning shows while doing houseowrk.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br /> We bought these in December 2011 and they are still going strong!  The only problem I have is that I have a small head and I can't bend over without the headset falling off.<br /><br />BTW:  Walking around the house is ok, but they get a little static at more than 30 feet."
R139EOFV3LJNMQ,5,"I bought these for my 102 year old Mother who has trouble hearing the television.  After reading the reviews for the Sennheiser RS120, I decided to buy them for her.  They are wonderful!!  Mom can hear the television now and she can work the on/off controls and volume setting with no problem.  Since she is in an assisted living center, it was not practical to turn the TV up so much because it would disturb other residents.  The sound quality is so much better than I anticipated, given the price.  I'm telling everyone about these headphones."
R3AGC4QD0Z7OJU,5,"I live in a complex with very noisy neighbors and it made it hard to enjoy watching TV. The headphones totally drown out external noise and allow me to watch in peace. Plus, they work in other rooms so I can listen to the news and favorite shows while doing chores or while on the computer and know when I need to pop back in the living room to see something. Very happy with these headphones!"
R30UYMH5GTX0HU,3,"I own a number of pairs of Sennheiser headphones, most of them in the $20-$50 range. When I purchased these $100+ headphones from them I expected to be blown away with the quality. Instead, they sound and feel worse than the cheaper wired pairs I already own. They are not horrible, and I do want a pair of wireless headphones, so I'll be keeping them, but I would say these headphones are just \\""OK\\""."
R9SN90W4ZULKP,4,"Bought these because I work 3rd shift. My wife can use them when I'm asleep. Easy to setup and adjust. Only problem I have is they are sooooo sensitive. I have to adjust tuning dial too often if I move to the left or right of where I'm sitting. That's my only issue. I watch TV, DVDs, and play video games and everything sounds great. Great product for the price."
RN2SDSIHMQEU1,2,"I recently hooked them up and tried the headphones out and everything seems to be working fine.  The only downside to the headphones is that if I move my head around a lot, the headphones slide around on my head.  The headphones are also big, not any bigger than any of the competition, but I think it would be nice to have headphone options that are smaller, but I don't know if that is possible.  Since they are big they push my hair down so I get headphone hair (similar to hat hair).  Outside of that, everything works well.  One bonus over other similar headphones that I have is that these came with their own rechargeable batteries, so no extra expenses!  UPDATE: These stopped working after about a year and a half.  I still have them hoping that someday I'll plug them into a different device and it will work again, but it hasn't happened yet.  :-(  Probably need to go in the trash. I have some headphones I bought from Radio Shack that are Radio Shack Brand that have been working great for over 5 years.  Should have bought another Radio Shack set vs. these."
R2I1QBEN8VVN0S,5,"Got this for my sister who can't hear the mumbling that often occurs on TV programs. She doesn't have to say \\""What did he say?\\"" anymore and her husband call still listen without headphones.  Easy.  Just charge, plug into audio out and you're set. Good quality for the price."
R37P3G88ZQA43T,4,"Before buy these Headphones check if your TV has a mini jack headphones Output or a Stereo Analog Output.<br />My TV (37'' Vizio 1080p) just has an Digital Audio Output, so I had to buy a Converter Box:<br />[[ASIN:B005K2TXMO FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC]] (this one came with the cable)<br />Now works perfect, good sound and reception."
R26PMNEW2QYZUG,4,"I bought these to replace some RCA earphones that cupped over the ear.  I read reviews which gave high marks for the sound quality of the Sennheiser.  I am not disappointed, but I liked the RCA pair better.  The Sennheiser is hard and flat against the ear. The sound leaks a litte more (don't want to bother my wife while I watch TV in the bedroom).  The sound quality is not better than the RCA and (subjectively) a little less.  I do prefer the stand and ease of recharging, however.  I think I bought the RCA pair at Radio Shack years ago.  I found them online somewhere, and the price was less;  but the reviews were not as positive as the Sennheiser. I wish I had stayed with RCA."
R7WHLB2Z12PJG,4,"Just bought these for myself - and am really pleased.  Read all the reviews and people complaining about \\""hissing\\"", but it's really nothing.  Not noticeable at all unless you have long moments of utter silence, and you have the volume up really loud.  Overall some great headphones.    Only thing that I find weird is the headphone shape itself - it angles outward and so doesn't fit as comfortably as others I've worn, but it's just a matter of getting used to it I guess."
R1MVWVEQRVC9R1,5,I did a lot of research to find the right product. I like to watch TV in bed before I go to sleep and the TV bothers my husband. Now we can watch together and when he rolls over I just hit the mute button on the remote and put on the headset. Sound quality is perfect and they are comfortable to wear.
R3ID702U3CMBQK,4,This is a great set of headphones. It has wonderful clarity and depth to whatever is on tv. Love it to watch NHL. Its worth every penny.
R171KKBS7DPZBL,5,"My wife is hard of hearing, this product enabled her to hear TV,  It also has great sound! For the price a Great product!"
R24328SJLNGH6X,1,This product did not work at all. All I heard was white noises or nothing at all. I had to return it. This is the first time I had  to return a merchandise back that I have purchased from amazon.
R1T0SSRXJGU7Q6,3,"(This original review has changed. See below) I could not get these to work with my sound system which has plug for headphones. They will not work. They also would not work on the jack on back of t.v. So thanks to comment by PriVick, I tried unplugging my sound system and using audio out on cable box and they worked. But now can't use my sound system. T.V. speakers on the LG flat screen are really bad. You have to turn up volume 100% to even hear the t.v. So now if we want to use the headphones, we have to settle for everyone else listening to t.v. speakers without surround sound system. Its not an ideal solution. Its only for the kitchen t.v. so I guess I'll keep them but will look elsewhere for our entertainment room t.v.<br /><br />Edit -<br />I changed my original review after someone commented on my review which gave me instruction on how to get them to work. I now can give 3 stars because they work well and good quality sound. The instructions could be far better however. If you're technologically challenged when it comes to setting up such things and what things are called and what wire/plug should go where, then you will be lost with these instructions! If instructions were better, I'd give 4 stars."
R2RMDZY2FSFPKW,5,Best headphones we've had. Stereo sound is amazing (took some getting used to  after several years use of our old 'phones). Excellent price and early delivery.
R22RYALWS9X7R3,1,"I knew I was taking a chance ordering these headphones, as other reviewers had mentioned that they are wide and they still had problems with hissing / clicking sounds. Well I had both of those problems as well. The headphones are very wide -- they feel way too loose and when I bent over for any reason (I wear them while cleaning / doing laundry, so I bend a lot), they promptly fell off of my head. Terrible -- don't know why they're not adjustable that way. Even if so, I'd still be unhappy with the reception -- our home is 2600 sq ft, and I had lots of areas inside where there was hiss and clicking noises. Oh well. I never would have known unless I tried...."
R1BKBSPECTVW07,2,"I have no idea how these phones get such a high user rating. They have absolutely no bass whatsoever, and the volume distortion breaking point is only about half way. So no volume either, unless you like the clicking and twitching sound of over burdened speakers. I tried a variety of music styles and formats, along with various types of players. I also used both the headphone jack and the RCA direct line-outs. The RCA lines sounded *slightly* cleaner, but not much. Also, they are NOT AT ALL Silent to the people around you.    I must add that I did not have any interference, humming or static that other people were persistently complaining about. The volume and tuning knob locations don't bother me either. Build quality is as good as anything else coming out of China these days, not good, not bad. They are comfortable, and the charging system is well designed and effortless to use.  All in all, the sound is the most important feature. Unfortunately they fail miserably."
R30NA8L2XL43FC,1,The unit had inadequate instructions and did not work due apparently to internal defects. Do not waste your money on this one
R1LMH0MHF45VVF,5,"Excellent sound, I can hear a much more compete sound than from the TV's speakers. Of course whether you only hear sound from your head phone or from both the TV and the head phone depends on what features your TV provides."
R3IMZ9F2CDTV67,4,The wife and I are very pleased with the headphones. She likes to listen to the TV a bit loud and when I am in the other room - it annoys me. Problem solved and the sound is so much better than my Flat Panel Screen TV. You want be sorry. Don't worry - it recharges itself. I did much research before buying. Amazon had the right price and free shipping. Hope this helps.
R2BKA63Q20XG98,5,"these headphones are AWESOME. I work nights, my roommate days.. wonderful to be able to watch a movie/TV and HEAR IT.. great quality. (you can even hear the 'peepers' in the background very clearly). I recommend this to everyone"
R38UEMF83XXZJJ,4,"I have been pleasantly surprized by the sound quality of these headphones, clear sound, and deep base!  I have used these for music by hooking up to my laptop, as well as for watching tv and movies by hooking up to my tv.  Only drawback is that they don't fit very snugly, good for sitting still, but I think if I was doing chores and walking around the house they probably wouldn't stay on very well."
R23I4JM5RQ3URV,5,"My husband was unable to hear the tv at all unless it was full blast...I ordered the Sennheiser RS 120  because of the reviews given on Amazon.  The headphones are GREAT! Easy to set up. Rechargeable in the   holder. My husband and I can watch a movie together and he can hear every word, and background noise and  music, whispers, all the sound... I highly recommend them CG"
R37CJ0VCN4D966,2,"Whoever is thinking about buying these, be warned! These headphones are no good. Do not spend your money on them. I had them for less than 1 day, and already thay had that real bad fuzzy sound, and I was less than a foot away from the antana thing. Also, these headphones interfere with the telephone line, so in other words if you are listening to some music and somebody is on the phone, then they can hear what you are hearing. The onliest thing I found good about these things were that the earpieces were really soft. I hope my review helps somebody out in deciding whether or not to buy them or not."
R15IBM6CT0ZQVI,5,I hooked these up to the TV for my dad to use.  He is a little hard of hearing and always cranks the volume on the TV. Now with these he can watch TV without drowning out the rest of the house.  I have used them as well and the sound is excellent and kept workgin even when I walked up to the second story of our house.  My only gripe is the tune and vol dials are too close together and can easily be confused while you are wearing the headsets.
R2GUNXR8D9GOW4,1,"Bought this product in February 28, 2011 and as of today it is already unfunctional due to a major ( at least to me) safety issue. Was wearing the headset yesterday and working fine, then all of a sudden smelt a bad odor kind like something in the room was shorting out and came to find that inside the earpiece where the batteries are it smoked the unit. Opened it up and battery housing area was blackened and confirmed the unit toasted itself. No heat or injury to me but now I have a dead product and both Amazon and 17th St Photo won't replace the unit. Claim no one-year guarentee even on product defect like this. Usually like Amazon's sub contracted vendors but will now be very cautious, and avoid Amazon whenever necessary as I like good service over good prices. What a way to end a long and mostly good business relationship. Happy New Year."
R3VOCVQRJG4WJU,4,"I had been looking for a wireless alternative to my speakers connected to my pc, to avoid wasting my time wearing it on and off every time I give a break. I decided on wireless headphones over bluetooth earphones for comfort, durability and higher sound quality. I preferred this particular model over the advanced ones (RS130-170); because there is a HUGE price gap inbetween ($50 to over $150). Here are my reflections on RS120:  PROS  -Sound quality: Sound is crisp and powerful, it is more than enough to satisfy your needs for everyday use.  -Battery life: I have not tested it thoroughly; but I was never out of battery after 5-6 hours of use.  -Charger/Transmitter: This is one of the aspects that I admired in this model. Transmitter acts as a charger, it makes your life A LOT easier when you wear on and off your headphones.  -Design: It looks really elegant on your table if you have black/grey color scheme in your PC setup.  -Comfort: I had 'barely noticeable' pain in my ears after hours of usage; but it is barely noticeable and not bothering me at all.  -Price: In 50 bucks range, price is unbeatable for what you get.  CONS  -Hissing: I had to play really carefully with transmission channel settings to get a sound with tolerable interference. Still, there is a hissing in the background that you can notice when the volume is low. It is not intolerable, but it DOES exist as other reviewers also point out. I'm not sure if this is still an issue in more expensive models which use 2.4Ghz transmission.  -Range: In fact, the range is pretty good, I could even walk to my mailbox and still get the signal, but the quality with range decreases REALLY FAST. If you're intending to use it >10ft range you may be disappointed. I'm using it in my living room; hence this is not bothering me at all. Again, you may want to check out the range/sound quality trade-off in the expensive models if you're intending to go for something better.  -Auto turn-off: I've found this feature really annoying. If the transmitter keeps silent for 1-2 minutes it turns off, and you instantly hear a loud, annoying noise that can make you jump off your chair if you're at the max volume.  -Wall interference: The interference increases significantly when I switch rooms. If you're intending to use the headphones in a different room than the transmitter you may again be disappointed.  OVERALL  These speakers are worth the $50 you pay for. For everyday use it does its job and gives you the wireless freedom you need. However, interference can be annoying sometimes particularly in range and across the rooms. I recommend these headphones if you are planning to use it not-too-far-away from the transmitter. 4 out of 5 stars."
R3IXX3NXAL2FC5,5,"Excellent sound quality and amazing price. Would definitely recommend this product when comparing price v quality. Just be sure to read the directions carefully if you want to use the television (for others in the room) and the headphones at the same time... simple set up, but you will have to make adjustments to your television settings, NOT the headphones."
R1TYT3VCJV7IWJ,5,Absolutly love these headphones. I love to watch movies and most of them are movies that the wife hates and the kids cant watch. These headphones are excellent for watching during baby's nap time or late at night when everyone is sleeping. The sound quality is excellent and i find that the knobs for volume adjustment and tuning are very easy to find. The battery life is great and I have had no problems. I dont have the best hearing in the world but even I find that these will blow your ear drums if you like. I would recommend these for anyone. Very happy with my purchase.
RA1KLT3I5IQTE,1,"I would think twice before buying anything more from Sennheiser.  I am a gadget hound. I purchased their headsets and, frankly they worked great, for about 3 weeks before they stopped working.  I contacted the customer service organization, I sent them my headsets and base for repair, 4 weeks later, they sent me a brand new headset.  *** THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY NEVER RETURNED THE BASE ***.  I've contacted them 6 times so far.  One of the times they said they were going to return the base to me but they never responded after that (no base was sent).  It has now been close to 10 months... and multiple attempts to contact them... no replies... no base... wish I kept my money (plenty of other options out there.) I am writing this review after being kept on hold for 59 minutes on their customer service line."
R2CZRZB5I6II1Q,2,"These headphones are far overrated. After reading the reviews and seeing the markdown in price, I was sucked into purchasing them. The sound quality is poor, and the wireless reception is subject to interference at distances > 10 feet, no matter which channel you choose to transmit on. If you enjoy listening to music with no bass, and are just looking for a cheap pair of wireless headphones, then these are for you. I am disappointed."
R17AYB06ZM2J7P,5,"This product is great - I can listen to the TV with out every one else having to<br />endure it loud.  I also catch all the words, when a person on TV would whisper<br />I would never catch that and now I can hear it all!  Would recommend highly!"
R1CR2L15EULBIO,4,I read many complaints about these headphones and was about to return them in frustration (because I was unable to make them work) when my son-in-law tried plugging them into my radio where they did work. He then found my tv output needed to be adjusted! It was NOT the fault of the headphones after all. They are actually very good. Give them a chance! ro
R2EM1XLUHTYZGK,5,"Just turned them on last night. Stayed up listening to HD TV way past my bedtime as the sound was so fantastic!!! Still could hear normal room noises, phone, conversation, etc. LOVE THEM!! After some many \\""What did they say?\\"" they are a wonderful purchase. The only downside so far, I should have ordered them sooner!!"
R25BY4UYH7BS49,5,These are worth a look if you want to watch TV without disturbing anyone. Took a while to install but once it's hooked up I was surprised how clear they sound. I walked out to the mailbox which is about 100' away from the receiver and they didn't lose the sound. I should have bought a 2nd pair for the guest bedroom. Don't know how long the battery life is but other than that no problems with these!
R31A952ZZACML6,4,Product works well as advertised. Included adapter for standard headphone jack is large and does not fit some devices. However third party alternatives are very cheep (< 99 cents). Audio quality is not 100% perfect not for audiophiles however for me it works sounds great. Very occasional hiss / pop noise however may be due to interference I have not fiddled with the tuning much. Also will not charge unless both ear covers are set to the same length it does not balance on the cradle not really a big deal but kinda annoying if you have a weirdly shaped head.
R39LM6BIM4P3Z5,5,"you wont really find anything clearer for the price.  the wireless works as well as they claim in the description.  a bit lacking in bass on my laptop.  i use \\""bass boost\\"" on the equilizer within the program to get it up to a preferable level."
R1LVBPBAP85C7K,5,"one of the best 60 bucks I have ever spent, product packaging looks like what a quality product should be and did not disappointed me after opening it. it looks a little weird on my head because it is kinda wide. I can walk anywhere in my house behind two walls and a door and the sound is still clear. but it makes me wonder what kind of radio signal are going into my head."
R1B7CO6K0PIYCW,5,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband, so he can play games on the Xbox 360 and watch IV at bedtime without having to turn the sound off so that I can sleep.  He absolutely loves it- it is very comfortable and lightweight to wear and has an excellent sound quality even at the other end of the house.  He has worn it for hours daily since he opened the box 4 days ago, even when he doesn't need to limit the sound.  Well worth the money!"
R3CMX6O5Y28I66,5,"What do you buy young adults for Christmas?  These are an excellent choice.  My son has almost made these a regular part of his \\""in home\\"" wear.  He's able to walk all over the house with good reception.  His is connected to his laptop.  He listens to music and with his games.  The headphones are external sound dampening with the audio recieved clean.<br /><br />We couldn't be happier!"
RJT678L27PBY9,4,"Good product, well done. If it could be a little smaller, I would of love it even more.  This is the third Sennheiser headphone I bought."
R3P5JK6QVS9TQF,5,"I purchased my Sennheiser Headphones so that my wife could sleep, I could watch and hear Television. The sound reproduction is excellent, so good in fact that I bought two, one for the bedroom and one for the living room."
R1TLF6D4I7UCEA,5,Very happy with my purchase. Work perfectly with my Sony LCD HDTV as well as home theater. The quality is descent. Sometimes you can hear the humming other people have mentioned but does not bother me.
R9BVQVXCQQ31G,4,"If you are looking for some very decent wireless headphones at very decent price, look no further.  Pros: Very light and comfortable.    Very good battery life.    Good sound quality.  Cons: Sound could be better. Could use more bass."
R23KLPZ8H7UJXR,5,"If you rate these headphones on value for the dollar, these are as good as it gets. Nothing cheap looking, nothing is going to break easily; they produce not only good sound that you have been missing but there's intelligence built into the transmitter. When there's nothing to send, it turns itself off and then back on again when there is. The headphones charge magically as they sit on the cradle. No wires or contacts; the whole package is from the future.  Don't worry about the \\""hiss\\"" alluded to in the most popular critical review. You have to balance the volume coming out of the sound source with the headphone volume control. Turn either one up too much and like every other headphone in the world, you will eventually hear it. In other words, if you hear a hiss, back off on the volume of one and increase it on the other. Repeat until you achieve the volume you want.  Here's some tips: If you're using the headphones for TV listening connect the transmitter to your receiver box if you're only going want to listen to that output. This way TV mute will not affect your headphones and is the only way to hush your TV speakers. If you have something like Netflix you will want to connect to the TV instead. This way TV volume is disconnected and mute is for the headphones. If you have a stereo system connected to your TV or receiver box you will need to decide where to connect the transmitter to achieve the effect you desire. So you see, there are a good variety of things to consider when hooking up. One thing is for certain; when you get it all working, you will be one happy camper -- like me. :)"
R9PV006AIKMPF,5,"You can't beat these for the price, they really preform great. I will be buying a second set for my wife. I will also be looking at<br />other products from this company"
R1GCC99P7ATDAT,5,"These are so good. Sometimes the surround sound is so real that I sometimes think there is a noise in the next room but is actually on the program I am watching. So clear and really kind of wierd to be able to walk into another room or outside with these on. Never have had to worry about the length of use, usually fall asleep but they keep on going...,,,better product than I expected!!"
R3JSMSNOCOFLD9,5,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 headphones about a year ago for our main TV.  We liked them so much, we bought another set for the kitchen TV, and then we bought a third set for our TV in the exercise room in the basement.  We have three sets of headphones, and each headphone can tune to any one of the TV's.  I love it in the kitchen, because even if I am doing something noisy like frying or sauteeing, I can still hear the TV.  Also, since our kitchen and living room are nearby, we can use the headphones and not worry about sound transferring into the other room.    We bought a cradle and an extra set of headphones for my inlaws about six months ago -- my father-in-law is hard of hearing, and they absolutely love them.  My father, who is nearly deaf, is visiting me now, and he tried a headset with his hearing aids on, and he says he can hear the TV quite well, so I am now going to order one for him.  I have not noticed any hiss -- I can walk to several different rooms in the house and still hear the TV.  I can even go outside and grill.  The only thing you have to be careful about is the hookups to your audio source.  Some TV's do not come with audio-out (analog) RCA plugs -- these are the red/black or white/black plugs on the back.  If you have only an optical-out (digital) plug, you have to buy a digital-to-analog converter and a toslink cable, and the converter is expensive.  TV's also work differently with regard to the audio-out.  Some TV's will mute the audio-out when you mute the TV -- if you want to mute the speakers without muting the headphones, you have to go into the audio menu to do it.  The best setup is a TV that will mute the speakers without muting the audio-out connection.  Anyway, I highly recommend these headphones for this kind of use."
R2T2JYVRH8H9II,5,"I am so pleased with the earphones. I was having so much trouble hearing many tv programs; the music drowned out the voices, the actors seemed to be whispering at times. Now I can hear everything! I can't wear hearing aids, so these headphones are ideal for me. They were easy to hook up and I can hear even in the kitchen. Now the music sounds like background music, not the main course!"
R6ZX2OUTDS81O,5,Worked sweet right out of the box.  I just connected the cables to the audio out on my cable box and turned them on.  I didn't even have to tune them in.  Even better is when I hit the mute button on the remote it mutes the TV but the headphones stay on and control the volume from the headphones. They sound great as I can hear things I never heard from the TV speakers.  Only slight complaint is they fit a little snug for my big head but not a big deal.
R1RABKMC66O9SK,5,Very pleased with these headphones.  Plug and play straight from the box.  Plenty of volume in any normal sized room and still worked well through two interior walls.  The tuning is very sensitive and the signal can easily be lossed through any accidental alteration of the control but loud and clear when set correctly.  Recharging is easily set.  I am glad I bought them.
R39K9GOUWMPV2H,5,"I bought these as a gift for my dad who is always getting yelled at by the rest of the family for the TV volume.  I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews people had posted, but these work great!! A great set at a great price point!! They were an easy set up, and have been working perfectly since Christmas day.  The only \\""issues\\"" that have been reported are that the ear covers themselves aren't as comfy as they could be for long continual wear, but even that has been reported as a minor issue...Also a second set of headphones would be a good option so you have one charging and one being used.  My mom is happy, my dad is happy...the whole family is thrilled that the TV can be on and everyone else can have a conversation!!"
R15I0Q2SKXWU41,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 headphones are now something that I use daily. Amazingly enough, they even work through double-paned glass windows and doors so that I can listen to the television while out on my patio.   I could probably use them to listen to the radio while I mowed the lawn if I felt like it."
R25THAIM79L21M,2,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE HEADSET.  I WANTED TO USE THEM WHILE EXERCISING TO JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC AND DROWN OUT THE BACKGROUND NOISE.  THEY WOULD SLIP OFF MY HEAD, AND SSO I SENT THEM BACK."
R3FLDQH44V3GZL,3,"These headphones are OK, but not the most comfortable ones that I have had.  If I move about the room while listening, in the same room where the transmitter is located, I pass through places where the signal drops out.  OK for sitting and watching TV as I just need to move a short distance, but annoying if you want to move about the room while listening because you go through these signal nulls."
R2B1VSH87FKNXY,1,"Bought this for wife so volume on TV can be turned down.  Some of the reviews referred to a \\""hiss\\"", but the majority rated it okay - so I bought it.  Was a mistake.  The hiss is so overpowering you can barely make out anything.  Switched settings, etc., no luck.  Will be ruturning - hope get refund."
R1X5EC6YFDULHD,5,"These headphones have great sound, and are pretty comfortable to wear. The only thing is that they fit your head kind of loosely, so I wear a baseball cap with them and the problem is solved. Getting them to charge on the cradle can be a little tricky but not a big deal.  Overall they are very good for the price, and I plan on buying more matching headsets as I am using them to record music with a band. My band members have used them and also like them. They have great bass response and overall sound."
RNGN04QUAD6QU,5,"These are in fact the best RF headphone I have used in my life. They can handle large amounts of loud deep bass with no distorted bass sounds. I can walk 321FT away from the base transmitter before getting any static interference. I get up to 342FT away from the base transmitter and the signal will come in and out but can still understand what I am listening to. I loose all the signal at 348FT. This was tested outside vs a laptop plugged into a 240 volt 30 amp backup battery in a wide open area near the town Wakita in Oklahoma. I used a tool for measuring great long distances. When I came back home in Kent, WA I tried them out and was able to walk around the entire mobile home with out hearing in static at all. When I tested it in my front yard with the same laptop setup I was only able to get up to 162 before loosing the audio signal completely. I just can't get the same distance in Kent, Washington as I was able to get near Wakita in Oklahoma."
R8WG7BZSDY5TO,5,I recieved this unit as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love them. The tv itself can be muted but I will have perfect sound through my headset. My old set was flimsy and had a very low range of reception but I am able to walk all around the house with uninterupted reception. Actually the only thing bad I can say about this unit is that the headset is a bit on the wide side. I have a bigger head and they fit rather loose on me but are manageable when sitting still watching tv. They are also very comfortable to wear. More so than the flimsy ones that are twice the price. Much better sound too.
R1YIEPTF9Z4AXH,3,The headphone slides away and is to loose. There are no adjustments.  Otherwise the sound quality is good and no functional issues.
R2ENQF3MX3R7KF,4,"I purchased two pair, one for my wife and one for me. Use them only for TV and the sound great.Only problem is if you turn your head in one certain way you get some static.I fixed that by moving the base unit."
RJJBSLBQ768H8,3,The Sennheiser RS 120 has good audio quality and the range is fine.  This wireless phone works as advertised.  The only complaint is that they are not too comfortable to wear.  There is pressure on one's ears and I have to readjust them every 10 minutes or so.  The swivel earpieces do not seem to be well-designed and do not adapt (at least to me) to the coutours of my head.
R1TECCT88G2H0R,4,"These headphones were very easy to set up. The sound is wonderful - no notable hissing noise like others reviewed.  I use for TV and adjust the volume on the TV very low and turn the headphones up.  I also adjust the tuning dial on the headphone for clarity.  Works great!    One complaint is that with the adjustment for head size, even on the lowest position, the earphones fit loose.  Perhaps the issue could be fixed with different earphone pads, which would grip better.  These slide around on my head when walking around with them.  If I bend over, they may fall off.  I am an average size person - not petite.  They are also a little heavier than expected. I thought new headphones of this quality would fit nice and snug.  However, the sound is very good and I mostly sit when using them."
R1AP4OGNYV023C,2,"This unit came highly rated so I bought it unseen.  After hooking it up, the reception is horrible.  The volume and tune control are right next to each other so you constantly hit the wrong dial and have to re-tune it.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!  There is no reason this does not have digital tuning."
R2UUEX7Z6UYJ1,4,"I purchased the unit in late Nov., with no previous experience in this type of electronics. I had a small problem after hooking up the unit and called the Customer Service number and was asked how much would I pay to have my question answered by an expert. This bothered me.  I figured out my problem and I am happy to say that the unit performs as advertised. Tuning was easy, sounds are great, I have had no problems. Its nice to be able to watch TV in the evening where I can hear every word said and I am bothering no one.   The only suggestion I have is to increase the pading on the head set for people who wear glasses. With the head set on for a few hours, the ears start to hurt, where the glasses frame cuts into the ear."
R2SNZSYQZIACXK,5,"I ordered these as a gift for my wife for Christmas.  They were purchased with the idea to help her watch TV without the distractions from the kids, air conditioner, etc.  They were very easy to hook up with just 2 audio plugs plus the AC plug.  I had them working in about 3 minutes.  They work great.  They provide a very nice surround sound effect.  I was surprised at the amount of detail in the sound.  We could hear things in the headphone that we could not hear through our normal speaker system.  We did find that she had to adjust the \\""tune\\"" rotary switch a little to get them adjusted just right, but one they were adjusted, we have not touched it since.  She loves them.  She said they are comfortable and light.  She wears them out to the kitchen while watching TV even.  If you are looking for a good way to have wireless speakers or head phones, they are a great inexpensive option!"
R1KAHHOTQF7FN5,5,"as an older guy, I need amplification when watching TV without cracking the plaster.  despite some negative reviews about background and hissing noise, I am picking up clear reception from my connection to two different types of cable boxes.  the control adjustments on the phones and on the base provide excellent dialog and sound track reception.  great tool, great price from Amazon"
R13Z9UHHKQC5FI,4,"After having written several reviews panning some Amazon-promoted products, I'm pleased to give a positive response to this one.  After some research with many pros and cons noted, I decided to buy this wireless headset as a way to keep peace in the family over TV volume.  They work very well!  I've had them for several weeks and can find no fault as some have listed.  I had them on while watching a football game and had to go downstairs for a minute and the sound was the same at 50 ft. distance.  Good stuff!"
RDWVB2FUVMRSR,3,"Okay, so I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas because we haven't been able to watch TV together for the last few months, as he has to have it sooo loud, i was getting headaches. After following the set up instructions, I was having the problem of only static when connecting to the audio ports on the TV. I connected the transmittor to the Direct tv box, and it works perfectly! So nice not to have the TV blaring and he's happy he can hear the TV with no problem through the headset."
R2LYWOTQ8FBREA,4,"I read all the reviews but decided to take a chance anyway. Overall I am very happy with these headphones. I was looking for wireless headphones so I could watch my DVR recorded TV shows without bothering my wife. I do agree with some of the issues mentioned in other reviews, loose fit, popping, etc. but for my use they work just great. Sitting only 15 feet from the source I don't encounter any static, popping or fading issues. I haven't tried music with them so I can't speak to those issues. It was a great deal for some decent headphones."
R3JK8ZDKJDO8GL,5,"Have used these headphones for several months and all I can say is,\\""Great headphones, buy, and you will not be disappointed!!\\"""
R375G5SKO2HRNH,5,These headphones are as advertised.. Great.. Shipped as promised and am using them all the time.. Recommend highly...Have not experienced any of the complaints of some reviews..
R2DPQQ014VZ4KP,5,I can listen to the tv at MY volume without disturbing my wife.  Words are clearer and sound is great quality. Worth the extra  money over the cheaper products.
R3QFYL4YLQOOYR,5,"My grandma is hard of hearing and needed something to help her watch TV. She's not very tech-savvy, but she has no problem using these. And she says they really help her hear what's going on."
R2RR8OCMO0AVTZ,5,"Having researched wireless headphones on several sites I decided on the Sennheiser RS120.  I must say I am glad I did. These work great, easy set up just unpacked charged the batteries for 24 hr and turned them on and they are super.  The sound is clear and crisp.  The headphones are light and comfortable to wear.  I have a two story home and I am able to walk all over the house and get good reception.  I have not experienced any hissing sound or static in the headphones.  Bottom line is they work great for TV."
R1ZJ9PD8L0XIFI,5,"After years of having the volume waaaay too loud on our television due to my husbands lack of hearing, I now have peace in my home!  Not only can I read the paper without distraction while he watches his shows, but on days when I'm working next door to the tv room, I can actually hear my client's voices on the phone!  This solution couldn't have come sooner.  The sound quality is excellent and the ear phones appear to be quite comfortable."
R28FWUR5BNUBQ7,5,"I have had three previous wireless headsets for use with my TV for late night watching and they were infrared and were low cost / low quality which present problems like a constant background hum or hiss.  I finally decided to get a more expensive unit and after reading several reviews I settled on the Sennheiser RS120.  Installation was very easy and I love the fact that the base has a plug in transformer and the headset has rechargeable batteries that get charged on the base's cradle. I had modified previous units with old telephone charging transformers to cut down on battery use and this unit has a transformer already included. The greatest thing I love about this headset is the sound quality.  I actually hear low background sounds that were missing from watching my TV set to low volume. I can hear birds chirping in outdoor scenes and the creepy crawly sounds of space creatures lurking somewhere in the dark that I did not know were there from the sound coming from my TV speakers.  Music sounds better than from my TV speakers as well.  I am very happy about the over all quality of this product.  Adjusting the volume is not as hard as some people have stated.  The tuning and volume buttons are close together, but you get used to which one is which by feel and I find that I rarely have to adjust volume on my headset anyway.  I am happy."
R277SKWWGBZPK7,1,"It worked for about 3 hours, after which the base unit would not stay powered on and would not re-charge the headset.  I retuned it.  Very disappointed and unexpected from Sennheiser, who otherwise has a reputation for quality audio products."
RC9YLHRJ8FC5M,1,Stopped working after 2 months.  Now I get only static sound.  Piece of crap and extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time and money.
R17MKF44JFMB6E,5,"I bought these from Amazon a few days ago, and they are well worth every dollar. Before these headphones, I had the Sony MDR-IF240RK wireless headphones. The sound quality was good for music, but bad for high-quality speech. The volume control also shorted out on me only a few months after I bought them, then the headphones themselves started shorting out if I had them on in a certain position. I needed new headphones, and I saw that these Sennheisers were drastically marked down from the retail price, and they were only $15 more than the Sonys I previously had.  To make a long story short, if you're looking for wireless headphones that do the job without costing a lot, there is no better value than these. I can go from room to room with these on, and never miss a beat. The audio quality is clear, and there is no distortion. I'll update this review after I've had them a few months (hopefully they last much longer than the Sonys I had), but so far, I give them my highest recommendation."
R3JXR8ZNLD7Y80,5,Was looking for a headset that worked for me. A little hard of hearing and like to watch late night tv but it bothered my wife. Now I can listen at the desired volume without waking the sleeping beauty. The headset is very clear and distinct. I love them.
R38K5K7FUBVO4H,5,"I bought these for my dad to watch tv at night,  He loves them.  He loves that he can walk to other rooms and still hear the set.  It is perfect that they self charge."
R35QCKUXJRVL54,5,Works great.  Received last year and it worked so good purchased a second unit for a second TV.  Only issue I have is if both TVs are on it picks up signals from both and becomed garbled.
RPCIAECDATYL,2,"I have had a lot of trouble with the controls.  When it's set properly, the headphones sound great!  It's just difficult to get them set there.  Also, when there is no signal (before a video comes on or after it's done) the headphones hiss loudly."
R3A61F99FD624P,4,"The headphone is great as far as the quality of sound and the little noise experience I am getting. As far as using for watching TV, which is my main reason for purchasing this product, it is almost perfect. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because it doesn't fit my head well enough that if I bow my head, if for example I am to pick up something from the floor, the headphone falls off. My previous Sony holds better and stays in my head better. But the sound quality of this product is superior. I have no regrets buying this product."
RBSF7HS6EG021,1,"ATTENTION: MAJOR RISK FOR PACEMAKER WEARERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Buried deeply in a small leaflet that most purchasers would probably ignore is a warning that unusually strong magnetic fields generated by these headphones could cause serious problems for pacemaker wearers.  No doubt, some folks will play down this risk, but any risk of death should be taken seriously, in my opinion.  This information should be prominently displayed on the package and here at the Amazon site, but it is not.  Caveat Emptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  TAP"
R3G9J5QW71B9KL,5,I got these as a gift 2 christmas ago and they still work great. Hear TV or Movies in stereo as loud as you want without disturbing sleeping family members. I always am impressed with Sennheiser products.
R3HTR2YZSHD9SW,4,"these were very easy to hook up and, although a little sensitive, once they are dialed in, the sound is nice. my wife actually prefers to listen to her shows on the headphones versus the tv sound system. good price, great delivery ( amazon prime ). I recommend these highly."
R2IG547Q9YDLFV,4,"These headphones lived up to my expectations. The sound quality is amazing, range is as advertised. Perfect for watching tv after my roommates have gone to bed."
R3HYPR6N5DFFF1,5,I was surprised how easy the Sennheiser RS120 headphones were to set up. Simply plugged the cable from the charging cradle into the RCA jacks on the back of the TV and then plugged in the adapter to an electrical outlet. The headsets worked. I had to fine tune the frequency dial and adjust the volume and I was ready to listen. The clarity on the headphones is really good. I can hear things in programs and parts of commercials that I have never heard before without the headphones. The stereo is really good and I can hear soft stereo sounds I have never heard before from the TV. The range for the Sennheiser RS120 headset is outstanding. I can wear the headphones anywhere in the house and even outside as far as 300 feet away from the TV and still not miss any of the audio on a program or a movie. One problem while watching TV was that we could get the sound from the TV loud enough but could still not hear the dialogue over the background music and sounds. Last night my wife used the headsets to listen to the audio on a movie we were watching.  With the headphones on she could hear everything. The dialogue seemed to stand out from the background. I ordered her a Sennheiser headphone to go with mine last night. Great product.
R1TRQ34JNOY41J,4,"These headphones work great, very comfortable to wear, have good range, & sound quality is great. Can't be beat for the price!!!"
RLDHYD3TSH41G,5,"This item is a great gift and well worth the price.  I bought because a friend recommended. The sound is great, I even ordered a spare set just to have for use with a second TV."
RLSWLO9ZLOJ8N,4,Good ... Works great and the sound is very clear.  Easy to set up and operate.  Bad  ... Sound cuts out when my 900MHz cordless phone is in operation.
R121RBR0UH4RTZ,5,"I bought these headphones for a TV in a condo we own. I wanted something that was comfortable, easy to set-up and reliable. This product has hit the mark on all of these requirements."
R1MJM92I3O418M,1,"Updated, 12/20 - Upon further review, this is a pretty bad product. I am now experiencing the same \\""shut off\\"" that many others were."
R4D3QAQCHCJE,1,"I just received these today and after 5 minutes I knew I had to return them. I will keep it simple and list the reasons why.  1. They are HUGE. I felt like I should be walking on the airport tarmac parking commercial aircraft.  2. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, buzz, hiss and very tinny sounding.  3. The design is over 7 yrs old which is a millennium in electronics ( I should have paid closer attention to the review dates)."
R33174BVMQHSQO,5,"These are high quality wireless TV earphones and the price is right.  The audio quality of this earphone is much better than your TV speakers, almost like surround sound.  Easy to install."
R7JUU2MK4DGNS,2,"I purchased this set based on the reviews. My use case is to use it with my TV in the bedroom. For testing purposes I tried two setups.  1. Connect to my family room home theater system using the provided AV cable  2. Connect to my bedroom TV using the provided AV cable  While connected to the Family room home theater system the Sennheiser RS120 performed very well. There was no extra bass nor extra treble. But, whenever I turned my head I would hear a drop in volume.   While connected to the bedroom TV though I can constantly hear an interference noise. I moved the Sennheiser to multiple positions within the reach of the AV cable, yet I could not avoid the noise. The audio quality was good but the constant hissing noise made me return the set.  I hope they have sets that are insulated better for the RF noise (is there such a thing?)"
RZXTA37Z93KP4,4,"Excellent headphone for clarity and range, and reasonably comfortable. Only down side is that being on-ear, they tend to slip when used while engaging in active tasks."
RL2TZWR9B4NDB,1,"I bought 2 pair and 1 shutdown within 5 months; the other a month later. Previously, I had a RCA set that I bought used at Goodwill 4 years ago and it is still working."
R30KU3OLAQZU8R,5,"The headphones' base station is connected to my satellite dish receiver and is behind closed cabinet doors out of sight.  It was easy to select the appropriate channel to get reception without any interference.  I wear hearing aids and the TV placement does not let me enjoy the surround sound produced by many of the stations without increasing the volume to a level too loud for the rest of the family. The headphones fit over the ears without removing the hearing aids and I can experience the surround sound without changing the TV volume. The reception is good enough to let me walk around the house and onto the porch outside without missing any of the dialog. In addition, the quality of the sound is quite good. While wearing the headphones, the open air design allows me to hear when someone in the room speaks to me."
RMP4Q0SVQR032,2,"I was looking to upgrade from simple wired headphones to wireless ones at work so I could lean back from my desk and not be throttled by a headphone cord.  These Sennheisers seemed promising.<br /><br />After several months of using them, I'm totally frustrated by them:<br /><br />- If I just leave the headphones on my head with nothing playing, the receiver shuts down after a minute or so, blasting my ears with static.  This is absolutely infuriating.  To work around this, I have to constantly be switching the headphones off and on, but sometimes forget to switch them back on when putting them on, leading me to fumble around for a few seconds with the volume on my computer, wondering why I can't hear anything.<br /><br />- When listening to \\""quieter\\"" stuff, such as piano music or spoken words, the headphones never register that any audio is coming through and will again cut off after a minute or so.  I have to constantly be adjusting the volume on my computer to compensate to remind the headphones that yes, I really do have stuff playing.<br /><br />- I find that the position/rotation of my head can significantly alter the quality of the sound (with regards to static, etc), even though I'm only about 3 feet from the base station thingy.<br /><br />- I don't listen to stuff very loudly, yet the speakers have blown out and the lower ranges sound terrible.  Fortunately my unit is still under warranty; I just have to get around to sending them in, waiting for them to be fixed, etc.  For a brand such as Sennheiser, I would've expected things to last much longer.<br /><br />In retrospect, I would not have bought these headphones."
RKO63G97HRSGB,2,"I read over reviews on Amazon before pulling the trigger on this set. I really needed it for late night PC use while the gf is asleep. I was really disappointed after the 1st nights use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The sound has quality. I don't have a very trained ear so listening to headphones always sounds good to me.<br />- Very light weight! Very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Static noise is very apparent. It is setup as my default playback sound on Windows 7. It is very random but when I turn on my PC the headphones blast off with static (fixed after spending 30 seconds to tune the headphone)<br /><br />It isn't very visible, but there is a volume button and a tune button on one side of the headphones. After I tuned correctly, it worked great. I moved 10 ft away from the source, it still sounds very nice, however, small movements of my head would generate static interference. (There aren't any other electronics between myself and the PC)<br /><br />- Started to get very annoying to tune the headphones every time I turned on the headphone set and/or PC.<br /><br />Result:<br />Returned this item. Sennheiser's other RS headphones may be great but this one definitely is not. Using Logitech G930 now."
RQ8JL3PALYIG5,5,"December 12, 2011.  I purchased this item approximately one week ago. Excellent quality and easy setup. Some static as I got more than  two rooms away from the device. My wife is happy she can now read while I watch TV.  I would recommend it and I woulkd purchase it again."
R3VC45ZRHMO13D,5,"I have had my Sennheiser RS120 headphones for about three weeks now and I really don't know how I have lived without them. From way too much time as a roady in my youth, way too much loud music all my life, and running all sorts of equipment without hearing protection I have a very hard time hearing normal conversations.    DVR/DVD watching TV with the Minister of Finance (my charming bride) has become routine in my 59 year old life. Unfortunately no matter how loud I turned up the sound I missed a lot, especially dialog. Cranking it also made the MOF uncomfortable.  She was also very tired of listening to my audio in the other room - that's how loud I had to crank it to hear it.  I have a strange AV configuration. The cable is wired both into a BOSE theater system and my BOSE computer speakers. Normal mode is to listen with the computer speakers feeding the cable signal into them.  When the MOF is here we just listen to the sound on the TV.  The BOSE Theater is only used rarely.  Like watching Woodstock on DVD.  No matter how much I cranked the TV I couldn't hear Henry VIII whisper sweet whatever's into whichever was the current squeeze. I tried to read lips, but that was a pain.  I looked at lots of options, and chose the Sennheiser RS120 primarily because of the reviews here. I have come to trust them a lot in my shopping decisions.  As Amazon usual, there were no problems with ordering/shipping/receiving. Installation was a snap, and they were considerate enough to include a Y plug to turn the RCA jacks into a mini - nice touch and they were useful. Rechargeable batteries were included.  Literally plug and play, although I let the batteries charge all night. Perhaps the niftiest design feature is the wire loop cradle for the recharging. With virtual reckless abandon you can drop them on the charger. I have never run out of juice and worn them for hours.  The sound is AWESOME.I am hearing things, especially from the TV, that I have never heard. They sound as goodas my BOSE acoustic headphones and add the value of being wireless. Ranges is great, base is OUTSANDING.  Be advised these comments are made by someone with real hearing issues - I can't imagine how good they would sound with undamaged ears.   The controls on the headset are a little awkward but in time familiarity comes into play. I always turn them on/off in my hands so that's not a problem. The volume is the top right knob and is sensitive to the volume from the device.  The tune knob is the lower nob and when needed, is difficult to use when you lose a signal.  I have been more than 150 ft. from the unit and have had no problems. I can use them in the garage, and will be interested to see how much of the three acres of mowing can be done listening with them.  Sound quality does not drop significantly with distance.  The only knock I have on the the unit is probably due to the way I have it configured.  On occasion, not frequently, but enough to be annoying, it will drop the signal and provide the screech/squawk of a two-way radio. When this occurs I often have to plug/unplug the cable signal and retune the headphones.  This also occurs, again on occasion while surfing and opening a page in the browser. It would be my guess that if I had a single input source I wouldn't have this problem.    I am thrilled that I now get to hear things, and hear them better than I have in years. The Minister of Finance is overjoyed at not having to listen to Iowa Hawkeye radio broadcasts in the other room.  If possible, I would give this product ten stars for the way it has improved the quality of my life. I wish I had a pair years ago. Almost better than sliced bread."
R2MKZA92QE96CX,2,"The earcups have no rotational adjustment and they dig into the front of your ears/temples.  I don't understand how they can be touted as  comfortable!  I guess the sound was pretty good, and the simplicity of the stand....but I sent them back."
R3F7AFP3MD8NAI,5,"I have owned several wireless headphones and believe me this is the best ever. Good sound, comfortable, easy to recharge, and best of all its price. Strongly recommend."
R2MIO6I13K37GB,5,"excellent sound quality and a very durable headset. I can take it all around the house and still hear everything ! DO NOT buy IR headsets, thats unless you don't want to hear half of what you are intending on hearing. buy these you will not be disappointed in the least. very good price too !"
R3OD0ME3CWVX46,5,"Excellent headphones (... not my first Sennheiser's).  Easy instructions, simple setup and then turn on the source and it locks in. The headphones are used in connection with a 32\\"" VIZIO LED LCD TV (E321MV).  Sound quality is awesome, producing clean highs and nice deep lows.  Static problems, are not an issue (static issues are usually caused by other sources on the same electrical circuitry).  The headphones not only work well throughout our two-story house, but also outside in an attached garage. Light weight headphones won't become tiresome; however, they will fall off if you lean forward to pick up something.<br /><br />The Sennheiser headphone 3.5-mm plug adapter, with RCA connectors for cabling, becomes a tight fit on the back side of the Visio when the two RCA male connections are attached.  But watch out for what you replace it with because the Sennheiser receiver is quite sensitive.  I connected Sennheiser's 3.5mm gold-coated jack into an input/output 3.5mm connector (not gold coated) for the TV input (for easier removal) and the Sennheiser worked fine for about 10-minutes and then started failing.  Finally the green light went out all together.  I shut everything down and restated, but still no connection with the TV ... only static on the headset (no green light).  After trouble shooting all connections and finally removing the non-gold coated connector, the problem ceased to exist and it has been working perfectly since.  I have ordered a gold-coated 3.5mm male jack with two female RCA connectors attached at the ends of two 6\\"" wires to replace Sennheiser's adapter.  Not an issue, just a convenience work around for me, but its noteworthy that the Sennheiser is sensitive to cabling changes (resistance).<br /><br />These headphones work the way I hoped they would."
RKBNDJ3GEK42R,5,"I got this for my dad who is very picky about everything.  He has a slight high-frequency hearing loss and uses hearing aids, but his low pitch hearing is better than most people's.  The problem with him listening to TV before was that if my mom was doing stuff in the next room like unloading the dishwasher, the noise from that was annoying to him when he was watching TV and wearing his hearing aids.  With the Sennheiser RS120, he doesn't hear any hiss, and he doesn't have to wear his hearing aids which he likes.  He doesn't have to hear my mom clattering around in the kitchen either which means she can do what she wants and not worry about annoying him (picky butt).  So it's a win-win for everyone.  He's impossible to buy anything for, and I'm just really happy that he likes this so much."
RH3CIHBHMZRIU,1,The headphones didn't work as described. They loose the TV signal every time I used them and are really uncomfortable. They are worthless; please don't even think to buy them
R80ZPPN86TQQU,3,"My wireless headphone Advent AW770 was out of order after many years of extensive usage. I saw this Sennheiser RS120 at Fry's electronics for $120. I find it online almost half the price, $67.33 with shipping.   It has nice design and easy to charge, however some times it has static and not easy to adjust it. My old headphone had an red diode showing when it was on, which this one has not such. It's well worth for the price I bought.  s"
RFEZ3E2K2N1EE,5,"Comfortable to wear, and volume is adjustable from a whisper to more than you need.  When my wife wears them in bed, I cannot hear the sound even though I'm laying right next to her."
R2R58QXKXSLX9Q,5,This headset is awesome for the price.  i have a bose headset and my husband prefers this one over the bose.... it is worth every penney.
R1WR8PHQR0R67Y,5,"My husband recently bought me a treadmill.  I though that I could walk while watching my favorite shows.  I was sadly mistaken.  The treadmill was to loud to hear the t.v. over.  That is when I asked y husband if they made headphones that hook-up to the t.v. He went on the search for me.  He did a lot of research and settled on these.  They cost a little more than some, but well worth it.  Not only am I able to walk on the treadmill and hear my t.v. shows, but also around the house and outside.  What is the point you ask?  Well I put the t.v. on music and clean without bothering anyone with the volume.  However sometimes I start singing and since they can't hear my music, it is awful!  The sound produced by these headphones is exceptional!  It is really clear.  There is a tuning wheel on the side that helps you get the signal from the base perfect no matter the distance.  I am sure that there is a certian distance that these will no longer work, but I have yet to find it in my 1.5 arce of land and house.  I just mess with the tuning wheel when it gets a little fuzzy and the sound is crisp and clear.  They fit nicely on my head too.  They are padded for extra comfort, this helps.  They also fit my husband comfortly.  The base charger is also sleek and easy on the eyes.  We have it set up right next to the t.v. in the master and it blends in.  Charge time is super short and it seems they stay charged forever!  I have used them for 7 days for 4 hours a day without charging. (kept forgeting to take them to the bedroom till I needed them again.)  I have had this product for a few months no with absolutly no complaints!  ~ Happy Shopping ~"
R39IEIFK3G1WT5,1,My wife bought these for me to use because she has an ear condition by which she cannot tolerate sound very well. I tried them and the sound keeps cutting out. They are unusable and Amazon shouldn't even be selling such a defective product. Beware.
R3581H3SD8MX1J,1,"I bought the item this Sep, used once, which was already broken on Nov, I was too busy to even go get returned/fixed but pretty pissed about wasting $70 for a piece of junk. I don't usually write any reviews but to just warn you not to repeat same mistake i made."
R1NT8KF164NJER,2,"I will be returning these.  After all the positive reviews these seemed like a bargain, but they were incredibly disappointing.  My biggest complaint is that these are very uncomfortable.  Unlike other large headphones which use a soft rubber ring around the earpieces, these are just flat with a scratchy soft material covering them.  I cannot imagine wearing these through an entire movie.  They are hot on your head and make your ears hurt after 10 minutes or so.  The sound is mediocre at best with a fairly noticeable hiss. I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone.  Save your money and buy something better."
R2TNWI3TXP854P,5,These wireless headphones are the greatest.  I purchased them for watching TV and being able to here while there is noise in the room produced by a loud 4 year old.
R2283QT55X5TA2,3,"I bought the headphones despite of the numerous reviews that talked about the static sound and some noises...well, their explanation not even came close to how annoying it can be. Don't get me wrong, the sound is fantastic once it is up and running, and the fact that you have the ability to change the volume right in the headphones comes quite handy when you are walking around the house while listening to the news (!).   But I can't get over the fact that sometimes you have to unplug and plug again because the sound will not come in, or the static noise you get before you turn in your TV...It should be completely silent, right???  But if you can live with this minor annoyance the sound is great!"
R1Q68VDMAB6TRR,5,My first wireless headphone experience and I'm very pleased with my choice of the Sennheiser RS120 product.  Here are my rating points which justify my overall score:  Sound - excellent (5) stars - just what I would expect from a headphone company in business for so many years  Build quality - excellent (5) stars  Design / comfort - very good (4) stars - have a tendency to slip forward and off the head at times  Wireless operation - excellent (5) stars  Price value - excellent (5) stars  My overall score (5) stars - excellent and highly recommended
R2P90Q1QJZI35E,5,after seeing the advertisements on tv decided to check the reviews on this product and glad i purchased this instead of wasting money-the sound quality is excellent-easy to replace on charger
R2HP3VDRC4YJLK,1,"I was very excited to order a pair of these headsets for viewing TV quietly. They were great at first and had good sound quality. On the first day, the base station (transmitter) turned off in the middle of a program. I thought the unit was defective so I tried the other one since we ordered a pair of them. The result was the same, within an hour the (new) base station shut itself off in the middle of viewing again. I gave it a few more days and several more tries with similar results.   If you don't mind the sound cutting off and getting static in the ear suddenly while not being able to turn the base station back on for 1-10 minutes at a time, then this might be an acceptable product for you. I returned both of mine for a refund as it's just too annoying to deal with."
R1JBJ1625B24MM,5,This is an execellant buy. I am very happy with the product. I Am concidering buying another for my summer home.
RT91Z30SXMW2R,5,"When I first got the Sennheiser RS-120's wireless headphones, I found out that you need to let the headset charge probably for the first 24 hours.  I was getting a lot of the symptoms that others have complained about; hissing, sound only coming out on the left headphone, hit & miss when tuning, might be in tune or not.  But after I charged the headphones for at least 4 hours, I tried it again; sound came out of both headphones, the hiss was gone, very easy to tune.  I started wearing hearing aids about 1 1/2 years ago and watching netflix movies was extremely frustrating but now with the headphones I can clearly hear all TV shows & Netflix programing.  They also allow you freedom to move about the area while continuing to hear.  I highly recommend this headphones to others that have the same problems."
R1NP64MT7ESX3L,5,"This is the best product I brought from Amazon. Sound quality is amazing - can't wait to use this on threadmill while watching TV.  I was able to listen to the TV in every room (including the bathroom). I am very apprehensive about buying electronics - not sure if you got the best product/price etc. I read a lot of reviews before buying a product. In spite of this, I am wrong more than 50% of the time. I bought a monster tape adapter for iPhone (from Amazon) - piece of crap.  This product, however, is amazing. You wouldn't go wrong with this. Hopefully, my review helps somebody in my shoes."
R1SBSH6U46YLDQ,3,"The sound is fantastic, but be careful with the volume control. On mine it was very poorly constructed, try to increase the volume and you might turn deaf, lower it and there is no sound. If you try to change the volume very slowly, it works, but only sometimes. I am exchanging it for another, hoping that it will work the way it should.  I would recommend this due to the fantastic sound only if the volume control is fixed."
R22CDF3FYSOTQN,5,I bought the wireless headset on a recommendation and love them. I find I do not miss any dialogue anymore and everything comes through so clear with even background sound so lifelike. I get none of the background hiss that people mention while the sound is activated. As a show goes to commercial I may hear a slight hiss but it is not bothersome. I recommended these headsets to two other friends and they love them.
R3FLEEWNBJVSHH,4,"Am very satisfied with the sound quality.  It is amazing for low-end wireless headphones.  I have   three complaints however.  There are no lights to signify on or off.  The on/off switch is very small and put together rather cheaply.  The headphone itself does not sit on the head very steadily; if I am in a sitting position and want to stand, I have to hold the headphones or they will fall off of my head.  I have used Acoustic Resources Headphones previously and they seemed more high end, but sound quality is about the same."
R2HH30VX1YTZW2,5,"After reading other people's reviews I decided that the first thing I am going to do is test the complaints. So certainly, I tested the most popular complaint which is the auto-shut off feature, which turns off the transmitter base and leaves the listener with loud static. First of all, it is not loud static because these headphones DO NOT have the power to blast your ears as some reviewers commented. It does startle you a bit if you've been listening to silence for several minutes. But it does not blast your ears at all. One fact nobody mentioned is that the transmitter will wait for about 3 minutes of silence before it shuts off, which is plenty of time for most situations. Some reviewers made it seem like it would shut off immediately after it detected silence. Obviously, if you're going to be using these headsets with a computer it could be a problem. In that case, I would use a wired headset because when you are browsing the internet on a computer, you could spend a long time without hearing a sound. So think carefully what you're going to be using these headsets for before you buy them.   Now for a bit of critique: In 2011, don't you think that technology is advanced enough to have implemented at least an auto-silence feature so that when the transmitter shuts off, it mutes the headphone? I mean FM auto-mute is an 1980's technology that even some car radios had back then to mute the FM static when no signal is being received. But anyway, on to my next item.   Along with the auto-shut off feature many people hate (which I find to be no problem at all), some complained that after the transmitter shut off, if you started sending audio to the transmitter base again, the transmitter did not turn back on. This is totally false. If you spend a whole 3 minutes listening to dead air silence and the transmitter shuts off, when the transmitter begins to receive audio again it will turn back on automatically and the headset will receive the audio again. However, what I found disturbing is why doesn't the headset turn off after it stops receiving the signal from the transmitter? I waited a whole 5 minutes after the transmitter shut off listening to FM static and the headset never shut off. If I was a manufacturer of quality products, I would've considered that.  Onto more positive things. For most listening occasions, these headsets will deliver crisp, full range audio with punchy bass. I was very pleased with the sound quality. However, if you are a DJ, don't expect these are going to be loud enough for you. I did find that you could easily make the bass distort as the headset itself is not powerful enough for me (I am a DJ). But for most occasions, (watching TV, listening to music in the quiet, etc.) these will do fine, though. What I found is you need to be careful with the audio input to the base. If it is too loud, you may get distortion (which is natural), and if it is not loud enough, you may hear some hissing in the background. So for those of you complaining about hissing, check to make sure your source is loud enough. I am using the headphone output from my home stereo so I can control the audio level going to the base. One nice thing though is that the base will automatically level the sound for you. If the incoming audio is low, the base will automatically amplify the audio level being transmitted to the headset. If you suddenly increase the audio level going to the base, it will automatically level it down to keep the same consistent level for you. Nice feature! I did not find that these feature dampened the dynamic range though, so your audio contrast between loud and soft sounds is nicely maintained.  I can't comment much on the battery life as I just got these, but I will probably update on that in the future. But about the signal range, I find it to be very powerful. Very minor static when walking around which is normal for FM communications, but I can go to the backyard without a problem, but why would I need to dothat when I can't see my TV from there?  Another thing, I find wearing them for a long time to be no problem. They are very comfortable and the open design is not a problem at all. Some people complained about the open design allowing for ambient noise to contaminate the audio experience, but to be honest, once I was listening to something I could not notice any distracting ambient noise.  One last thing, I find that the volume control and frequency tuning controls are hard to find by touch while wearing the headset. I guess I might get used to that in the future, but I always find myself struggling looking all around the area where I think they are with my hands until I find them. Same thing with the power switch. Other than that, these are fine headsets that I find most people will be pleased with. Since all I care is sound quality, comfort and durability, the minor flaws of this product is nothing to complain about so I gave it 5 stars. Very good for the price!"
RSMVXE1JIZ20L,5,"I can finally hear the TV! AND I can understand what they say without captioning! I will never understand what took me so long. I love them. Get them, you will not regret it."
R3QXT4YQRB8K3L,1,"I received the headphones today and hooked everything up per the instructions. The lights would not come on when I plugged the wall jack in. Looks like other people had the same problem. The company obviously does not have the proper quality controls in place. Maybe Amazon should offer wireless headphones, I am still on the first generation Kindle and it works great!!I will be sending these back to Amazon tomorrow."
R64J5I1NBL62S,5,"These wireless phones were purchased so I could have some peace as my (going deaf) wife watches her TV programs. You know, those kind of shows that make most men want to go split a chord of wood in the dark. Anyway, I read all the reviews I could find and did the due diligence. As such, didn't expect much. WRONG!!! These phones are incredible for the price. I expected a least some distortion or RFI... none. These phones were very easy to tune in and they perform very well. No issues with charging cradle - works great!    I used to be the kind of Hi-Fi junkie who owned $3000 speaker cables. I know what good sound is supposed to be (not the hyper-inflated, over-colored, full level distortion that passes today). Certainly, you'll hear lots of stuff you were missing in your programs. However, I've also heard some concert footage and was impressed by the musical qualities. The bass is deep and clear - when it should be. It may lack some body and seperation during complex interludes, but it's better than I expected from these phones. The mid and treble are also better than expected for this price range. The controls were very easy and I've had no problems or mishaps. Have had no distortion, obvious buzz, or other \\""dirt\\"" while using these phones. To be fair - they do get a bit warm on the ears and do tend to be loose fitting as others have mentioned. You may get a bit of listener fatigue if wearing the phones for several hours.     Bottom line... For the price and main purpose of TV programs - very pleased."
RNRA0S7OLDYGF,1,"Got these headphones and sent them right back. I could not hear, the sound was so low at full volume. Heard this from other reviews so sent them back. Got the Sony instead."
R2QKVHSK9M8RR7,5,"For years, as my hearing has degenerated, I've been forced to turn the tv louder to clearly understand dialogue (especially with background music> It's been a battle to get the sound loud enough for me and not so loud as to drive my wife from the room.  With these wireless headphones, I control my own volume, and my wife has the remote so she can find a comfortable level (or mute the sound entirely). I hear every word of dialogue, and find the headphones comfortable."
R17E4HK46GUMD3,5,"Long range without losing signal or distortion even behind walls or barriers. Note, however, the headphones are so good that it could be a problem if there is a second headphone unit plugged into another TV playing in another room, as it will pick up both TVs. Very easy to use right out of box."
RLD4PWJN2XJ7F,3,"First I considered what I paid for the headsets.  Considering that, they are pretty good.  The sound it outstanding.  However, there are some aspects I don't like.  The location,and sensitivity of the tuning control isn't good.  It is very easy to move.  It is located where that when you move or remove the headset and  just touch the control, you mess it up and have to re-tune it.  It should be located on the outside rather than the back and should have some sort of detente.  It other words, it should take an effort to move it.  I mean all you gotta do it bump it.  It fits too tight on my head.  I have yet to find an adjustment.  I'm afraid to try and bend it out to relieve the pressure.  I might break a wire or something and screw up the charging or sound.  If I can safety bend it, I would like to know.  The instructions say nothing.  And, this may be because it's too tight, it's hot.<br /><br />Edit.  I wrote the review to quickly.  After I use them for a while I like them.  They are still hot.  The reception is excellent and I have the base inside a cabinet. I can receive an excellent almost all over the house.  Lesson learned about forming opinion to quickly."
R2MZLP4JG9CU05,5,"I have tried some cheaper headphones (around $20, also available on Amazon) that worked well enough for a few hours then simply stopped working.  I also found the cheaper headphones to be difficult to tune into and receive the signal from the TV.  The Sennheiser headphones have none of these problems.  They are very easy to set up and connect.  Two adapters are included so the receiver can be connected to any type of TV, AV receiver, etc.  The sound produced by these headphones is amazing!  Very clear with the full range (bass to treble) coming through vividly.  Surprisingly, even the 5 channel surround effects that were on the DVDs I watched came through with the headphones!  The range is also great.  The signal came through loud and clear all over the house and even in the backyard!  I like the sound so much that sometimes I wear them for no other reason.  I have used these for less than a full month, so I can't say anything about durability, but I would highly recommend these - especially for the price."
R2CPYTOGCFS9G7,1,"These do not work with plasma TVs, it says so right in the booklet.  It went right back to Amazon."
R3FLEN912UPZDG,3,"If you cannot find instructions on how to hook up this device don't bother.  there are none. Just a few pictures and a few troubleshooting lines.  If your wondering why the power light does not come on when you plug in the base its because you have to turn on the headphones too.  If you have no sound there is a tiny 3 position switch on the base.  slide it to a new position.  for the best results plug this into the headphone jack on your stereo system (adapter supplied) and not into the TV's audio output.  this will mute the sound and only allow to channel to the headphones.  It is light weight and comfortable.  sound is just fine for music and tv.  the headphones do not block out outside noises (doorbell, vacuum, people talking) if you just want to listen to tv-music without bothering others this is the way to go."
R1MIMIBDEB0V2G,2,"Some of us have HD radio, some have digital tuning, and some use those old-school dials to try to tune in properly.  These headphones are like tuning in to the wrong channel...<br /><br />Want a quick preview of how this works?  Do you have a local station at 104.3?  Then tune in to 104.1 or 104.5 - that is as good as these headphones will be.<br /><br />We tried all sorts of tuning and adjustments on these headphones, and at it's *BEST*, it still had loud static.  I have looked at other reviews and comments, where some people say the issue is wireless phones and wireless internet.  Which basically means these would be good WHERE?<br /><br />Returned, good riddance."
R1XF6FXYUAGPXF,1,I should have looked at the over 100 1 star reviews. My unit never even turned on when I plugged it in. You have a green on/off light and a red charging light. The red light came on when I put the headphones on the cradle but the transmitter never turned on so obviously no sound. This item is going back.
R3933WT316QPOF,5,"Received this item today, and all I can say is, \\""WOW!\\"" Finally, my husband will be  able to fall asleep without the TV volume keeping him up. The sound is crystal clear. I hope this item  will last a long time -- Really, I am so very pleased."
R32CSK4GNRAC31,1,I ordered this because I wanted to be able to watch tv and or listen to music at night without disturbing my husband. The quality of the headphones were so poor that the music and television sounds could clearly be heard therefore it kept him awake. the headphones didnt cup the ears as they should. Clarity and hissing was also a big problem. Very disappointed. Sent them right back and bought a cheap twenty five dollar set of another brand which worked just fine. On a good note...Amazon gave me no problem on the return. I was very happy about that.
R144CV9OIWZHHD,2,"I am not really a connoisseur of fine headphones, but, . . . . . let me say this about that, these headphones seem to work perfectly, the sound is fine for me, the battery life is awesome, the range is incredible, but they suck !  They absolutely will not stay put ! If you lay back on a pillow, they shoot off the front of your head. If you drop your sack of Cheetos, there they go again ! God forbid you get up to fix a bowl of ice cream, for they WILL be in the sink ! Absolutely incredible to think that one would have to put up with this kind of design flaw in the 21st century ! If you want headphones you have to balance on your head to use, buy these !"
R1JQW19QRYEO5I,5,"I got these headphones so I can sleep while my girlfriend watches TV in bed. Sound quality is good, with no static or the base shutting off as others have described. I keep the volume on the phones turned down and the volume on the TV turned up, so I think this helps eliminate static and keeps the base from thinking there is no sound and shutting down. The base is about 15 feet away. So far, good sound, no problems with static or shutting off, I can sleep when I have to get up early, and she can watch TV in bed...all is good."
R14AVFV6IAEQ7P,5,"Wow! Clear uninterupted sound at my own personal volume level. Wear them all the time while watching TV, noises from other parts and parties in the house are muffled.  Range is unbelievable. Have walked out the front door down the driveway and still heard the TV clearly."
R2JUH7X0J15XN6,5,My husband has had wireless headphones for watching TV for years.  He has a bit of hearing deficit and without headphones I could hardly stay in the room because the TV had to be so loud. I had purchased him several different brands over the years.  I recently purchased him the Sennheiser 120 and there is absolutely no comparison in the sound quality and comfort!  They are so amazing I purchased a pair for myself for the bedroom TV and my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas.    The product was delivered when promised and in great condition!  Thank you Amazon.
R2K1FA9X1T0X8T,1,"Perhaps I've just been unlucky, but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable.  I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit--after less than a week they went dead; i.e., the charger continued to work, but no transmission.  I returned the unit and got a replacement.  My only annoyance was that, occasionally, it would simply cut off.  Gradually this became more common and annoying.  I knew it had a 2 year warranty, but didn't realize I had owned it as long as I had.  Finally last month, it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs.  When I checked my warranty & sales slip, I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty.  When I prepared to order another one, I mentioned it to my son.  Turned out, he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and--though he didn't return it--he doesn't use it any more because of the sound cut-off.  I realize that any product can have a lemon, but 3 out of 3?"
R2TOSV450YV123,5,I have tried and returned many sets of wireless headphones.  Finally I found a set that I really like.  These headphones have really great sound for the low cost.  Sure there might be better wireless headphones but I really don't want to go to the $250.00+ level for a set of headphones that I use infrequently.  These stay charged really well.  They come with a very nice cable combiner for using with a standard headphone jack.  They hold their tuning well also.  I can walk 30' away and not have to re-tune them in and that allows me to walk around my main floor with no issues and still hear the TV or music.  They are not the lightest headphones in the world but I dont find them to be too heavy either.  They are more than comfortable for a 2 hour movie.  I also like having the volume control on the headset it gives me control without having to find the remote for a quick turn down of those excellent commercials.
R18KYOCGPNB797,4,"I purchased these because I have hearing loss, and some shows are aggravatingly difficult for me to hear at ANY volume. This has been a good solution for me, and for the sanity of others in the home, too. In fact, I bought a second, much more expensive pair of earphones from a the same manufacturer (for use in a bother room), but the second pair was specifically made for assisting in TV viewing. These actually work better for me at less than half the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Comfortable<br />*Rechargeable<br />*Good sound<br />*On-board volume control<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Not adjustable for tightness, and they're a little loose on me<br />*No on-board tone control (ideal for me would be to have a treble control)<br />*Full-sized, so it make it difficult to rest the head on a pillow, etc."
R2NQMEEIFAGP0N,5,"After purchasing two wireless headphones in the past, this one, is by far, the best that I have bought.  The quality of the sound is a good as any high-end studio earphones that I've been able to use.  But then, have always been partial towardt the Sennheisser name.  Excellent transaction and product."
R1C2CLRUEQ7OM4,4,"My husband likes to watch TV in bed and stays up until the wee hours of the morning.  I bought these headphones so we can both be happy.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  We had an older pair that stopped working, and they were very crackly.  The only time you hear any static is when there is no sound playing through them.  They are very comfortable and light as well.  My husband's only complaint is that they are a bit bulky, so he can't really roll on his side to get comfortable."
R2E568KNXBHD9,1,"Very noisy !!! Sound is SH..<br />I hate to write comments, but this one had so many 5 stars, i don't know what people think, or may be only Zenheiser staff is putting these comments.<br /><br />JUST WAIST OF MONEY !!!!"
RZG7CQQD472TA,5,"This is a fabulous product, easy to set up and easy to use.  The earphones are very comfortable and the charging cradle makes for very easy charging.  This is a super value as well."
R17Q0SNT6SJMLG,4,"I bought these headphones for my parents.  They are very pleased with the sound.  They are not as comfortable as others they have used, but they are not bad.  TV shows are more enjoyable and now the volume on the TV does not have to be so loud as to make it uncomfortable for others in the room."
R15YSIJ4J7JBSS,2,"Very convenient to watch TV or play video games at night, but after 7 months, it randomly stopped working.  Even tested it with two different sets of rechargeable batteries.  It just died on me.  Never fell asleep with them, it was always docked at the same spot, never used it for 3 hours straight, and I never left it on accidentally all night.<br /><br />Re-did the plugs, AC adapter, and any other way of resetting/re-installing.  Just died I guess.<br /><br />Going to go with the new SONY PS3 Headset, but still need to find a new wireless headset for TV purposes.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.  Must be a reason it's half off now."
R2QD7KYG4VU1KS,5,"Quality sound, comfortable, easy charging and set up.  I recommend this product highly for anyone who is looking for a quality product yet has a reasonable price."
R2C2OKAHZV6WZJ,5,I wasn't expecting great things since these are wireless headphones. I'm totally impressed. These sound great and are very comfortable. Great price through amazon!!!
R1MD1LTAR7GO36,5,Crisp and clear. It was so good to hear again. I benefitted from this product and would recommend it to any who are hard of hearing.
R2BQ6H3THEQIE4,5,"I thought my hearing was perfect but with these headphones I hear a whole new level of audio.  I would like to crank movies and concerts in surround but live in a townhome, ha, now I can, and not worry about bothering the neighbors.  I also bought two sets for my hard of hearing parents.  The smile on my very hard of hearing dads face when he put the phones on for the the first time was priceless.  We can listen to a program at a nice comfortable level while he gets to do the same with the headphones on.  The TV and Phones have totally seperate volume control."
R3I3HOT7WMI0WK,2,"I got these headphones about a year ago. Over time they started to deteriorate. First, after three months, the cradle stopped charging. So I switched to regular batteries. I have to change the batteries almost once a week or once every two weeks. Lately, the volume is not working correctly. When I turn them on, the volume is fine, but after ten minutes I have to increase it, after an hour I have to increase it again. Basically these are not usable after a year. I'm very disappointed. I expected Sennheiser Headphones to last at least as long as my RCA headphones lasted. I guess they don't make anything like they used to."
RZELYF927KC87,4,"I was very pleased with my purchase.  I gave 4 stars because they do sound excellent, but the snapping and hiss in between tracks is pretty annoying.  Comfy to wear but slippage can be an issue if you are doing stuff while you wear them     I have the Sony's (MDK I think) as well and they are all around a little better product in comparison."
R3GFDYVSB8UM3P,4,"These headphones perform wonderfully. Very good sound, very low noise or interference ( much less noise than my Sonys). They are fairly comfortable to wear. They are fairly rugged. The reason I know that they're rugged is that they are constantly launching themselves off my head! My only problem with them is that if I look down, they slide off. I was just doing dishes and launched them into the sink, again. They are such good headphones, I'd still recommend them- just don't look down."
R3DNTMBOPOMTSY,5,"Distinct, clear voices and great music.  Can receive facing all directions, anywhere in the house as well as outside on the patio and in the yard.  Why can't they make a hearing aid that works this great?"
R2E1VY8L73J62A,4,"These headphones are perfect. I share a room with a person who also has a television and this allows us both to watch our shows at the same time. Not to mention it keeps my television from waking her when I decide to watch BBC at midnight. The only downside is that they don't cover my ears. Like there is no \\""cup\\"" action. So the noise cancelation isnt all that great but I pretend that it is when my roommate talks. All in all, I'd definitely say these headphones ARE worth the buy. The recharging Stand and the auto shutoff are great features."
R31IJEX0ZJO9X2,5,"For years I've had to keep turning up the tv volume. I'm a night owl and after the rest of my family went to bed they would complain about the noise keeping them awake.  The speech was muffled and foreign accents were impossible. I would keep asking my husband, \\""what did they say?\\""  I could'nt afford hearing aids so after researching my options I decided on wireless headphones. I've had good results with other purchases from AMAZON so after looking at the options I chose  Sennheiser RS120 926 wireless headphones.   I am so pleased with my headphones. I can distinctly hear every word. I especially like being able to mute the tv and still hear. My family especially likes that feature !  I reccomend these headphones to others with similar hearing problems."
R22J0CEV5UTXC5,5,I don't know how good the high dollar wireless headphones are but these seem quite good for the price. I can plug my IPod in and listen to my music all through out the house. Charging is simple and easy. Well made product and I would definitely buy again.
RMITADYCSV26S,3,The reception was good but not totally crisp.The price point was good compared to other web sites.  The headphone earpieces were not as comfortable as an earlier model and slipped off easier.
RWBNINK2LDLI6,5,Works well very and has good sound quality. But there is a small hiss. I can use it all over my house.
R3D0TUGWIX0J00,5,"I have had a pair of Sennheiser RS120 headphones for over 4 years. I use them for 3-4 hours a night and I am still on the same rechargeable batteries. The sound quality and clarity are unparalleled. I paid $100 for them back then and they are worth it. Of course, I'll settle for a lower price. I am just about to purchase a second pair to add to my house. Absolutely love these. Do not hesitate to purchase!"
R3SF7E9EJSUZ4N,4,Good value for the money.  Reception is good from at least 30 feet. Good surround sound effect. Comfortable to wear.  Would recommend it to my friends.
R38PL8QR3FO68T,1,Was very excited to get these headphones. They were great for a little while. Used them maybe 10 times. Then they just stopped working. Would not recommend them.
R1TPL7LL8EE9ZY,3,I purchased these headphones to connect to TV. That purpose is not that we'll served. The tuning wheel is very close to the volume control. So accidentally one can turn it instead of the other. There is a annoying hum. One has to keep adjusting ones position for better reception even if you are sitting barely 30ft away in line of sight. TV Ears had a better sound quality but their reliability was terrible. That is why I purchased these Steihauser.
RVPZXS62ZBFV,5,"Easy to charge, has good long range, and good audio quality.  I lived in an apartment on the fifth floor, thick walls (brick) and laundry room was on the 2nd floor, was able to leave the headphones on and walk all the way down to the laundry room while still being able to hear my tv. These are perfect if you like listening to your tv at whatever volume you want but have had neighbors that you don't want to disturb.   When I'm done after a long day and I just want to relax these essentially become part of my head, and using them as such is so much fun. Plus they are pretty tough too.  With so many products made to just be \\""good enough\\"" this product is great and at a great price. If you like tv/video games, and don't want to have to worry about waking up neighbors, this product is a must."
R9QDISFYSNCOH,2,The headphones worked with an older TV in the spare bedroom but my newer TV in the living room did not have the proper connections for this device.
RY6IXZ4ZYKMUV,5,"easy to install right out of the box. great sound in all the rooms of the house, and even outside in the yard. i would highly recommend this product."
R35VC4PDJ9FGQX,4,"Sound quality -  very good  Ease of use - excellent  Fit - adequate, although not adjustable for tightness.  They can fall off if you look down too far.  Otherwise, these would rate 5 stars.  Range - excellent  Value - very good."
RBS32B4OV0B79,5,"My husband is hard of hearing and watching TV with him was a battle of volume control.  He has TV Ears but the batteries were always going out and you must face the receiver or lose the sound.  Further more TV ears held you hostage by having to buy from them a replacement battery.  I was looking for something different.  Sennheiser RS120 was more money, but you are able to walk around and still hear your show.  So far, so good and would highly recommend them."
R31VZZZ2XQ3JDL,5,"I had these but didn't use them because I could turn my tv sound up loud enough to hear by. Then one day my neighbor said that my TV was so loud they had trouble sleeping. So I started using these and what a world of difference they made! I have hearing aids, but with these I don't have to wear them because the sound is adjustable loud enough for me.  For those who say it is not loud:  There are two dials on the left earphone. The top one is Volume, the bottom one is Tuning. Turn the \\""tuning\\"" dial until you get a loud clear signal, then the headset WILL be loud enough for you. If it is not tuned in exactly, you WILL hear it, but the volume will not be anything like it could be and you might not even get stereo. So, take the time to tune the bottom dial first. If you think it is not working on your set, Tune the bottom dial first to get a signal, then decide if it works or not.  I love these!!"
R22TIVYTU7V38E,2,"Technically, functionality and sound are very good. The negative is you could not have designed a worse set of headphones. They are uncomfortable and fall off your head with any movement. I can't believe they went to market with such a poor design. Fix the headphones and you've got a great product!"
R8YW2EVXQCWPD,1,"The headphones stopped working the second time I used them, about a week after I got them. Need I say more?"
R12VYOE7TT5JVQ,1,"Tried on multiple TVs I couldn't get this to work. I got static most of the time except for once when I got a neighbors phone conversation loud and clear!  It didn't matter where I placed it. I also tried new rechargeable batteries and charged them before testing, but it just doesn't work. I'm VERY disappointed, considering all the 5 star ratings. I'm going to try the Sony infrared, since I don't care if it \\""works through walls\\""  Sent it back! Thank heavens Amazon makes that easy!"
R2CI355D7DDQV7,5,The quality of these headphones are superb. Audio is crisp and clear. I love the freedom of walking around the house listening to music w/o disturbing my wife as she watch tv etc.
R1ZBVJBUT06KXV,5,"I own two pair, so that I always have one charged and ready. I can go to the mailbox (75ft away) while wearing these headphones listening to the TV. Honestly they sound better than any TV I own, and I have a 62 inch in den and a flat screen in bedroom. Absolutely a necessity if your spouse goes to bed before you. You won't believe the sound quality, great base, wonderful clarity. One of my better decisions. You will just keep on finding new ways to use them. GET THEM."
R2YA310YM0F4RD,2,"The headphones are not that great, as the volume is low and does not give a good music experience. I was expecting something good from Sennheiser, but these are very average."
R2JP6CDWV8KJGM,5,These are great headphones for the price!  The sound quality is superb and the reception is excellent.  Great for those with hearing loss or for someone who wants to hear while they are active around the house.
R2DFAJGTUOSIJI,2,"When they work, they sound decent and are comfortable. In my office environment, however, I can't get away from annoying background noise, on all the channels and with every conceivable transmitter position.<br />What's more annoying, however, is that if there is no audio going to the transmitter, it shuts off. I use these on computer that makes infrequent noises when I'm not listening to music - so this happens very frequently. When it does happen, the headphones just start amplifying background noise, louder and louder, until I have to take them off. There needs to be a control to disable this, or the headphones need to be smart enough to shut off when the transmitter is off."
R1IS0Z4PECH309,4,"These headphones worked as described, but I still think there should be a better relatively inexpensive set of wireless ones on the market by now."
R1ILQD375CPB8L,5,I purchased one of these for transcription work and it worked so great (and with no cords hanging around) that I purchased a second one.  Received them quickly.  Very happy!
RM50UPEK43LYV,1,"Nice design, style and comfort although reception quality was poor at best. There was an almost constant static unless I sat or stood still. I couldn't walk and roam about the house unless I wanted to move slowly to minimize the reception static. I thought no way they would sell something of this poor quality for the price I paid but, sure enough. I became frustrated and returned for refund assuming if I'm going to go wireless I'm going to spend the money to be satisfied or disregard wireless altogether which is what appears to be be the best route to satisfy my need for quality."
R21CV0UZ8KPTUF,4,"With any tech product, it pays to know what you're doing. I thought the unit had died but it turned out I had not read the FAQ's on the manufactuirer's site about LCD TV interference with this unit's transmitter. Moved the unit two feet away (3 foot cord) and it works fine again. Yes, I feel dumb!!!"
R1SQ68JKR8PG2M,5,"This is a great product for a hearing impaired person.  My husband loves his.  I can have the TV set at a comfortable level for me, and he can hear it perfectly with the use of the headphones.  Thanks for great service, Amazon.  [[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
R2WSMMOC3QNI1H,4,"product was easy setup, worked directly with audio source plugs on my Sony TV. Easy to charge and range of signal was better than I expected. Headsets sit on my head well, but the flat ear cups with limited cushioning cause pressure points on my ears after about an hour of use. I would have given these a 5 except for the discomfort of the ear cups. Great sound though."
R1EV3KE4PI4YDP,4,"The instructions could be clearer, but it functions well once properly connected.  The sound quality is very good.  The headset could be more comfortable.  The range is very good. Overall 4 plus stars."
RDI39SW4YB6FH,1,"These headphones were very prone to hiss and interference from nearby electronic equipment. However the thing that makes these impossible to use is if you are listening to nothing (playlist ends) for five minutes or so, the headphones don't switch off but instead switch to a mode where they deafeningly blast static into your ears. Makes this product practically unusable."
R39HV7QCDH44E0,5,"TURN IT UP, I CAN'T HEAR...had become spouse's refrain much too often. Purchased Sennheiser RS120 Wireless RF Headphones.  End of problem. Simple to set up, easy to use. This product delivers great sound clarity at very reasonable cost.  Could not be happier with my purchase. Now, TV level normal and both hear well.   Highly recommended if this sounds like your situation."
R2Q84AUR64HBKI,1,"These headsets were way too bulky to be comfortable. The cradle was flimsy and headsets kept falling off. These may be good for certain people, but we definitely did not like them and returned them. Amazon was wonderful about handling the return. I do a lot of business with Amazon, and this was one of the very few things I have ordered that did not work out."
R2QLJUII2WBD2B,5,The headphones were easy to set up and they work perfect. I am very pleased with the product. The price was great.
R1JQVV9M8SJHIW,5,these are marriage savers.  husband kept volume up so long it was driving me crazy.  this is our 2nd set of these.  great device
R3JAI03MHCGDDP,2,"Technically, item is as described.  Like the concept but do not like choice of materials. I realize lightweight is a design goal but the lack of reinforcement in the plastic headband is a dealbreaker for someone with a larger head.  After 2nd or 3rd use the headband is sprung and falls off.  Would not buy again."
R1MZ2D9NNH5KL9,5,"I received my headphones promptly and after getting a splitter for my DVR, the headphones work great. I can set the TV on the lowest level and not disturb my wife who goes to bed early. I can walk around my house and listen to Fox news while I am doing household duties. Very comfortable and sound is soft and clear."
R166B93LSTTO2F,4,I bought this set of headphones so that my wife could watch late night TV while I slept and I could get caught up on the early news in the AM while she slept.  Perfect. The only negative issue with these headphones is that they seem to be made for someone with a much bigger head than either of us has. They are very wide and tend to slip off your head.  That being said -- the sound quality is superb and I can use them anywhere in my house and out on my deck as well(I have discovered that I can listen to music too). Not recommended for someone with a small head but otherwise perform as advertised.
R201E8WVV9JHWM,4,"Initial usage is very satisfying. The clarity of the transmission is as advertised, fine tuning to eliminate interference is easy and precise. Clarity of audio range lends itself to a pleasant listening experience."
R3C48JPB0IVJYA,5,"I have them for about a month so far no complain. I use them inside an outside and the distance is pretty good. I recommend them. This is an update since my last review. It's about two years since I have bought this products, they are both still working fine I have no problem with them and I still love it and I would recommend them."
R13XAAAUJWNY70,5,"This is my second set of these headsets. The first ones are about eight years old and still work like a charm.  I bought them just for watching TV, and they make all the difference in the world. No longer do I have to guess what is said.  The charging stand is simple to use. No wires to connect to the headset. I highly recommend them. You can't beat them for the money. I know, I tried earlier."
R213GYE5VUDB23,3,"I got these headphones to finally have a set that my cat doesn't destroy, he loves eating headphone cables...  The sound quality is nice and the range is very good too. I do must have some sort of disturbance in my house as I get static depending on where I sit. If I go outside with them with the receiver inside the house they work great.  I only gave 3 stars as I find them a bit too heavy and tight on top of the head. I have to say my scalp is freakishly sensitive but I do think one could make these lighter altogether."
RMJYR6B0BFDU2,2,These were exactly what I was looking for - I could hear the TV while I rowed or went into another room.  They were comfortable although they are big and they are quite light. The charge lasted a while too.   But! I am very sorry to say that the left ear went out just 3 months after I bought them and they are just too expensive to be a throwaway item.
R26B1SCJV8FVZY,3,"James Sweet got it pretty much spot on when he described these headphones.  I was tired of the wire on my wired headphones constantly breaking so I decided to give these a shot.  I won't be returning them, but they're definitely the last pair of wireless headphones I'll be buying.  My complaints:  The hiss - I'm no audiophile, but the hiss is noticable to me. This can be reduced some buy increasing the input level and turning down the volume on the headphones.  The automatic volume control - If you have a song that has quiet parts and loud parts, it will automatically reduce the volume on the loud parts. The last thing I want when a loud part of the song comes on is for my headphones to turn down the volume! very annoying.  The construction - Not poor quality construction, just poorly thought out. The earpads are very flat and just rest on top of your ears. The headphones dont stay on your head very well. If you like to listen to music while doing work, you will have trouble with the headphones wanting to fall off of your head.  Aside from the problems mentioned above, they do their job and the sound quality is pretty good. I haven't used other wireless headphones so I can't compare these to others, but I would suggest finding a good pair of wired headphones with a wire that won't break if that's your reason for wanting to switch to wireless"
R33O3QNCWIC1Q9,5,"Thw wife and I are both hard of hearing and we each wear hearing aids but the Headphones have done such great job of making our hearing and understanding of each word as it comes through our TV Set very sharp with excellant clarity. The Sennheiser R120 for the price is remarkable As a result we now own two Sennheiser. Thank you.- As a famous actor would say, \\""You May my (our) Day\\"""
R107GBSJXKWBCL,4,"I have had other headphones that worked Ok for a while, but then quit working. These are the best so far. I can even walk outdoors and still hear the TV show. These are great for the price I paid and I certainly like the RF better. Sometimes I have to retune them but that is no big deal. My wife loves them since she can keep the TV volume much lower now."
RN1X9S85OY54K,4,"I researched this item on the computer.  I could not tell the exact shape of the earpieces.  I like this headphone except for the ear cushion.  It is too flat.  If you tilt your head wrong the headphones fall off.  ALSO, THEY ARE NOT REAL COMFORTABLE.  iT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT WITH THE PADDED EARMUFF TYPE EAR PIECE.  Although I like the quality of this product, I would not buy another until the earpiece is redesigned."
RS6QRGBDVB7AU,5,This product is a reflection of the quality of Sennheiser audio products. The transfer of sound quality is excellent. I have listened to programs from radios up to 200 feet away from the source with very little noise or distortion. The controls on the headset work well and make it possible to adjust them accurately. This product was recommended to me by a very good friend. He is still a very good friend.
R351S1OBLMV5BG,4,Very good. A bit too large for watching TV in your bed. Frequency resp. excellent  Signal to noise ratio excellent. Easy to access. I'm going to buy a couple more at Christmas.IF the price dosen't go up.  Billy D
RYUO4WWHSI5BO,5,"I have had these for close to 4 years now and have lost sound from the left channel. I have tried switching cables etc., but still no luck. Can the manufacturer give feedback as to what the issue maybe? I would hate to throw these away and get another set before I try to resolve this issue if it's an easy fix...."
R3MX8MSW0HEDTA,5,"I bought this product and liked it so much I bought another.  The wireless range is very good, even through walls and floors.  I am also impressed by how long the rechargeable batteries hold their charge.  Additional headsets are available, but if you own two as I do, you can use both on the same transmitter.  I may even buy a third set!  Amazon, as usual, had a good price and fast shipping."
R30CD7RRMZE1M0,1,"I bought these headphones because I am hard of hearing and I wanted to watch movies on TV at a comfortable sound level without disturbing others in the room.  I played around with them quite a bit but the sound level of the TV (or the stereo system) was equal to what I set the headsets to.  Also, if I tried to move from my chair the interference was awful.  Eeekkk... Get the idea?  I had been using an old set of Koss wireless headphones which were fabulous until they finally gave out. I could set the TV sound at one click and turn my headset up and hear every word.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative.  This wasn't it and I let the 30 return time expire before sending them back.  Do yourself a favor and spend the money... buy direct from Koss (made in USA) and they are guaranteed for life."
ROLPKQLE0GB62,5,"I would give this product 6 stars. I bought these for my mom, and they have been amazing. I tried them myself and the sound quality is so much better than the sound that comes from the TV. The charging base is brilliantly designed, the hook-up to the TV is perfect. A great product at a great price."
R15K1J85PKYAQJ,5,"Four years ago I had a car battery explode next to me, inside a garage.  I now have 10% hearing in my right ear and 50% in my left.  What I do hear is garbled and hard to understand.  I needed the TV to be so loud that my wife could not hear her TV in the next room.  I have tried several other inexpensive ear plug type devices in the past with poor results.  A neighbor told me about the Sennheiser RS120 so I decided to give it a try.  It was easy to hook up, and when I turned it on I couldn't believe how well it worked.  Now I can turn the sound all the way down on the TV (to my wife's pleasure) and hear perfectly.  I can mow the lawn and still hear the game or the news.  It will slip off my bald head if I bend over.  I plan to get a sweat band and then attach the set to it.  A very small problem for something that works so well."
R1YSW930VYXUX6,5,"These headphones rock my socks off. I can can wear these all over the house and outside and still get clear reception. I bought a second pair of them so the rest of my family could enjoy them. They hold a long charge and will work at great distances.<br /><br />Products to compare this product to include those lame TV ears which can sell for like $200 and they break with ease. You can also compare this to that $20 as-seen-on-tv product.. whatever its called and this blows em both out of the water. If you are interested in buying wireless headphones for your television.. look no further, this is the product you should buy."
R1JACA6ZRLHRMP,5,"I'm deaf as a stone from gunshot trauma, and these allow me to watch TV with my wife without her yelling for me to &#34;TURN IT DOWN&#34;."
R12FLQ0N889C9R,5,"I could not be happier with these headphones. I had purchased a set of more inexpensive Sony mdr-if240rk headphones earlier that had an unbearable amount of noise when using them on my 50\\"" Panasonic plasma flat screen. When I tried the Sony headphones on my 46\\"" Vizio lcd, they worked just fine. Having had such a good experience with Amazon in the past, I knew that if I ordered the Sennheiser headphones for my Panasonic and had the same problems with noise that they would take them back. Even though the Sennheiser's cost a bit more than the Sony's I went ahead and ordered them. The sound quality and separation is amazing. Watching the World Series on the 50\\"" is just like being there. You can literally hear the people on either side of you as if you were there. Sennheiser has a great product and Amazon as always is a super merchant!"
R2HKLL4LJ5P3I4,5,"I love them.  What I like best is the engioneering genius that whet into the design.  There are no batteries to replace. Since it recharges while sitting in it's storage cradle, there are no plugs to plug in.  When you are finished using them, you simply replace them in their storage cradle, and the storage cradle doubles as the transmission antenna.  The sound is good, although I don't demand or are able to detect perfect sound. I'm happy with the sound quality.  The earpieces are a bit hard, made of firm foam rubber, and become uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them. Sometimes I will use them for 8 to 10 hours straight without the two AAA size rechargable batteries become weak.  After that I put them on their cradle and go to bed.  You don't have to worry about over charging them, so you can just leave them on the recharging cradle until you are ready to use them again.  Because of the brilliant design I have no idea how long one can go without recharging them.   While they advertise around 250 feet transmission distance, I start picking up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter. The tacktic of changing between the three transmission frequiences doesn't make any difference on that, all three frequencies pick up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter."
RTGI6G51QJ495,5,"My daughter and I are on a regular dayshift schedule while our roommate works a graveyard shift.  The roommate's bedroom also happens to be immediately adjacent to the family room where the entertainment center is, complete with a television and video game system.  The sound of either one penetrates the hollow interior doors constantly waking our friend throughout the day.  But not any more...  When the headphones arrived, I immediately put the supplied batteries into the headphones and plugged the unit into an outlet to start charging.  This is accomplished by setting the headphones onto the base.  No need for \\""snapping\\"" anything in or trying to align charging points.  SO easy!  Connecting the transmitter base to the TV involved 2 colored plugs.  So easy a caveman could do it?    Yesterday, the rugrat spent a good chunk of the day watching movies and utilizing the headphones, even walking across the house to her bedroom with the headphones.  No hissing and no loss of signal.  When our friend awoke, she hadn't been bothered one bit and finally got restful sleep.  She's VERY appreciative of the purchase as are we.  No more are we straining to hear the television as it's turned way down so the roommate isn't disturbed.  Note: The volume on our TV can be muted or have the volume turned up and the headphones function regardless - no issues at all.)  The only thing left to do is buy another set of headphones so my daughter and I can listen at the same time."
R3TAAQWZNKMXQ4,4,"Very nice sound quality, convenient placement of controls and easy recharge. The headset doesn't size down enough and better suited for larger heads."
R1GQGMFT32X31H,1,"Absolutely terrible sound quality -- constant hiss, frequent pops and static, basically takes my CDs and makes them sound like beat-up old LPs broadcast on a cheap radio. I wish I'd sent it back when I still had the chance."
R1I26C0ZLBUE0Y,5,"I had a pair of these headphones before and they were very good but after a few years of use and abuse the sound quality started to decline, i decided to replace and the rechargeable ones were now availible. The new ones are very comfortable easy to use and again the quality is great, then as an added bonus the orginal headphones work in conjunction with the new pair so other ppl in the house can also use. All in all i am extremly happy with this product 5 star all the way"
R3QED0HIQJN6QF,4,"Good wireless phones; somewhat heavy, but to be expected (with rechargeable batteries, receiver, etc.  Good tonal response.  These are RF, not IR: little interference, no need for \\""line-of-sight\\""; Excellent range: get reception anywhere in or out of house.  Good length of time on one charge: have never drained batteries.  Bought a second set: one for TV in living room, one for music everywhere else."
R130J8JC7WEPRB,5,"The article arrived in time.It worked well,had good sound that can be heard throughout the house.It would have been nice if it came with its own battery charger."
R1P8F0HWDS2UK4,4,"My old Sennhesiser wireless headphones died after bout 10 years of use.  I tried replacing them with other brands, but did not like those for various reasons, so I bought these ones.  The controls, sound quality, and just abut everything else are the same as my old ones.  It is a fine product.  The big difference is that the old headphones fit around the ears, not on them like these replacements.  This has not noticeably affected the sound quality, but it makes them very easy to fall off if you walk around with them and lean over.  Sennheiser may still make an around the ears model.  If they do, get those."
RT2A4Y5PL1EX4,1,"From the beginning I had problems with these headphones.  First, the left side was noticably louder than the right. However, I liked the phones in other respects (comfy, good sound), so I kept them for another 4 months.   Then, a new problem appeared that I could not ignore: the left side developed a loud BUZZ.    No way could I continue to use these.  I returned them to Amazon for a [partial] refund.  I did not want another set.  I'll probably try SONY next."
R20R5E0RFK0HV1,5,"I have a recording studio in my home for the last 20 years and so sound is VERY important with me...and I do have hearing issues.  These headphones have blown me away.  I don't know how much better the higher price versions could sound, but after reading other reviews took at chance on these.  don't delay for a moment!!  The quality of sound and the distance from source are amazing!  I can put on satellite music channels and go way outside and rake leaves or sit in the hot tub.  Being able to hear all of the nuances of Blackhawk hockey games has me wearing them all the time now.  And of course my wife down't have to shut her door to the bedroom any longer.  If she's happy...everything is better eh?  Don't delay...get em' NOW!"
R2ID5OWP381O9L,5,"From the very first time of holding the wireless headphone, I could tell it is the excellently built product.  It works right out of the box!  It would have been significantly better if the product had not been made in China even though design and engineering works were made in Germany.   It is even hard to see these types of jobs being outsourced to other countries in Asia nowadays.  That's one of the reasons why American people have had very challenging times to get their jobs back.  We've just happened to make other countries become richer and richer as we keep giving away our jobs!!!  Who should we blame for?"
R8O7VVV3PYSWD,5,"I just received the Sennheiser RS120 Headphones yesterday and I must say I am very impressed.  This is an outstanding value for the $65 I paid on Amazon.  I was concerned about static as I use them for watching TV but the static is minimal particularly if you turn the volume on the TV up and keep the volume on the headphones low.  Even then you may only hear static when there is a silent passage in the program.    They sound very good, nice bass and good tone quality.  They sound great for music too.  The RS120 is very comfortable to wear and the range covers my whole house easily.    I agree with comments that the tuning adjustment and the volume adjustment shouldn't be so close together but that is a minor point I can live with.  My recommendation is to buy them.  I don't think you will be disappointed, particularly considering the price.  These are a great value!"
R31RWOBYVDDJCB,4,"Like most people, I have used quite a few different headphones.  I also happen to be a bit particular about the sound quality.  This one sounds mediocre, certainly not deserving of the Sennheiser name.  But I gave it 4 stars, despite the mediocre sound (which is quite acceptable for television watching) because it looks good, works well, has an excellent range.  I would buy it again.  As others have noted, the headphones are large and they are loose around my head.  Maybe my head is just small but probably not as all other headphones I have used fit me just fine.  So be aware that it will be loose, but you will likely enjoy it."
R31UHF6NJRXKMC,5,These are well worth the price. I can hear the words on TV without having to crank up the volume. I recommend these.
R3FH9RQEOCO703,2,"They arrived in 2 days. I've used this brand before and bought a pair from Amazon a few years a ago for my Grandmother. I'm not sure what modle I bought her but whatever model it was, it was a lot better quality in sound and the foam padding was better. Grandma's modle was also about $100.  This modle kind of sucks! The foam padding is poor quality. The bass is too low if you're not able to adjust it with an equalizer. The treble is too high. Overall, they do sound ok in certain aspects. There's not a comforable feel around your ears in the sense your ears are totally encompassed providing a encompassing sound.  I wish I would've payed twice the price and bought their better modle but I couldn't afford that expense at the moment.   They are good if you live in an apartment and you like to turn the TV or Stereo up after a certain time of night. The sound quality should be better than it is for the amount of money you're spending. I think think the price covers the fact that they are wireless and rechargable but thats it ... the price doesn't cover a better sound as you would get from a headphone that isn't wireless.    So do I think they are worth it? No! I would've rather waited, saved more money and bought the better modle or bought something that wasn't wireless. Will I return them? No, because I can't justify spending over $100 on headphones right now but I would if I could afford it.  So I suggest forget about these headphones if you're looking for a nice sound to the music you want to hear out of them. Buy them if they are for an elderly person who needs help hearing thier TV. Buy them if you're only using them for TV and want wireless. Do not buy them if you want to hear quality music.  UPDATE!  I originally bought these for my 11 year old as a Christmas Present as he is a \\""Gamer\\"". Because he lives 3500 miles away, I usually make sure the things I send him work. I also wanted a pair to listen to music and tried these out for another future purchase. I've triedthese out a few times over the past 3 weeks to see how they work and the quality you get from listening to music (Hendrix/Clapton/Albert King/SRV/Marvin Gaye/Dylan/Marley/McCartney/etc. in my case) are extremely poor. I would not buy them again for ANY reason! I do think they will work out well for a 11 year old \\""gamer\\"" as the volume isn;t so high where it will damage my 11 year old ears. These are not headphones you can enjoy great music with as the speakers can't handle mild bass at all. Turning them up all they way isn't very loud but causes them to distort. Again, with this in mind, a youngster wouldn't want to turn them up all the way because it would sound like crap! Using them for TV and gaming seems to be ok for a wireless headphone."
R3P7SMQ5MX6IF,3,"I bought this for watching the TV. The sound quality is amazing. I like the head set overall. The only problem is, you have to tune every time you power on the headset. It will not save the frequency once you set it.  Good for those who want to watch TV or play games with best sound."
R3STMIOTJS9PMV,5,"These Sennheiser  phones are perfect for listening to TV sound without disturbing others. Contrary to some reviews of these and other wireless headphones, I found no problems with sound quality, no background noise and a range of at least 40 feet with no signal distortion. I like the fact that the phones use standard rechargeable AA batteries that are easily replaced. I also found the recharging cradle convenient and easy to use. All in all I and very pleased with these headphones."
RATHWQE2XKUA4,5,"I mainly wanted headphones so that I could watch TV in bed without disturbing my wife.  These are great.  Plug the audio into the TV, plug the power in to the base, let it charge and you're good to go.  You can fine tune the audio signal which is nice.  I can listen at a very comfortable volume and my wife can't hear a thing...Love it"
R2U13G8OURMNN9,4,Good product. The recharging station is a very good idea. Headphones are comfortable and adjustable. Best of all I can walk around the house and hear my favorite shows while the TV is on mute. I should have bought these years ago.
REXL0J36SL1AK,5,I really like them. They were easy to install and work really well. I hear things now I never heard before. Quality is great.
RE44TIFZHRF4I,4,"I bought this product a few months ago and have enjoyed it very much ever since. Clear sound quality, about what you would expect from a Sennheiser product. One thing I am a bit disappointed with is its very minimalistic set of instructions/user manual. I just wish Sennheiser had made more of an effort to give clearer, more user-friendly instructions that a lousy piece of paper with fine-print like instructions.  But hey, I'm being nitpicky. I HIGHLY recommend this headset."
ROCVI78YBU461,4,"Upon many hours of trying to get these headphones to work I failed at it. I called the tech support for my brand of large screen TV. I was told my the tech support almost none of the larger, new and plasma TV cannot use these headphones. The reason being they only have a audio in and no audio out. There are a few that can use them but you must have a SPDIF Digial Optical Audio Cable. So before you purchase these please check with your tech support for the brand of large screen TV you have. But there was hope they do connect to your CABLE/DVR/BLU-RAY and DVD boxes. I inwhich connected to my blue ray player and they sound great that is really what I needed them for. All sellers should tell the consumer this before they make their purchase. I am happy now that I can use these but went through many hours of fustration. So be careful in what type of wireless headphones you choose !!!!"
R1XE09QCKSD7GO,4,I am a college student with a roommate who is in the ROTC program which means he often goes to bed early while I stay up later. I was skeptical when I was looking at these headphones becuase of their low price but I am glad I decided to buy them. These headphones are a great option for those who enjoy watching tv or playing video games but want to do so quietly. Before I got these I had been using my bose quiet comfort 15s but that was a pain becuse I had to sit right in front of the TV so I could plug them in. These make for a great alternative becuase I am not limited to one spot anymore which lets me move around my dorm while the sound quality remains great the entire time. I was most impressed with the charging dock that comes with the headphones. It's a really cool design that I wouldn't normally expect from a pair of 60 dollar headphones. The only real negative thing I can say about them is that they don't sit very firmly on my head. I have a pretty big head and I adjusted the headphones as small as they go but when I move my head around they slide around pretty easily. This isn't a big deal though and overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
R3CFY871TBP6DZ,5,I found that the earphones worked perfectly with no interference and have a very wide listening area. I can be outside at my barbecue grill and still hear the TV. A great product.
R2U2J3MBHBMNHG,5,"First of all I've tried many headphones but this is my first wireless ones.I LOVE them. I live in a apartment with paper thin walls and the neighbors complained about my loud tv.Not anymore.The sound is better then from my home system.I was amazed at the bass as well as the high ends.   Vey comfortable and I can wear them for hours.  The only downside is they cut off after about five minutes of silence,but with all the upsides I can live with that.   A good product for the price,you can't go wrong with these.   I give them 5 stars."
RGHS0APBB60AY,4,"Like many wireless headsets, the sound quality coming out of these isn't anything to write home about. But I didn't buy these for their sound quality, I got them for their convenience. They are incredibly convenient. Just pick them up off the stand, pop them on your head, and you're good to go. Once you're done using them you just place them back on the stand and they recharge. Very simple to use.<br /><br />There are a couple little oddities about these that Sennheiser could improve upon. First is the fact that the volume control and tuning knob are too close, and it's easy to accidentally knock the headset out of tune when you just want to adjust the volume. Seems like a major oversight. Next is the fact that they're a little difficult to set up, what with the channel selection and the tuning knob and whatnot. It would have been nice if the headset and the base just synced up automatically, but maybe that would add too much to the cost. Finally, if you stop sending an audio signal into the base (i.e. you pause the movie), eventually these things will start blaring static, and then they will eventually turn off. Not a big deal but it can be a minor annoyance.<br /><br />We use these headphones while the kids are sleeping, and I think their quality to price ratio is just about perfect. Just bear in mind that their sound quality is acceptable but they're not going to sound anywhere near as good as any of the high-end Sennheiser headphones."
R2MTW1ALM9ZEYH,3,"I live in a tiny apartment so range isn't really an issue. These headphones work acceptably well, but I do get a strange digital interference sound sometimes, especially when there's silence on the TV. It's not the worst problem in the world, but for a pair of headphones at this price I would have preferred a bit better sound quality and fidelity.   Also, I'm not sure I understand why headphones need to be so bulky. We can fit entire computers into phones, I feel like we should be able to make a sleeker, more comfortable pair of headphones.  Overall, you can do much worse, but for the price you might be able to do a little better."
RLPGP4AL6YEGS,5,Great Wireless Headphones. Only had for a month but working great.  Now I can use my Schwinn exerciser at any speed and still hear the tv. I can also take a break and go upstairs and still listen to what's going on on the tv while I get more water or whatever.  I would recommend unit as it works great for me.
R1P8B6P1CMS7YI,5,"great set of headphones. works great for video games, i hear stuff in my games i didnt before. cant beat this deal for the money. i would tell anybody to get these for the night owls in your house. my wife gets to sleep without yelling at me to turn the tv down"
R39NOEKV8H0WDC,2,"My trusty wired Sony headphones of 15 years finally died after someone rolled over the cord with a chair with wheels... I only use the headphones for practicing digital piano at night. During the day I use my [[ASIN:B000K69UW8 JBL LSR4328P Powered Studio Monitors (8 Inch, 220 Watts)]], which is awesome.   After looking around for a budget friendly but highly recommended wireless (knowing that wired sounds better, but for the ease of just being able to walk around tempted me), I chose the Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headphones. It did have mixed reviews, but most were positive, so I went ahead and ordered it.   It's a simple and solid design with on/off switch, volume control, and tuning control. When done using it, just put it back on the cradle and you don't have to plug in anything. It fits pretty well, but sudden movements are not recommended, as it will surely fall of the head.   After charging it overnight on its cradle, I was excited to use it. Well, it's pretty obvious when it's not in the right frequency, so it's easy to find that one small area where it's the \\""sweet spot.\\"" Except, even the sweet spot was not so sweet. There's whole lot of static noise and it's very distracting when I am trying to think while playing. When I am playing forte, it's as if the headphone's trying to protect my ears, it muffles the sound and no matter how hard I pound on the keys, it feeds no more than mezzo piano. It comes back to normal volume after a loooong while of playing really softly or nothing. It's very strange.   I am only keeping it around for when I absolutely need wireless headphones and am about to search for a new wired headphones."
R24NFUQWB448XJ,5,These work well in our bedroom to prevent disturbing others with late night t.v.  Straight forward setup and operation as well
R2Q46M8OROQKN9,5,"This product is as good as they get. Not the most expensive but certainly the top level of quality. Easy to use, basically plug in and go. The vendor delivered right away in a strong package. If this is an idea you've been looking for, this is a good product to buy"
R37RI4EC6NPSTC,4,The purpose of the buy was for my father-in-law who suffer a stroke and lost 90% of his hearing shortly after.  We bought it as an experiment to see if he would be able to listen to the TV without the volume of the TV set being at maximum volume.  It works great for that purpose and he is able to at least watch some TV programs that he always enjoyed....
R23B6FHR1HV4Z2,5,Excellent product but instruction sheet was not well written.  Sennheiser wireless ear phones are much better than TV EARS which failed after a short time.
R3Q3R3OCTOVLBG,3,"The set up was easy, the sound quality was very good but these earphones leak a lot of sound.  The outside of the earcups are ventilated (I assume to keep the batteries and electronics housed in the earphones cool) and a lot of sound escaped even when I turned down the volume way down.  These would be great if you are trying not to disturb someone in a different room, but if you plan to use them in the same room with someone else in there, you will definitely get complaints. Sorry, but I am using Amazon's great return policy to send these back."
RZ2ZCWMONF04R,4,Sound quality is great. The main problem I have noticed is they will slide off of your head if you have short hair and you lower your head. They do not slide off my wife's head since her hair prevents them from sliding. The other problem is static if you walk very far from the transmitter or turn a corner to go into another room.  I would rate them a 5 if it did not have these two problems. The sound quality is a strong 5. Charging the battery is a breeze with the cradle feature to hang your phones on. You can't beat these phones for the price.
R3LC2O9707LZJH,4,A little expensive but worth it.  They are very comfortable and the sound is very clear.  They have a tuning option that helps to keep the sound clear
R1IBKR4S96MY6F,5,"Now I can enjoy my favorite shows on TV without disturbing anyone in house during the midnight. Very comfortable to wear (I put it on for hours and have no issue with it on), much better sound than TV (my  TV is a high-end Sony  Bravia TV).  Automatically charging when not in use, very convenient. I use Sennheiser products for many years, they never failed me."
R1737KSYWALLFK,4,"I was looking for headphones that I can wear when I exercise and found this. The price was great and when I used it, the sound quality is great too. I have no complaints in that area. The only issue was it is really warm on my ears.   Overall, I've had it for two years now and it is still working like new. I love this product and recommend this to anybody wanting to save but will not compromise on quality."
R1R99TELA58LFB,4,"Biggest problem I had is my bedroom tv is so far away from my bed.  The wife was upset cause I would need to turn it up too loud and it was keeping her awake.  Bought these after reading several reviews on this and other products.  Do not pass these up just because they cost $10-$20 more than others that claim to do the same thing.  You'll be happy you spent the extra money.   Setup is very simple.  I have a newer tv so there's a rca audio out. Plugged right into that, plugged them in and put the headset on.  You'll need to tweak the bottom dial on the right ear to get the audio, but once it's tuned in you're set.  I've only needed to dial it in 1 other time, but that's only because someone else messed with the dial.   Avg watch time is around 1-2hr. I'll leave it off the charging stand for a couple days and they still have plenty of juice.  Recharging is so simple...just put the headphones on the cradle.  The cradle does mount to the wall."
R2JAOR7PYI3LZ1,5,I can not believe that for around 60 dollars you can get so much sophisticated electronic entertainment for your money. I will also let sennheiser headphones corporate know how pleased I am of their outstanding cordless headphones.
ROSI0MGKR5J3L,2,"I am getting a lot of background noise. I would expect to have close to zero static sound when I minimize the input volume but this is not true with these headphones.   More than that, low frequencies are not so powerful, high frequencies are not so sharp."
R109AU6F313B4Q,1,"Terrible reception, only get sound out of the right side.  I changed batteries moved it to another TV still does not work properly. If I would have saved the packaging instead of throwing it away immidiately I would have returned it!!!! My cheap RCA's that I was replacing are still better than this one..."
R34DRVZP7SBNL6,1,"Sennheiser is supposed to be a top brand in this type of equipment and since my hearing is not that good anymore, I thought that this would be the solution. This set worked great for the first week, from that point, I don't get anything but static, and was unable to \\""tune\\"" them.  The headset doesn't fit correctly into the charging stand and misses the contacts to keep it charged, and it required constant adjustment or the batteries wouldn't charge. I recently tried to switch to regular batteries, but with the same results...static.<br /><br />My wife threw out the packing, when it first came in so I couldn't send this purchase back.  It's about the worst $80 purchase I've ever made, and my wife is getting tired of me always asking \\""what did they say?\\"""
R1BJ04XPMLMDXU,3,"I really liked almost everything about this unit. The sound is terrific. I needed this because of a hearing loss and my wife was tired of the high volume I needed to hear the TV, and sometimes I watch when she is in bed.  I was able to hear things I had clearly been missing before. Top quality sound. The recharging is so easy, just put it on the cradle and it recharges the nimh batteries, no memory, AA, very good and replaceable.  And great range. Worked all over the house and even into my yard.  I really liked almost everything about it--except it wouldn't stay on my head. If I got up it fell off. If I changed my position on my chair it fell off.  After the umteenth time I tried to save it from going on the floor and split my lip in the process.  If only it would stay on.  I want to get a better one from this manufacturer because of all the good things about it. Maybe a different model has a better ear piece, maybe that fits around the ear instead of a flat piece of foam that fits on the ear and slides off all too easily.  Hard to return, but it has to be useful, and this just wasn't. I would quit using it because of this.  Sorry, I hope the model up is better because I want it for all the great qualities, except for the ear piece."
R2OM732UFZV7XH,4,Works well except in power failure i have to unplug the cradle and replug it to work. Kind of a pain.
R291X8N5L7CK3Z,2,"Sennheiser products have always been synonomous with quality but I take exception to the cheap construction of these headphones.  When you move your head the slightest little bit, the part that goes on top of your head creaks loudly.  They even creak when I clench my jaw during suspensful scenes.  The actual sound quality is good but the constant loud creaking is a pain in the neck.  The batteries hold a charge well and the charger works well.    They still work perfectly well after several years but they have been retired to my junk closet due to the intolerable creaking noises."
R1E4F3Y1GXHC6J,5,"I have used sennheiser remote headphones for over 10 years and I find them to be a excellent product,they are reliable ,comfortable and the sound is out of this world. Amazon is very smart to carry a product like these phones.I would recommend them to anyone wanting a little better sound when watching TV or just listening to music ."
R2XWNR2VLA3FWF,5,Product worked better than I anticipated.  I had a set of headphones when they were first came to  market and had to return them because of poor quality.  These set exceeded my expectations.
R2F47K1NUH6PKY,2,"When shopping around for wireless headphones, one of the biggest complaints was the range of signal. Before I wrote this review I wanted to test that. I walked upstairs, passed brick, wood, tile, a thick glass sliding door and walked all the way to the far corner our double lot property before I heard any static start to ease in. Realistically, I could mow the lawn or shovel snow wearing these and that's not even the reason I bought them! And for 50 bucks!  I noticed a bit of static when I first put them on and thought, \\""Oh, well there's that static everyone's talking about.\\"" Then I turned on some music, and nearly blew my eardrums out. The static only exists when the volume is deafening. I ran a test. I turned the headphones to the exact point where the static disappears. When I turned on my music, it was still much louder than I would probably ever listen to it. Just make sure you turn your computer or TV all the way up, and use the volume knob on the headphones to turn it down to minimize any static.  The volume and the frequency knobs are right next to each other and feel identical, so unless you've mastered the feel of the headphones, you'll probably have to double check which knob you're touching. It wouldn't have taken much effort, time, or thought to put one of the knobs on the other headphone or make one smaller or different in texture, or just space them farther apart. It's a stupid design flaw, and it wouldn't really matter if it weren't so easy to have fixed. It doesn't change my idea of the headphones. It just makes me think someone dropped the ball at Sennheiser.  They are EXTREMELY comfortable. Easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. The pads are a soft fuzzy material so you don't get sweaty-leather-ear. They feel like extremely comfortable ear-muffs. They're just heavy enough to feel nice and sturdy on your head. The earphones themselves are large and flat against your ear, but they don't squeeze against your ears and make them sore,even after 10 hours of use. If there is any complaint about the form of them, sometimes I feel like they could fall off. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with these, and I plan on linking everyone at work to this amazon page.  UPDATE:  After using the headphones for a few days at work, I have run into some problems. First and most importantly, these do not keep the sound in at all. I was listening to an audiobook at a reasonable volume and the coworkers around me could hear it clearly. This is a huge problem if you're a person who doesn't want to disturb others. Listening to music with distinct sounds, like hi-hats or high-pitched instruments can be heard by those around you very clearly.  Secondly, there is an issue with the auto-off feature. If no sound enters the headphones for about a minute or two, the signal is cut off and static fills the headphones. The solution is to develop a couple habits. Whenever you are not listening to audio, shut the headphones off. And if you forget and the headphones auto-shut off, you must turn them off until you plan on listening to audio again. If you just turn the audio back on when the static is playing, the headphones will take a second turn on. It's annoying, and a maddeningly stupid design choice, but not entirely debilitating.   Thirdly, they do not keep sound out at all. Unless I blare my music, everything in the office can be heard as clearly as if nothing was on my ears at all. This may be a selling point for some people who dislike being deaf to outside sound. Nobody will have to try to get your attention twice. You'll hear them the first time.  I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars during this update.  UPDATE: 10.20.2011  The volume knob grows more annoying as time goes on. Once you're used to the headphones, you want to notice them less, and just hear the audio, but when you have to take your right hand off of the mouse in order to change the volume, this grows annoying, I often reach up with my left hand to change thevolume just because it would feel so much more natural that way. Left handers have nothing to worry about. Another, easily fixed, stupid design choice by Sennheiser.  The problem with the headphones being loose and falling off has proved to be more of a factor than I originally thought. I often have to hold onto the headphones when picking something up or if I plan to move quickly. It seems more and more like these headphones were not made with computer use in mind. Watching movies is a more stationary activity and would probably be better suited to these headphones.  During this update I have changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  UPDATE: 11.23.2011  This will be my final update, because I am replacing these headphones with a usable pair. The sound blasts outward from the headphones louder than they do inside them. I literally cannot listen to them at work at even 10% volume without workmates asking me to turn them down. On the sides of the headphones, it looks as if there are actual speakers projecting out. This, coupled with the fact that they do not cancel a single decibel of sound, makes them useless as a pair of headphones. They might as well be a set of desktop speakers that you wear on your head.  I have lowered my rating to 2 stars this update."
R1QN1AATUTTQVM,5,"Hi,   Brief:   i bought this set last week with the charging cradle bent/leaning  towards right and i had lot of Hiss even though i turned the set in many configurations. Great news for all previous and future buyers is that i was able to troubleshoot the \\""HiSS\\"" issue. When you connect left and right pins into your source (in my case, it's a computer), everything looked fine , i see green light on the base unit but i was getting frequent 'communication gaps/ \\""HiSS\\"" / noises' etc...   Issue:  Problem here is you don't see the actual communication gaps because the Green light on base unit lights and misleading even if you loose connection on one of the the left or right pins.  Solution:  To get avoid this, use the 2 to 1 pin they supplied and plug it into head phones socket of the source and i guarantee that you never will see any communication gap anymore. I tested this set 9 homes left to right of my home, back yard, basement and eveywhere without a \\""HiSS\\"".   Summary:  I used this set for few weeks and i am revising my review. This is a great set but i have a little comment, headphones are too big and the really don't sit on my head. I read people saying they used these headphone for lawn mowing etc but i don't think i can do that because the head phones are not snug fit to the ears. You can use these phones for other activities in the garden, basement or enywhere without any problem.  I hope this will help the Amazon customers who use these headphones.  Thanks  Sen120"
R1WT0KP305AQ9N,5,"Unless tuning the tv so high that it bothered everyone else is the Sennheiser the absolute winner.  The sound quality is excellent, the basses, the midrange and the high end deliver the utmost in quality.  One can enjoy music and/or the spoken word again the way it was supposed to be enjoyed.  The tuning control is a little sensative and could be better."
R1WIAEVT7LA94V,1,I bought these for my husband so he could watch TV in bed without disturbing me. After charging the headphones there was extreme static and interference and the TV was only about 12 feet away from where he was laying in the bed. No matter what we tried we could not get rid of the static. He also commented that the headphones fit okay. I should have put more time into researching before purchasing. I did return the item to Amazon and within 1 week was issued a refund.
R165JT0Z64YAED,5,"I was a little skeptical of these headphones, fully prepared to return them if they didn't work, because a lot of people seemed to have trouble with them, However they are just plain amazing. The only issue I had was the setup, which was a little difficult, but any tech saavy person should be able to figure out. The issue was with the instructions which were fairly vague. I just got my little brother to walk me through the set-up and now I can't live with out them. The most amazing feature of this set of wireless headphones is the range...they worked about two hundred feet away from my house before they started crackling. All in all this is a wonderful set of headphones well worth the price and my girlfriend can sleep while I stay up late and watch a movie or play video games, it has gotten to the point that I would rather use the headphones when using the T.v. during the day rather than our speaker system. I would recommend this set of Sennheiser headphones to anyone who can drop a hundred bucks."
R1VQKVWWFNBGUL,4,They work great. does not bother my wife when she sleeps. can listen from any room in the house.Even the bothroom.  [[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]
R2M8FQMMAK38DA,4,"Got these 3 years ago when I was caring for my elderly father because he liked to sit up all night in his recliner with the TV going full blast.  Unfortunately this interfered with my sleep.  So I convinced him to use these.  He did use them for awhile, but there was something funny about the way you had to turn it on that made it easy for my dad to accidentally detune it.  The knobs were too close together and not well labeled, as I recall.  I don't have it anymore but I guess the simple solution would have been to remove the tuning knob and cover it up with electrical tape.  Of course then you could never tune it again ...<br /><br />So while it seems like the perfect solution for this situation, it was only pretty good.<br /><br />I'd give it a 4 despite that."
R2S39WZ4NPPTXI,5,"I live in a noisy house. I have a 2 and 4 year old who love to chase each other and squeal with delight, and when I'm preparing a meal, I have a loud overhead fan over my stove. The combination of these noises would completely drown out the TV, which I like to listen to while I'm cooking or cleaning for that matter. Turning up the TV really, really loud was my only option, but the noise would just be extremely loud on everyone. I decided to look for a set of wireless headphones that I could move about and do what I had to do in the house, but still be able to hear the kids and not have to blast the TV so loud. I found these Sennheisers, and thought they'd be perfect. My husband thought it was a waste of money... at first!   I started wearing the headphones on Saturday mornings, when the hubby wants to sleep in while I cook breakfast for the kids. Now I can listen to Project Runway wherever I am in the house! Then, when the kids take a nap, my husband now uses them to watch football on Sundays so he can have the full sound without waking them up, AND he can run out to the garage and do household tasks without missing a thing!   The quality is very good, though we do have to tweak volume levels to avoid a \\""hiss\\"" that comes with turning up the headset too high when the TV volume is set too low, but that's not any big deal at all. The headphones are comfortable to wear, and setting them on the cradle to charge is a breeze! I just wish we hadn't accidentally closed our TV hutch door on the wire, which caused a cut in the wire. The wire is permanently attached to the headset cradle, so there is no replacing the wire without replacing the cradle, so that sucks, but I did a fix with some electrical tape and some scissors. Hope it lasts.   Bottom line: a GREAT find at a really reasonable price. Thanks!"
R3POSQXO84JNI2,4,"Going on my second set in 5 years as the right speaker just gave out. I would give these a 5-star rating except for the comfort/fit. They do not fit securely on the head when walking or bending over as slippage will occur. No problem when remaining still in a chair. I've had other headphones that are more comfortable, but the RS120s do ok. As for the positives, nice clean, sharp sound with good separation. Good reception from different parts of the house, but no more than two rooms away. The headphones are a great bargain, high quality, reliable, and easy to setup straight from the box. Mine are used exclusively for TV viewing. Highly recommended."
RJ2YTAWKBEJJ5,5,"I'm using it on a treadmill, and it's working great 6 feet or less away from a laptop using wireless internet, a wii and a flat-screen TV. That's a lot of potential distortion, and I notice none when there is sound playing. There is a minor quantity of swirling reception noise when there is no sound signal, but it is quiet enough. The unit will disconnect from audio source if headset turned off or the sound signal is interrupted long enough, and there is a hiss noise then (but it's not loud). When the sound signal returns the headset kicks in and it's all back to normal.  I'm very satisfied with the unit, and with the volume level. My Dad just bought a Sony equivalent which is very nice, but the maximum volume level was much lower than this model (as far as I can tell)."
R1QP4P28ABEND9,5,"Bought two pair a year and half ago so my wife and I can watch TV together without disturbing the kids.  Worked great, so just bought 2 more for downstairs."
R29HA2GJJO4GNV,3,"These headphones produce very good sound at good range from the cradle.  There is a background hiss at all times, but it's only audible at very low volumes.  Also, these look like around-the-ear headphones, but there's no ear cup at all.  The ear pads sit flat on the ear, like smaller compact headphones, but because these are heavier, they tend to slide around if you tilt your head up or down.  At first this is only a small nuisance. After a while however, you begin adapting your movements to compensate for it -- just like you might compensate for the wire on standard headphones. When you realize you're doing that, you have to wonder why you bought wireless in the first place.  Finally, these headphones have a flimsy on/off switch on the left ear pad.  Mine broke after four months, so I'm out.  I'm sold on wireless headphones, but not these.  My best advice is keep looking."
R3U18Y1U3G9CTC,5,"Comfortable to wear while exercising. Range is good, but haven't extended it outside 50 feet from its base. Good for noise blocking as well."
RWI3ZFVOB0KER,5,"I admit that I was very skeptical prior to purchasing these headphones.  I mean, good ones at this price?  Get real.  But seriously, they work like a dream.  It took a little help from my son to get it all hooked up right, but then... just wonderful.  My husband has a very expensive, but not wireless, headset from a well known brand and now he wants me to order another set of these for him."
R4IPQ4R479QW2,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]] The unit was deffective and would not play the music when I received it.  The problem that I fixed, and very simple to do, was the battery terminals were not tight enough to make a solid contact to the positive end of the batteries.  I'm a retired electrical engineer, and nothing to do the whole day that's why I tried to fix it rather than return it to Amazon.  I'm very satisfied with this headphones' stereo sound, and the low hissing sound is not present as soon as the music started.  It's a little heavy and bulky, and it will constantly slide downward whenever I bend down to pick up something on the floor.  I solved this problem that other users complained about.  I tied an old and clean shoelace at the back of the headhpones plastic bands, making sure that the slack is long enough to looop around the back of my head.  I hope Sennheiser will redesign this superb sounding headphones, and improve their quality control in China before they put their well known German brand name on this model of headphones.  One improvement could be a wider and thinner soft leather headband in place of the bulky and heavier plastic band with rubber foams."
R1OYO2TARZA55H,3,"I'm not sure if the unit I received was defective, but the ability to hold a decent signal was bordering on zero.  I was at a range of less than 10 feet and would pick up random noise, interference, and squelching.  I tried all 3 channels, multiple locations for the base, all to no avail.  I would get a good tune, and a matter of minutes later lose it.      The headphones themselves are pretty decent.  Very little isolation, but they're comfortable and fit nice, with decent sound (in the rare instances I had a good signal).  Not too bad as far as ear sweat goes.  There's always a little hiss and occasional noise, but it's not really intrusive.  If you need perfect sound and no noise, get something with wires.    EDIT: I moved the transmitter to a different room and I'm able to get a good signal almost anywhere else in my house.  I guess my bedroom, where these were intended for, is incompatible with RF devices.  I'm not sure if higher frequencies, better tuning options, or what other changes would make them work in that environment.  But I can't really give the product any better than a 3 star rating."
RTM3NP5AQ4KYS,3,This headset is not nearly as comfortable as the Orginal and is almost impossible to wear for any lenght of time.
R3SWXKRRU4DOCQ,4,"Every thing is worthy with US$80. Regret of sweaty ear, it could not turn around to cover confortablely the ears. The headphone fall down when stooping to pickup something. I had replaced the good one from JVC feadphone! So far OK now. Of course, you will say to buy the more expensive could be better!"
R1RF0E6Y197ENV,1,"I purchased two sets of these wireless headphones on March 8, 2011 so my wife and I could watch TV without disturbing the other.  We don't use them very much (maybe 10 times for one set; about 3 times for the other.) Six months and three days later, kaput!  The bedroom set, which is the 10-use set, expired suddenly while in use.  After trying the \\""problem solving\\"" actions recommended by Sennheiser and using the other headset I determined that the transmitter suffered some kind of major malfunction.  Both headsets continue to work with the other transmitter.      So I'm giving this product one star for two reasons: one, six months of occasional use should not result in a total breakdown of a product with a 2-year warranty.  Second, when you start looking to see how to use the warranty, you discover that there is no U.S. 800# nor even a contact address in this country, much less any guidance on how to receive warranty service.  The only manufacturer info is in Germany with a German telephone #.  This is less than one-star customer service but you cannot give zero stars in this rating system.    I'm going to try the U.S. seller of this product (fulfilled through Amazon) so stay tuned for a follow-up review."
R1TEATQEX5DI0F,1,"After using the RS120 for a few weeks I just couldn't use them anymore. Reasons are that I wasn't thrilled with the lack of bass, volume levels and interference issues. My ears also hurt after a short time due to the way the ear pads are made.     Ended up purchasing the RS180 model. Very much worth the additional cost."
R26HOZU0XT9M06,5,"After reviewing many different headphones in this price range I went with the RS120 and couldn't be happier! I have used it several times while on my treadmill and it does a great job of blocking out everything but what I am listening to. I will note that you couldn\\""t use this product if you are moving your head around but for simply running on the treadmill or riding a bike it is absolutely wonderful!"
R3FL1S9BRR7Q4V,2,"I needed headphones for the office and after reading the reviews decided on this pair.  After trying these out for just a couple hours I knew they were not for me for a couple reasons.      1.)  They were very warm.  The fabric from the headphones pushed against my ears and left no room for air so it made my ears hot and for me was uncomfortable (maybe my big ears made it worse)    2.)  Although the wireless feature is great, the downside is there is a humm in the background and if you want to leave the volume at a low level you can hear it.      3.)  The first 2 reasons were the main reason for my return ... there was one more downside for me:  I work in an office with many cubes and it is pretty quiet.  With these headphones set to the medium level, other employees could hear the music at their desk which would have been slightly annoying.    Also, I bought these figuring they would be kind of bulky and they deff are so buyer beware.  They looked even bigger on me than I expected which would have been fine if I didn't have the above issues.      Hope this helps!"
R2DTXEVBYD1X5K,4,"I use these RS 120's for listening to television. They have a good crisp clear sound, and seem to be pretty well made by todays standards. The battery life is very good and has never run down while in use.  I hear things in programs and movies that I never heard before and I don't have to turn the sound up so high that it disturbs others. I did see in other reviews that they have an echo if used while the TV speakers were on for listening for other people, but I have not noticed this being any problem with mine. I have used these for over a month with no problems. I would recommend them to anyone."
R1399HLU8LACAR,3,"The Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones work okay but they are pretty touchy.  I don't know if the issue is the audio out cable or the audio out jack but it takes a bit of patience to make the headphones work but once I did they work to my satisfaction.  The RS120 headphones are not extremely comfortable but they aren't uncomfortable either, they just are.  The wireless signal seems to depends on your position more than I would have liked.  While I can get up and walk around without normally losing the signal, there are times that a simple turn of the head causes the signal to drop. While I would not trust my life to the reliability of these headphones they work just fine not waking the family in the middle of the night when I can't sleep."
R12R5PDR43SD6C,5,"I use the headsets most every night.  My wife likes to go to bed early, and I like to stay up late, so now I can listen to the TV as loud as I want to.  Good quality.  No complaints."
R1I2Y0LLA3X8XR,1,"Returned the first one after the charging station wouldn't light up, couldn't retrieve any sound. Tried it on 3 different TV's and the same problem.  Returned it and received replacement, same problem.  Couldn't believe that both units didn't work. I couldn't believe that a company as renowned as Sennheiser would allow a defective product to enter the market.  Went to the Sennheiser website, described my problem and NEVER received a reply.  So much for customer service.  BTW, the products were made in China."
R3HIIGTILCBSLD,1,"I own other 3 wired headset from Sennheiser and one NoName/\\""cheep\\"" wireless headset.<br /><br />Being so happy with my other Sennheiser headsets I bought this product hoping to improve my  wireless experience but after one minute of use I was totally disappointed.<br /><br />Quality of sound and reception is really bad, i can't turn my head without losing reception and I can't go more fare then 5m away from my TV, a lot of background noise and the headset can't reproduce lower frequencies of sound.<br /><br />They are really uncomfortable, my ears hurts after use them and they got terrible hot and if I move fast my head the headsets fall down.<br /><br />Now I'm back to my old wireless headset which are much more better then this ones.<br /><br />Shame on you Sennheiser for this headsets!!!"
R10TAA46GGVQNF,5,"These wireless headphones have really great sound quality.  I had no connection direct from my new Plasma 46\\"" so I either connect thru the cable box or Bluray player.  Both work great and the unit automatically turns on when you start playback.  Charging cradle is great and seems to keep the batteries up.  Controls are somewhat small and awkward being little wheels on the ear pieces but are adequate once adjusted properly for your likes.  The headphones themselves are rather large and do expand for headsize variations but the earpieces themselves do not move in any direction which limits the way you can wear them.  I know they have lots of stuff inside the headphones but a smaller size would be really great and more comfortable.      All in all a great pair of headphones for the money."
RUJD7DMGXAL4J,2,"I have 10 different pairs of different Sennheiser headphones and they are all AWESOME.  I have owned the HDR130 for several years and they are outstanding.  I thought the only difference between these (HDR120) and the HDR130 was the surround sound feature.  Not so..... These are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears.  Rather than a frequency switch, these have a frequency dial.  Finally, the sound is OK at low volumes but distorts badly at mid to higher volumes. The sleep mode did not work either.  These may have been a defective set, but I really do not want to take the chance with another pair.  Back they go."
R3H4S9S5RXW89R,5,"I am very happy with my purchase of the Sennheiser RF wireless headphone. It is a nice product that does it's job and does it well. I know some people have complained about the buzz in background, but it is RF...that is going to happen every now and then. For the most part it is unnoticeable and does not cause a problem.     After an hour or so, the headphones start to cause a bit of a problem because I wear eyeglasses. It causes the earpieces to press too hard and it can be mildly annoying.     The folks who say they won't stay on your head if you bend over are correct but the simple solution is DON'T BEND OVER. Pretty easy...when I am using them, I am sitting in a chair, not doing a workout or crawling around under my desk.    I find the sound quality to be quite good...for the price, you will not find better.     Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and am thinking of getting another set for use at home."
R2K7T970W5TMPT,4,"With a hearing loss it is difficult to hear the TV. Even with aids in I still get asked to turn the sound down to a point that I can't understand what is being said. It sure is nice to hear the words again.  The sound quality is great. The base/charger unit is easy to connect. The headset is very comfortable even when worn for long periods of time. The headset will fall off when you lean forward sometimes but not a big deal, It's a small tradeoff for the longterm comfort I feel. Battery life has not been an issue, I just place them on the cradle for a fresh charge when I take them off. Range seems good, I've been all over the house and out in the yard with no problems. I would buy them again and would recommend to a friend."
RNYJDBU6U25JO,5,"I am very pleased with these headphones. I've been using them on 2 different TV's. I have used them with my PS3, and they work excellent. I've also been using them late at night when watching movies. It's nice to be able to enjoy a movie or game and not have to worry about waking your child up. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
RXRINMVFCDD28,4,"I have been through two pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones.  I have a pair of EH150s that I absolutely love, except for the cord.  So when I wanted wireless headphones, I immediately looked at Sennheisers.  I use these exclusively for TV and video games.  I don't listen to music with them.  I'm also not moving around a whole lot.  For me, the point of these is to play video games and watch TV at night and not have a wire running from the TV to the couch.  And for that, they do the job perfectly for the price.    As other reviewers have mentioned, the base station automatically detects when there is and isn't a signal and turns on and off accordingly.  Some people have said that the signal randomly cuts out during when what they're listening to is very quiet.  I have not had any issues with this for video games, even in very quiet parts of the game.  The auto-turnoff time with no signal is 3 minutes, which is very reasonable.  So I suppose if you're watching TV and you mute it during a really long commercial break, then yes, the headphones will turn off.  \\""Don't do that.\\""    Other people have mentioned hiss.  This was a problem for me when I initially set up the headphones, but it's easy to work around.  First, play with the tuning knob on the headphones until the signal is at its clearest.  Then, mute whatever you're listening to, and slowly turn down the volume on the headphones until you can no longer (or just barely) hear a hiss.  Then unmute your source, and turn its volume up until it's at the level you want.  Problem solved, no more miss.  I think people who complain about the hiss are turning the volume on the headphones way up instead of turning up whatever is plugged in to the headphones.    There are two things prevent me from giving it 5 stars:  - the connectors are RCA.  They include an RCA-> 1/8\\"" stereo adapter, and a 1/8\\"" to 1/4\\"" adapter, which is great, but is rather bulky sticking out of my receiver.  I'd rather have a 1/4\\"" plug, and adapters for 1/8\\"" and RCA.  - the headphones are not as comfortable as I'd like.  Don't get me wrong, they're great for what they are, but compared to me Sennheiser EH150, they're noticeably less comfortable.  I can wear the EH150s for hours and not feel like I have anything on my head at all.  It's not the weight or bulk of the wireless headphones, it's that the earpieces and covering fit less well and are less comfortable.  (And the EH150s were $20 headphones, so it's not like they were luxury items or anything)    Overall though, for the price, they're great and the best choice among similar brands in this price point."
R1U4TIE3ORNJ8M,5,"The Sennheiser wireless headphone system solved my problem. I was inflicted with a sudden hearing loss in both ears.  The TV sound was just a jumble of noise. After about a month of reading captions, I thought there must be a better way.  I ordered the Sennheiser wireless headset, RS 120. It arrived in less than a week. In great anticipation I unpacked it  and installed, following the simple instructions. To my surprise and joy, I could now understand the TV audio and did not  have to read the captions any longer. Since we have more than one TV, I ordered another unit. Now I can hear from either  TV. The inductive charging system works great. Just remember to turn the headset off when you hang it up for the night.  I found with one TV you can turn the TV sound way down and adjust the volume on the headset. Great if you don't want to disturb  the family if you listen to TV late at night. The other TV you need to have the TV volume at normal. Must be dependant where they connect  the audio out jack.  Now if I can just find somthing to assist with telephone conversation."
RY603K0PVNVHI,4,"This is an amazing product that i have come across. Great sound quality! Hissing sound that other reviews have talked about is there but i don't really feel (unless i tried to listen as reviews had talked about it) it as its really in the background but for those \\""daredevils\\"" with exceptional hearing ability, this might be it ;) Overall a good buy if one is looking for a good quality durable wireless speaker and would rather pay a bit more and get a good product than spend $20.00 six times a yr..."
R3F2O8RZGTZASA,5,"The Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headset is simply AWESOME.     Not 100% perfect though because I too find fault with the \\""loose fitting\\"" crappy headset design. However, the reason I bought them was to be able to hear TV dialog ------- and I sure as heck can hear once again!     My onlycomplaint is: The headsets are loosely fitted to the head and tend to move when one moves their head abruptly, the ear pads are not very comfortable---- but did I mentiom that I bought this item so I can hear TV????? Well I can hear my TV once again, mission accomplished.     My background: I am 72 year old retired Air Force AirCrew member and have been wearing good quality Phonex brand hearing aids for the past 6 or 7 years. As I age my hearing is getting worse. It seems to me that the somewhat \\""tinny\\"" sound that you get from the hearing aids coupled with the increased volume of the TV causes a \\""Mish Mash\\"" of over amplified audio that actually was obscuring the dialog making it hard to understand. ------------ NO PROBLEM NOW!!     I connected the wireless transmitter to the TV analog audio output, charged up the headset batteries , turned the headset on, tuned it up and WOW! WHAT I HAVE BEEN MISSING!     I now hear the TV dialog --loud and clear--- with bass sounding very good---- NO tinny sounds----- and perhaps the best news of all is that!  All is well in my den with no more \\""turn the TV down\\"" requests/demands from my wife of 50 years. The audio volume level that I set in my headset is independent of the level that she sets on the TV speakers! GREAT!     I do not have a hint of static or hiss when there is an audio signal present. Normally I am seated about 18 feet from my PLASMA tv (with no interference at all from the Plasma TV set as other reviewers stated might occur)     To test this device out I moved throughout my home with the headset on and have not experenced any static interference, no volume drop outs or anything less than a rock solid audio signal. While in the house Iwas up to 60 feet from the transmitter, and was receiving the signal through up to 4 sheet rocked walls!     I then moved outside my house and was able to receive a 100% perfect signal at my back yard fence that is approximately 120 feet from the TV set/Sennheiser transmitter unit.     AMAZING--- THIS IS NOT A TOY as are the other solutions such as \\""TV sound Enhancers, TV amplifiers, TV E-rs, and other Sound amplifiers offerings that I have tried in the past!     Oh yes (as a hint to other hearing aid wearers) I found that if I REMOVED my hearing aids when using the Sennheiser headset the QUALITY of the sound the tone, and bass etc. of the music, speech and all sounds in general was MUCH improved over using the hearing aids in conjunction with the Stennheiser headset!     Also, contrary to other reviews, the recharging function is simple and works great for me, I just place the headset on the transmitter base as suggested and it charges all the time/every time with no problem at all.     Am I pleased with this purchase? I am and will be buying another set for my bedroom soon.    Based upon my experience I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SENNHEISER Wireless headset model HDR/RS 120 !!!!!!     My best wishes and I wish you all good hearing!"
R3UOSJX11N0LNE,4,Ear phones certainly help reduce the sound level of the TV so my husband can hear it at his level and the whole neighborhood doesn't have to hear it also!    We have UVerse and Direct TV on the TV's used w/these ear phones. The instructions did NOT indicate that the connections should be installed in those boxes and NOT the TV.  It would have been helpful to have that information on the written material
R1141QIIPKNX85,4,"I was looking for headphones to wear so that my boyfriend could study in peace. The set up is extremely easy. It's not without it's glitches, however. I read the reviews before I bought this set and I can say I did experience some of the same issues other did when it came to the sound quality. Trying to tune these headphones so you get the best quality can drive you crazy. Once I get them just right I make sure not to touch the tuner so as not to lose the sound quality or I know I'm in for another hour of monekying around with the tuner dial while my ears are assaulted by the sound of snow and popping. I have done as others suggested and put the tv volume as loud as it can go, but I actually found that that didn't help as much as finding just the right tuner position on the headphones. Because of these headaches with the tuner position, I did take off one star.     It does have an auto-off, while convenient for some, if you happen to be using a DVR or instantly streaming off the net onto your tv, beware! I typically turn the headphones off if I have to pause the program or if I'm searching for something else to watch. The sound that comes out of the headphones once the base is turned off is loud and kind of startles you. My boyfriend was startled once it was so loud and I was the one wearing them!    The headphones themselves are pretty comfortable. These headphones are soft, but flat, which I thought was an odd design choice. I can wear them for hours with no discomfort though. If I don't bend my head forward, they do like to slip off, so wouldn't recommend to wear while doing housework. I'm wearing them right now while I write this review, so they're fine for that! ;-)    At the end of the day, I do like these headphones and I use them often. If I had paid the original retail price of over $100 I might not be so happy, but for only $60, they are a great deal!"
R2GFCHGBORQD7E,5,"I had tried a few wireless, RF and IR, headphones back in the day and had various issues, from line-of-sight, overall comfort, and most important quality of sound issues with all of them and they've been collecting dust in storage for a while. I recently began to get flack from my wife for playing games that ended up annoying her since she was in the room doing something else.      I opted for these Sennheiser headphones since I own other Sennheiser wired headphones and they work great. I got the RS120 headphones very quickly (Thanks Amazon!) after ordering it and was able to use the included NiMH batteries and immediately use it for about 3 hours of gaming. The quality of sound is great, the headphones are very comfortable. Hook up took just a couple of seconds.    I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones!"
R2VYGDLHENDJ1M,5,"These are my first wireless headphones. I am very pleased with the sound quality.  Very full and clear, better than my Plasma TV.  I often stay up later than my wife. Now I can watch TV without disturbing her. The charging base is slick. It has two metal arms that engage two metal pads on the headband. When I first tried the headset, it was in mono mode. I changed channels and readjusted the tuning on the earpiece. Beautiful stereo ever since."
RL0RTAS36AAGU,4,"Over all great performance.     A couple of simple questiones though.     1, I recently relocate to China and brought it with me and how do I get it work also in China? (do I need to buy a power adapter?)     2, If the cradle charger is non functional, where do I go for repair?"
R1JZPPN0CBC8E1,4,"I bought these for my dad, because he's tired of everybody talking too loudly in adjacent rooms, or the noise of the fans (we live in a hot climate, and are too cheap to run the A/C, and thus have two thousand fans circulating air to keep cool...), etc going on, combined probably with getting on in years, and the ears not co-operating so much.  That's the background (noise...hahahaha!) on my decision to purchase these.<br /><br />That context in mind, these are easily among his most favorite \\""recent\\"" additions to the toy box.  No longer must he turn up the TV volume to 4000% to drown out such trite dialogues between people not on TV (does this shirt make me look fat?, Do you smell smoke?, Should we call 911?, etc) and risk blowing the speakers.  Now, his technophobic rear end can comfortably turn up the volume on whatever programming he is watching and drown the rest of us out.  w00t w00t!  As an added bonus, he may also be wearing them, fully aware of our inane dialogue, and only PRETEND not to hear us!  Think of the possibilities!<br /><br />So, for those wanting a convenient set of headphones that have great range (easy 60 feet, through multiple rooms and walls) and reasonable frequency range, these are great.  If you want cinematic sound with great rumbling bass...well...these might not quite cut it for you.  It's perfectly fine if you don't appreciate deep rumbling bass in action flicks or if you simply want to hear news reports and 90% of TV shows.  Just don't think it's going to be the equivalent of a sub-woofer."
R15X9O5BHV5JS6,1,I usually do not take the time to write a review but in this case I had to.  I order my first pair of headphones and when I plug them in I had no power - so I thought what the heck everyone is entitle to a goof so I order another pair - guess what no power.  Don't waste your time or money they are junk.
R3F3FSB906V260,4,"These headphones came out of the box with all accessories necessary for your setup. I have a computer, tv, gaming system in the same area that i wanted to be able to plug in whenever i needed. it has the headphone jack AND the red/white RCA cable connectors.<br /><br />I rated it 4 of 5, because the sound quality isn't amazing. the Bass is lacking, and this is someone expected from crappy rechargeable batteries but i was hoping to be surprised."
R1V4WWE4MG5KO7,5,This item was the best thing I have ever bought my husband. Now I can get to sleep at night without staying up late since I have to get up early to go too work during the week. I have already told a couple of my friends about it.
RN432BOJJTER2,4,These added a great feature to my late night audio needs. I bothered my neighbors with my loud tv.  I no longer have that problem. The sound is so good I use them day or night now.
R2UYCAV3NM7SMW,5,I bought this headset for my husband about two years ago because he likes to stay up late and watch tv and I needed to go to bed.  They work great!  I also use them when the kids are still sleeping and I don't want the tv to wake them.  Loved these so much I recently purchased another for my dad who moved into an apartment complex and has trouble hearing.  He didn't want to bother any of his neighbors and this was a great solution.  He never likes anything new - except for these!
R1O2F6C16QPPK6,5,"Due to external noises I usually had to turn the TV volume quite high, high enough to be heard outside of my living room.  Not good.  So \\""Why is it better for my ears\\""?  Because now external noises are not a problem.  The TV volume control is set at 50%, and the head phones volume is set with the head phone adjustment.  This way there is no bothersome buzz using low source volume and high head phone volume.  Two problems solved here, the first of which is zero sound in the room, and, most importantly, direct controllable input to my ears.    Voila!  The sound that I get with these head phones from the TV or DVD is the sound track from the source, without ANY interference.  I rate this item 5 stars, but only 4 stars from the seller since they are a little slower than most, in my experience."
RHQK4CJNR1I6Y,4,"After much comparing i purchased the sennheiser 120 and i am very satisfied with almost everything about the headphones, my only problem and it is a small one is the headphones are not a tight fit and they will fall off if not careful, after becoming aware of this it is easy to compensate for this minor annoyance, over all I'm glad i purchased this item, the sound is good."
R1ZOQ4AY2XNO88,1,"Setup was easy but everything after that was terrible. I'd tune it in to the TV and would be able to hear the sound just fine except for this weird repeating ticking sound every second or so. I could live with that. I couldn't, however, live with the sudden, very loud bursts of static that would intermittently erupt and jolt me to life, nor the occasion when these bursts are no longer bursts but just one long extremely loud static noise and would wake not only your spouse sleeping next to you, but your neighbors too. What's more, during these bouts of static (which happen without touching the tuning wheel from its current working position), the tuning ability vanishes, and no matter how slowly and carefully you track the wheel to find the signal, it doesn't exist. Until, that is, you unplug the jack from the TV and then reinsert it. Also, for the record, I was never more than 15ft away from the receiver.    I've never returned anything before. Its always too much of a hassle and i'd rather just deal with the issues a product has. This product forced my hand though, because living with it was going to cause either deafness from the static noise or a heart attack from the shock of listening to a perfectly acceptable TV signal erupt into said noise. Terrible disappointment.    The one silver lining to this? I discovered how simple and hassle-free Amazons return service is."
R3ETV6AF1JWTJ7,4,"Headphones are a bit cumbersome and they do not fit tight over the ears.  Sound quality is pretty good, but there is some hissing and static.  This can usually be eased by changing your location a little, although it never goes away completely. Overall, I am happy I purchased this product, but wish I had shopped around a little more and tried others.  The reception distance is very good.  I have no problem hearing the tv from any room in my apartment when wearing the headphones.   As stated before, the biggest drawback for me is the bulkiness of the head set."
R1IBFRLARQNI3H,5,"I wanted to have a set of these for a while, but waited till they went on sale. They sound great, wish I could of afforded the RS180 but these headsets do-not disappoint. worth the money, they have great distance, went from my basement to the top floor of my house with no loss of sound or quility of sound. Also they are great for charging, just put on cradle and you done !! I use them to listen to music on mydesktop computer, easy set up and quick.  ENJOY !!!!"
R385BOANDI3NWH,4,"This is a good inexpensive set of wireless headphones.  Ill break down by category the whole experience.    Hookup - easy. plug in the power for the base station.  Plug in sound cable from the receiver to your tv/computer/whatever.  I use a media server so i plugged it into the front of the computer with the 1/8in jack.    Use.  If you turn it on you can start receiving wireless signals from walkies around your neighborhood.  It was fun for a few minutes by itself to listen in.  But that got boring real fast and I went ahead and dialed in the best reception (you do this right  on the headphones)  And the volume is right next to the tuning which is poor placement but not really much of an issue in practice.    Sound Quality:  Sound quality is good. def good for TV. music i don't know... but i didn't buy it for that purpose.    Dock: is awesome. they charge as soon as you place them on the dock... no plugging in little cords or extra adapters. good design here.    Cons:  There is some static noise in the background when no sound is playing, a slight hiss... but when something is playing you don't even hear it, so i don't really care about the hiss... so far i have never been taken out of a program with it.    Worst Part of Headphones  When there is no sound for a few minutes the base will automatically shut off and you will hear hiss from your headphones. this is annoying, but i just turn off the headphones after im done with them.    Best Part of headphones.  my wife no longer has to yell at me and slam the door to the bedroom (these are in the livingroom with the nice TV) when i watch TV at night and shes trying to sleep.  I might need another set for the bedroom now if I'm ever allowed back. :)    Overall: very satisfied. 4 stars. no 5 since you have to be really outstanding to get 5!"
R253O5YH1VZ7HG,4,Sound quality is very good and wireless reception is also very good. No detectable hiss at all. Tuning was quite easy and charging is as easy as dropping it on the base.    Good enough to be used to listen to audio CDs with full bass and mid-range tones. Sounds as good as my wired Vic Firth headphones. Great value.
R3QCW3H2YR6DH,5,"I read several reviews before deciding to try these headphones. I use them with my TV in the bedroom. I have not had any trouble with static or hissing as some people have reported. I did have to play with the tuning a bit the first time I used them, but once I found the \\""sweet spot\\"" I have not had to touch the tuning. Always clear when I use them. Today I wore them while doing chores about the house, upstairs and downstairs. Still clear so I cannot explain why there is static for some folks and not for others.     For me, the minor downside would be fit. I have a small head and if I am moving around, they are not real secure. But I think if they fit snug I would get a headache, so I am not too concerned about this issue.     I am very happy with the purchase!"
R1HHHPOCVIEKK6,5,"I returned the ear phones because I could not get the background \\""noise\\"" to completely go away.   I have bought a hard wired Bose instead."
R3GAFFMJ2VWGJA,5,"I'm an older retired person and my wife keeps yelling at me about the TV being too loud.  These were a perfect solution!  Had TV Ears before and the IR reception was a giant setback (couldn't even sit back in my recliner without losing reception), But with the Sennheiser 120, I can laydown or go to any room in my house and still get excellent reception.  I use them for TV, CD's, Pandora and have nothing but praise for the quality of sound.  Whats amazing to me is that I can have the volume on the headset turned down low and hear with crystal clarity.  Now I not only hear but understand what people are saying in a movie, even when they are whispering and even young girls when they are talking so fast and quiet.  I now hear movies better than I do people sitting across the table from me.  Truly the answer to all my problems!  I can now sit up all night and watch what I want while my wife sleeps like a baby, and the best part is I don't get yelled at or have to listen to the wife any more! I can turn them up a little bit and drown her out in the daytime or I can turn them lower and still hear if the bad man is trying to break in the house, all the time hearing my shows perfectly.  Range is wonderful, I can sit on the porch, go out in the garage or go to the mail box and hear my music with ease.  I live on a 1/3 acre lot and no where on my property have I lost the signal.  So if your older, get these and preserve your marriage!  **5 Month Update**: After having used these headphones for 5 months, My right channel is coming and going. Playing with the tuner is tedious. I have replaced the batteries and tried switching channels to see if that helps, to no avail.  I use it exclusively for TV. If I put the TV on a music channel and turn the volume up high it tunes in fine and then I switch back to the TV (which is in stereo)it works great for 8 to 10 minutes and then the right channel goes staticky again. The point is it worked perfect for 5 months. I do not think it is some sort of new interference because it does it on all 3 of the headphone channels."
R2DTFGTYAE1QX3,5,"These headphones had been recommended by our family. My husband's hearing is less than perfect, so he has the television volume on at full blast; the sound reverberates throughout the house. Checking various sites, Amazon's price was $35.00 less. They are perfectly suited to our needs. I put them on when viewing programs from England. The voices are clear and concise. We can walk around the house wearing them and still hear the program."
RSVUZ17IWF3B8,2,"Don't nod your head yes or no, because they will fall off.  Don't wear them more than 5 mins without listening to anything, because ONLY the transmitter turns off, your headphone are still on, and you hear nothing but static.  Just bad design over all, and I will not buy another wireless headset from Sennheiser unless they fix these problems."
R3E1CB6XQMTRIV,2,Just received my wireless headphones. Pretty easy to install however..........the background hisssss is pretty annoying. I will probably return and upgrade to a $150 set and hopefully get rid of the Hisssss.    Update: Try turning your TV volume up (maybe 50%) then lowering the headphone volume. This significantly reduced the hisss.  I'm going to change my rating to 3 stars.  Maybe I will keep these headphones.  Not bad for the price.
R16TO012EGNLIH,3,Headphones work ok. But I wear glasses and<br />after using them for awhile they hurt my ears.<br /><br />They could be made alittle more comfortable.
R3PZ5GLA1IOLOB,4,"For stereo headset, this pair is above average for $30 - $100 pair. The sound is clear and bass is adequate. The ear muffs are flat, so it feels like some flat board pressing against my ears with a cloth in between. It's comfortable but definitely doesn't \\""hug\\"" your ear if you know what I mean.    With proper tuning (adjustment to find best reception), it sounds really clear with occasional hissing when I'm viewing TV at 14 feet away. Going away to outside of room, it is still clear around 25 feet even though there are walls separating me and the base unit (charging cradle). This is descent enough for me and I'm happy with it.    I'm also really appreciating with the fact that no need to plug into the headphone for charging.  So far I'm using it for 1.5 hours on the charge.  I have not try to run down the battery to find out how long the two AAA size re-chargeable batteries can really last."
R1CX3SHN2PZQWL,3,I purchased this product for my father who is hard of hearing and turns the TV up loud enough for him to hear but disturbing everyone in the household.  It worked WONDERFULLY at first and then we started having reception issues.  It stopped working and I sent it back to the manufacturer.  The time for repair took too long and I could never reach anyone at the company.  I finally received a replacement pair because they could not fix the original pair.  I will see how these work.
R19GCI9FZWL4NJ,1,"I was very excited to purchase these well reviewed headphones.  Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with them- static was a major problem and the range for tuning in the television station was small.  Sadly, the static and background noise were too loud and rendered dialogue impossible to hear.  We returned them immediately (I will say that Amazon customer service was excellent) as they did not perform as advertised."
R20SIHRFDR5UAQ,5,I bought this item for my husband who is very hard of hearing.  He used it the first day while we watched TV.  It was wonderful to sit there and not have the volume of the TV up so high that it hurt my ears.  He said the quality is great.  The sound is crisp and clear.
RJRBTO30U6FR2,5,I love it. My husband loves it. We can now watch TV without the entire house having to listen to the program. No turning up the volume until it's just to loud for the rest of us. My husband says the head set is very comfortable and clear of any static.
RVA7K624BZ4NH,1,"Save yourself lots of money and don't go for this product.  * There is always a light background noise on the headphones. I have no idea why this isn't going through some noise gate. But it makes me feel like taking off the headphones when there is no music playing.  * When nothing plays for a while, the transmitter turns off, emitting a loud noise from the headphones. Extremely frustrating. This \\""feature\\"" is so stupid. I have to keep turning off the headphones when sound stops from the headphones, which happens a lot. And I have to remember to turn it back on."
RNEV79YWN8X1A,5,I have used these headphones a half-dozen times now and have been quite happy with their performance. There has been very little to no interference in the audio quality coming from from my TV.    I have also walked throughout the house with the headphones on with no loss of signal.    Overall this has been a great product.
R3CTFOGN7CU1W,2,"I was so excited to get these headphones, they were practically perfect on paper. I've been trying to set up my first HTPC setup in my bedroom and thought these would make a perfect contribution. They look appealing, and I really loved the charging station. However, when I opened the box and started digging in, I got more disappointed with each piece I pulled out. First off, the charging station has two audio cables that plug straight into your tv/computer/radio/etc. It comes with an adapter that you can plug the two audio cables into so that you can hook it up to your Ipod or whatever you want to listen to that only has one audio outlet. It's great and all, but not what I was expecting. The second thing that disappointed me was the feel and fit of the headphones. They just feel absolutely cheap. When I put them on it didn't fit like any headphones I'm used to. My boyfriend has a Logitech G930 that feels awesome on your head, these don't. It doesn't fit over your ears right, there's still a gap at the bottom of the headphones and my ears (no matter how I try to adjust them, it just won't fit completely over my ears). Not only that, but while I was playing music through them I could hear everything around me. My family was talking downstairs in the living room and I could still hear them with my music on. It would probably be tolerable if my sole reason for ordering them wasn't so that I could hear my tv without being disturbed. Needless to say, I'm returning these and getting a full refund. Huge disappointment."
R2APM2QBSG3C0Y,3,"I purchased these to replace a similar JVC unit that had finally burned out after 7 years of use.  The box claims a 500 ft range, but It is more like 250 ft.   It adequately covers my 1 acre yard, but it pops and hisses beginning at about 50 ft.   Sound is good, and I have no problem with the charging arrangement.  The headphones fit rather loosely, which can be a problem if doing any yard work.  Overall, not too bad."
R3658D59M4S9ID,4,"Works as advertised. I'll add only that the fit and finish of these headphones was surprisingly good given their price point, but the range in volume is not exactly mind-blowing. Frequently it is either too quiet or too loud; it is difficult to get it just right.     That said, if you want to watch TV without bothering others in the house, this is the way to do it."
R2W53A9AI2GOAH,1,"Returning to Amazon.    They worked just fine in that once the tuning dial is adjusted correctly, you do get good sound. The only problem is the ear pieces are not designed such that they seal around your ears (look at the pictures). They are a flat surface. The headphones do not grip very tightly. They do have some mass (mass = quality?). Combine poor grip, flat surfaces and mass and one can understand why these headphones are susceptible to falling off. Don't make any sudden movements or bend over to pick something up or they will fall off. I bought these to wear while working outside around the house (and to drown out the neighbors barking dogs and their never-ending outdoor music). If you only intend to wear them while you watch TV or play video games then they will probably be okay, but don't expect them to stay on your head if you are actively moving around.    Also, the tuning dial (what's with that anyway?) is right next to the volume control. The tuning dial must be adjusted to get the best reception. Not a big deal but, the location of the tuning dial is right next to the volume dial. And there-in lies another problem, when attempting to adjust the volume, you will inadvertently adjust the tuning dial. It will happen, they are right next to each other. Incredibly poor design.    These are going back to Amazon. It's hard to believe all the good reviews. I guess most people use these while sitting still and don't need to adjust volume very often if any.    Positives:  Decent range  Comfortable (but to a fault, see below)    Negatives:  Ear pieces are flat and do not seal around your ears.  Headphones put very little pressure on your head so they fall off easily.  The tuning dial is next to the volume dial, it is too easy to adjust the wrong dial."
R3EAQST1KOVUI8,4,I love the quality of the sound with this wireless headset. The only negative is that the headset sits a little to loose on my head and there is no way to adjust the width of.
RB5AZWLHXFH9O,4,"The very comfortable Radio Shack unit I used has been discontinued.  Unfortunately, that unit had to be replaced often and is no longer available.  The Sennheiser seems more reliable, has good sound and excellent range -- even several rooms away from the transmitter.  I just wish it was smaller and a bit more comfortable for use when lying in bed to watch television   I'm glad that I purchased the unit with rechargeable batteries as it is nice not to have to replace batteries and likely is more economical in the long run."
RVNQ00X3PF6BP,4,Bought this for my hard of hearing 94yr old mother.  We discovered that our big screen Sony LED3 TV does not have a plug-in space for the headphones so we can not use them on the primary TV.  We would suggest that you check this option on your TV before purchase.  The headphones are awesome for listening and sound quality is excellent!
R4VEN6WXA4EM0,4,"This thing is really great except that it does not fit my head.  Because of that, it falls off a lot and drops onto the floor so now it is starting to have problems playing!  The earpieces are flat in addition to the width between them being rather large.    If it were only to fit better I wold be totally satisfied.  This is so much bigger on my head than other headphones I have a hard time believing I am the only one with this problem.  On the other hand, I do ride a motorcycle and my helmet is an extra small Arai, so you be the judge.  I am going to have to buy new headphones because these are clearly going to stop playing soon, even though I just bought them about a month and a half ago.    If these fit you you will love them.  I wish they would make them for smaller people!"
R32Q25V8ZU0IWG,4,"The sound is very good.  I have no hissing or background noise.  The sound is just as good as I move throughout the house, so I can stay tuned to the movie.  I had to hook it up to the BluRay because there are no easy connections to the Panasonic HDTV for it. That is a greater fault of the TV than the earphones.  When the earphones are put in the cradle for recharging, you have to check to be sure that the red light goes on.  It is easy for the earphones to set askew in the cradle, since the padded ears can rub against the sides of the charger and keep one side or other from connecting to the metal cradle to recharge the batteries."
R3TBCS8HSDL3BC,5,"I've recently purchased the headphones and I must say, they blew me away. Even though I had some fears of problems I had read about here, I gave it a shot anyway. I'm far from the true audiophile who should be rating this product, but I really enjoy sound quality and my reference is watching HD movies/shows through a DENON AVR-164 receiver and JBL satelite speakers (which I honestly think could be better, but sound really good to me). So you could say I'm not so easy to satisfy either...<br />Getting back to the headphones, they sound just great. I had a little trouble setting the apropriate frequency at first (cause I was only changing the knob on the headphones), so I kept losing the signal and thought I'd have problems with it. Was I mistaken... as soon as I changed the switch at the base, finding the frequency was a piece of cake, and it will not lose it anymore. Again, I use it for watching TV so distance is quite short (around 7-8ft). Batteries are also great so far, one full charge and I've watched 3 movies with no recharge...<br />Anyway, I've already tested the Monster Beats headphones and they're plainly impressive. However, if your objective and requirements are similar to mine, you will probably not be disappointed: great sound quality, great reception, very comfortable and even stylish. All this at an affordable price. Definitely recommended."
R1BBAQPINK3VDO,4,I am a woman and the headphones are just too big for me. -slipping every time my head moves. Solved by piece o9f elastic from earphone to earphone around back of head. C ontrols fiddly. Rest good
R3FDFLC9IWG5TX,5,"I have been watching TV with wireless headsets for over ten years.  These are the most natural best sounding wireless headsets I have ever owned.  The stereo seperation and base response are fantastic.  Finally, headsets that are not too tight."
R2SVI5IGT45DUJ,1,I had to return the headphones same day I received because: (1) the green light would not light up power up; (2) the headphones would not seat snugly but rock on the transmitter-charger so could not establish contact with the base unless pushed down and hold while charging! Poor workmanship or inspection.  I wouldn't buy Sennheiser products again.    Piyush
R3BSF6O64G6OYB,5,Bought these for my 73 yr old father. They work great. He has had very little problems using the headphones. The only problem he kept changing the tuning dail instead of the volume. He has problems with his hands and can not easily move his fingers. I taped the tuning dail in place. Problem solved. Description of product was accurate. Delivery was completed before the due date. Setup easy and ready to use in less than 5 minutes. All required cords and adapters were included. Reconmend rechargable headphones for elderly users due to difficultly with removing/installing batteries.
R8PJB4W7PS73Z,4,"These headphones work perfectly with my surround system, it's just a standard headphone jack plug in and that's it.  The sound quality is about what I expected from a cordless headset. Not great, but not terrible.  I bought these so I can watch movies and play games, etc. while my family is sleeping.    My only complaint is that the tuning and volume controls on the headset are analog dials. Sometimes it's hard to get the tuning just right to eliminate the static, depending on where I'm sitting."
R1QAJDQIEOUSRE,5,"Don't pay any attention to the negatives on some reviews, they are just hypercriticals sounding off.  This set has great sound and great bass. The tune button helps to get it set just right on the frequency from the tv.  I can set my bedroom tv volume to zero (that's where I have it plugged in), turn on the music channel with some good old oldies music (with a good beat) and go in the exercise room and do my routine to some good stuff and the tv is not bothering my wife. My head just bobs to the music and nobody but me is hearing a thing. I love these headphones. I checked independent reviews and \\""best\\"" recommended headphones and this was rated the best for the money. Recommend them to anyone.  Make sure you have them plugged in the right spot on back of tv and that the plug is pushed in all the way, otherwise you will wonder why they are not working or not working good.  I know. Tv is Samsung 32\\"" LCD flat screen and 2 plugins on the back, get it right and you will enjoy some great sound."
R3DSJIRY3N0IKC,4,"I bought these headphones because they were advertised as great for TV.  Which they are... but not if you have a newer TV that only has digital output.  To get these to work, you also have to buy a digital-to-analog converter and a fiber optic cable to hook it to the TV, which increases the total cost by about 50% compared to the headphones alone.    Once I had all the pieces, they work pretty well, although the channel selection to avoid interference isn't great.... I experience a fair amount of clicks and other noises."
R39WA0C1DPP2ZG,5,"Great sound, comfortable, and I can fix dinner AND hear the news from the other room.  YEAH!  =)"
RN8GAJMQHM4JC,4,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones mostly for the convinience of listening to music without the hassle of carrying around my ipod. The headphones itself is okay, everything works as advertised, the only problem that I have with the headphones itself is the volume control on the headphones. I always have a problem finding it while wearing the headphones. Once in awhile the headphones will lose reception, but I just tune the reception dial on the headphones (if I can find that also while wearing it). I did some online research on the internet before I bought these, and for the price that Amazon.com had it for, I really can't complain, especially for getting a name brand product like Sennheiser."
RBS09IYIZ4QZZ,3,"The headphones are adequate. If you need mobility and reasonably good sound these are a good value for the effort.  They do not reproduce high quality sound by any stretch of the imagination.  The real drawback is the distortion that occurs at higher level volume and the speakers in headphones are not sufficient to create good bass.  Great for listening to movies.  Poor if you want hifidelity for music.  A good frame of reference would be comparing them to good (not great) conventional wired headphones.  These wireless headphones would rate about a \\""6\\"" in comparison."
RZCY7RF2EWHAU,3,"Just got these yesterday. Read instructions, put batteries in and let it charge for the full 24hrs before I used it.    The good on power:    I have had no issues with charging so if any review complaining of that is experiencing this later in the product ownership there is nothing actually preventing you from charging it. Yes if you move it a little off etc it stops charging but if you just sit it on and leave it there with the charging confirmation LED you are fine. It works as intended and is very convenient. Also a plus is the ac adapter which apparently is designed to consume less power than needed.    The bad on power: It said in the instructions you must charge the batteries for 18hrs subsequently after use. I have no idea why they say this or if it's even true but this was misleading to me. I only throw it on the charger when i'm done with it and use it when I need to. As for battery length I have been using it for almost 8hrs straight so far with no problems I will update how long it takes until it dies out following the 24hr initial charge cycle. It sucks that there is no option to charge a separate set of batteries while you are using the headset off the charger because once they die, what then? It's a wise investment to get the best/right battery upgrade with independent charger. Make sure you never use anything except rechargeable tripe a's as per the instructions.    The good on comfort/design: This set seems sturdy and has a very acceptable build quality. They are more aesthetically pleasing than the other models in my opinion. They are also very comfortable which is great for extended use.    The bad on comfort/design: The trade off for comfort is that these do not clam onto your head at All. They are built \\""wide\\"" and are just really bad at staying fit. Any jarring or thrusts in any direction, especially if you have a head of hair will uncomfortably shift them forward and back off your head. This was very inconvenient and also prevents using the wireless benefits in a lot of situations such as on a tread mill where you would need it to hang on. This was a loss in star alone. I understand it's a trade off but I would have settled for a more snug fit and sweaty ears then such a loose fit. Some may have a fatter head to put it bluntly and not experience this as much or come to appreciate the design in that case but I have a nice size normal head and it was just not good enough. Others have commented on this.    More: The biggest fail on the design that equaled another star for me is how amazingly loud the open ear design is. It was the very first thing I noticed. If you blast these or literally have them on any sound level they are COMPLETELY audible to anyone in around you or in passing distance! This is terrible to me. Even the cheapest pair of headphones can contain the sound to a personal distance. I do not see the purpose either. It's not like you can hear anyone with them on a fair volume level anyway, so why not make them like enclosed cans? This is just unacceptable to me.    The good on reception: I have went a pretty far about 150ft on the 1st floor with the transmitter on the 2nd and have had great clarity with these. I enjoyed that a lot. I always get it in the middle of the \\""beginning and end\\"" of the loud part of the tuning knob and that works best.    The bad on reception: This was another star off. The reception can be very finicky. What I seem to experience is the further I am away from the transmitter the Better it is! I cannot explain this. There is absolutely no interference as I turned off everything except the WiFi (which could be the issue) and you would think being closer would be better but I guess it's like a WiFi network where too close is bad. I am within 5-8ft of it and cannot make it farther because the cabling provided will not allow for that. I am just really disappointed with the clarity. I mean the slightest shift in movement or turning your head is accompanied by distortion and crackling or static. Mainly static. I have tried every one of the 3 channels to no avail. I find myself having to find a spot and staying fairly still.     The reviewers claiming a hissing are absolutely correct. I have the audio sources on max and the headphones on medium and when a track comes to an end there is a definite hissing sound as you would hear in your car while on max but much more audible. It's not quite obnoxious but definitely noticeable. I find it unappealing and being someone who has always wanted to try Sennheiser products this certainly was a sad experience in that regard.    I will be returning these and chalk it up to wireless headsets being an unrefined technology. I will be testing the more expensive ones before I rest my case, specifically the 130s and the 180s. I am hoping I will have a better experience with the 130s. These 120s seem more or less just entry level. I wouldn't even touch anything less than this model. I really wanted these to work because I had every intention of keeping them before I tried them. I cannot say enough about the freedom from wires. I am so tired of tripping and yanking the laptop about while catching myself. It doesn't happen that often but that benefit plus not having wires all over me is very liberating and I believe most reviews are based on this luxury and not the clarity/quality which must come first. I'd much rather have a wired set that was clear and loud than one that ever ever crackled or hissed or had static more than once per 30seconds to a minute depending on how much I move.    *I must admit I experienced a ton of clipping when blasting music and more than lacking bass and sound quality but this is 95% unlikely to be the fault of the headphones since I was using it with a Vostro 1510 with on board sound; i.e. my system didn't have the necessary power to drive the hardware. I would really enjoy a wireless usb headset from Sennheiser since it would by pass the on board chip. I don't know if that's an available option or not.    Final words: I remember reading about auto-tuning adjustment or something regarding volume on these I believe. I have noticed how songs shift in volume during the beginning or end of a song on occasion. It is irritating to have it essentially override my volume setting and it's not very intelligent. If someone can shed more light on this that would be nice. It doesn't happen too often but I don't like it and would like to turn it off somehow.    *UPDATE: I have since tried the headset while watching an online TV show and am happy to report a great majority of the distortion and reception issues weren't present. This indicates that my on board sound processor is in fact the cause of much of the crappy sound. It just doesn't have the power to push music files hard enough to drive what these headphones can handle. I am assuming media files require much more power especially for .FLAC compared to a simple video audio stream. I am going to test it with a movie tonight and report on that but I experienced only 1-5% of the static issues when moving around while watching and I had to purposely try to. Before I had experienced 50-70% occurrence of static when moving even a little. Moving the transmitter off the floor and onto a table also helped a lot. Mounting it to the wall is convenient and recommended, it has the recessed hook built in just no hardware.    P.S. I have raised the rating to 3 stars to reflect this development."
R2RSFUG73YPV0U,5,"Not only is this fine device great for the hearing impaired, it also serves well for the spouse that hears well to listen to a TV show while another in the room wants to read without TV sound interference.  We have a high quality stereo TV but this product brings out sounds that normally can't be heard through the TV speakers.  I also tried the \\""TV Ears\\"" but this product is much better.  I do wish the ear pieces were a bit more comfortable as they are flat (not cupped) and need to be moved a bit after a nominal period of use.  They are a great buy as is but I would be willing to pay a bit more for more comfortable ear pieces.  As usual, Amazon's delivery is better than their estimate!"
R2LEQIYMH9O8ZW,5,"I bought these because the air conditioner in my bed room is about 5 feet from my TV and no matter how loud I would make the TV volume it would just sound terrible, so I felt as though wireless head phones would be the best way to solve the problem. In short, these worked perfectly. If you need wireless head phones for whatever reason I think these are pretty great.    Pros  - Sound is great. I'm used to wearing ear bud headphones so I wasn't sure how these would sound but they do a great job. They definitely keep outside noise out and after a while I almost forget that I'm wearing head phones.  - The rechargeable batteries and conductive charging is a great feature. I pretty much wont buy anything that uses disposable batteries any more and the conductive charging on the base station is just an incredibly practical and useful feature. Apparently they have incredible battery life, but as easy as it is to charge them I can't see it ever being an issue anyway. It seriously makes me hate everything else I own that I still need to plug in to charge.    Cons (None of these are really product flaws or anything, but just based on personal preference and usability that should be considered)  - As I mentioned, I normally wear ear buds so the form factor took a bit of getting used to. They are pretty comfortable, but I don't think they fit as snug as I would like. Its more a personal thing though but it might be worth trying them on in store before hand if possible.    Other than that I really can't think of anything to worry about if you're looking for wireless headphones. I'm almost never more than 10 or so feet from the receiver so I can't really comment or the range or reception."
R1B3UH03MG96N1,5,You don't know until you try it! Trust me can't get any better than this.  I have nothing else to say but it's good stuff.
R3G77DGROPTS6G,5,"I am so thankful that Amazon keeps records of prior purchases AND that purchased items have a notation at the top of the page, \\""You purchased this item on [date]\\""!    We first purchased these for my mother ages ago so that she wouldn't bother neighbors in her condo 'up North' for the summer.  They were so wonderful that she requested a second set for her Florida winter home.  Of course, it's always a kick when I stop by to visit and she comes out of the den looking like an alien in her headset, but she loves the fact that she can get up to get herself lunch or a snack and not have to 'miss any action' on whatever she's watching.    Of course, Florida is a big 'visitors' place, so she gets lots of company when she's there who then see her set-up.  I personally have purchased several more sets on behalf of friends and relatives who had visited and fallen in love with these headphones, and have forwarded this web page to at least a half dozen more of her visitors who have then purchased them themselves. They are marvelous and have worked flawlessly for all so far.  I can't recommend them highly enough.    One further comment:  One set I purchased was for my former mother-in-law who has had severe hearing impairments since she was in her 30s.  These headphones have been a godsend for her, as well as for her downstairs neighbors."
RJ69FCBMS0FI0,4,"Own 2 sets of these earphones. I've only owned a short while, so I can't attest to longevity, but they are a big improvemnt over tv speakers. I am very satisfied."
R38FFS1SNLU6IK,5,"I purchased these to hook up directly to my Panasonic VT25 series plasma. Please be aware that most newer TV's, unlike sound system receivers, do not have the correct connections (Headphone jack or analog output). I purchased a Toslink digital to analog converter and the headphones work Great! They sound great, easy volume controls, overall excellent! So, if you want to connect directly to a TV, double check your TV's sound output ports or may need to purchase a digital to analog converter."
R31WPSUKTQMRQG,4,"It does what it is supposed to do. Gives good quality (not audiophile quality) wireless sound from HD TV and ITouch over 50 feet or so, with comfortable ear pads. It charges easily and works just fine. I'm very pleased with the product after a month or so of use. On my new Sony TV I have it plugged into the headphone out jack  on the rear of the TV . On the TV menu there is a selection which allows the built in TV speakers to continue to operate even tho the headphones are plugged into the \\""headphone\\"" jack. So, if my wife is watching TV at a lower volume than I can clearly hear, I can use the headphones and adjust the headset volume where I need it. If she goes to bed, I can reduce the TV volume to min, but the volume stays the same in my headset.  I am also trying to improve my Spanish. By using the headphones when watching \\""novelas\\"" in Spanish, the dialogue is easier for me to discern, than with the TV speakers. While the TV speakers are quite good, I still prefer the headphones for clarity of dialogue.     Headset stays in place if I'm not too active, but fall off if I start moving around or bending over."
R3UM0P6W08PQZ1,5,"Very happy with the product.  Works as advertised and vastly better than my old cheapos that gave up the ghost.  Although I had standard delivery, it arrived overnight which far exceeded my expectations.  I would prefer a snugger fit at the ears, but everything else is fine."
R1KPUZ9Y5WCO1I,5,"The RS120 Headphone is just great[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    RECOMMEND     Stay with RF, not the IF advertised on TV."
R1ZPV0IQG41G0C,5,You can walk around my entire house with these on and not lose signal or quality.  These are great for nighttime when you spouse is trying to sleep and you want to watch TV.
RTK718LP6359W,3,"I have to work 8 hours a day listening people for quality service. For this reason, for me it is not comfortable. Most of the time when I perfect sincronize it, it makes interference sounds that hits my ears."
R2ERHZTIS45PPV,2,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 with charging cradle. I found that I could not use it on my Toshiba 32 inch LCD because I needed an audio adapter for it. It seems that most newer tv sets have an optical audio output connection and the Sennheiser headphone is not equipped to attach to this type  output. When I attempted to attach the headphones to my tv set I found that there was no headphone type audio output connection on the set. Through research I discovered that I must purchase a digital to analog adapter along with cables for about $30 so that I can use it. It is not just the extra money I must pay out but it is the inconvenience of having to go through the extra work to do the research and to purchase the adapter that may or may not work. As I understand it most new tvs have the same type of audio output as mine does so I know I am not the only person who has experienced this issue. Sennheiser sells many different headphones and other audio equipment, they should be able to keep up with new technology. As for the headphone I purchased I am not sure whether I am going to return the headphones or get the adapter. So my review is not for the my listening experience but for the lack of technology to permit me to listen to it."
R2ER4C9YJ9WBQ9,5,"My boyfriend loves to watch crime shows all day on his day off.  I HATE the sound of gunfire in the house in the middle of the afternoon and prefer to listen to music.  We ordered these headphones and are thrilled with them.  The range and clarity are fantastic and he can listen to his shows and relax all day without me having to hear anything.  I thought that they would be specifically for his listening, but figured out yesterday that instead of having my IPOD outside while I was doing yardwork, I could turn on my APPLE TV ipod and listen to music with these healphones in the backyard.  I can tune in to the music stations and the clarity is fantastic.  The neighbors will beneift from the use of these healphones in the yards as they will not have to hear the music either.  BEST PURCHASE I have made in recent years. I have been telling all my friends to buy these and they are all thrilled with them.  As for those poor reviews, I suggest returning them for a replacement pair because they must be defective."
RDVF2P30WWU0M,1,I order and then had to send back and reorder a 2nd which i am sening back after 3 days different problem each time it seems like it is just like most stuff made in china u r lucky if it works for a week I really would like to find one that is good quality but I assure u this is not
R2IX2T75WBDFXH,5,"I ordered this product for my hearing-impaired brother and his wife. (She is not hearing-impaired but probably would have been if she'd had to continue watching TV at the volume my brother required!) The description did not make clear to me whether the headset volume could be increased without a corresponding increase in external TV audio, but IT CAN! It is such an improvement in their listening experience - the frustration and irritation of volume wars are now a thing of the past. The headphones are lightweight and comfortable, and being wireless allows for normal activities, like ducking out to the kitchen or bathroom without missing dialogue. Thanks to Sennheiser for a great product!    One last thing: take the manufacturer's word for it: everything IS in the box!"
R2T3JDA5NFG2UE,1,"Unless I got a defective product, I just don't understand the good reviews for this.  The reception is bad.  I constantly had to adjust the sound and there was frequently some extra buzzing or something.  Worst of all, sometimes it would just lose connection with the base and I'd have to go to the base and fiddle with it.    I was not using this outside the bounds of normal use either.  I wasn't moving around.  I was less than 10 feet away.  I just wanted to watch TV late at night in my bed.  I had better wireless headphones 7 YEARS AGO!  Too bad I can't find them."
R1KB2R3PBW15GB,4,"They work damn well. I like that they tune in, since we have 2 of these set up in the house. I can either tune to my tv or the other as i like.    only real problem i have is when wearing them, if i look down they fall off my head. so i hold them if i'm going to be looking down for some reason."
R11FJCYK51GNN1,4,"First off, I'll say that these are the first pair of headphones of this type that I've bought; and I love them!  I don't mean to reference other reviews, but some of the problems that are being reported just aren't happening for me, and that make me even more glad for my purchase; so I'll go over everything that I can.  Here's my pros:  The delivery: was prompt and fast - nothing bad about that.  The setup: Quick and easy - you simply need to put the included batteries in and plug in a few wires and boom, you're ready.  The product features: I love the dual purpose stand/charging unit - there's a metal perch that fits into small grooves on the headpiece of the headphones - it makes the set a bit more compact and cut down on superfluous wiring, which also makes me happy.  The headphones basically come ready to use (Despite the instruction's advice to charge the batteries for a day before use.) and the fit and feel of the headphones are pretty natural - they rest fairly snugly on your head and ears and the adjustments on the device are pretty solid - unlike other headsets that have pretty flimsy adjustments (Like my friend's skullcandys)  The sound quality on these is fairly good - there is no real loud interference - that is, unless you move too far away - but the overall quality is amazing.  The knob placement on these headphones is really no big deal - I mean, I've had these for a few days and I can basically feel for the volume knob without throwing the tuning out of whack - there's really no need to complain there.    And here are my Cons:  While the headphones fit somewhat snug, the adjustment and fitting to your head are somewhat weird and even when they feel snug on your head, bending over can result in the headphones slipping forward off your head - I've already dropped mine off of my head; and I suspect they will fall more and more over time.  The limited amount of interference can sometimes be annoying - luckily, there's no real sign of interference while music is playing, and any interference can be easily erased with some fine tuning of the \\""tune\\"" knob.  The \\""Auto shutoff\\"" feature of this device is also pretty annoying - luckily I'm pretty used to sudden loud sounds, but to those of you potential buyers who aren't; be like me and avoid the surprises by shutting your headset off when you're not using it; I've gotten in a habit of turning it off after a minute or so of listening to static.  And a big one: The distance you can fully be away from the transmitter is HIGHLY EXAGGERATED! The box says you can listen to music up to 330 feet away - and maybe it's my house's layout or something, but I can barely walk from my room (Where the transmitter is) to the family room (about 30 feet in walking distance around a corner) without getting highly noticeable pops and cutting out during my music. And the transmitter does not do very well with televisions; as there is not much background music that blocks out the audible static.     Overall, I think these headphones are pretty awesome, they have flaws, but so will most other wireless headsets you buy - I'd say that these are great for how much enjoyment I've gotten out of them; You could probably go search for a potentially better set, but I'd say these are well worth their price.  I give them an A-"
R3EQ0IFAP69VIK,3,"with some newer tv sets, you will need a digital to analog audio converter in order to attach the transmitter analog rca cables . right now i have the transmitter  connected to the back of the cable box at the variable output rca jacks ..    the ear phones are no where near as comfortable as the rs 80 series they are replacing. if the battery charging was not a problem with rs 80. the rs 80 would never have been replaced.  range and sound clarity are excellent and extend way beyond the tv picture .  the ear pad simply lacks the comfort you would expect from sennheiser .  not sure if ear pads are interchangeable with other models to achieve increased comfort .headphones are easy to rest on charger and begin charging -flawlessly    too soon to tell about battery charger and battery life ."
RN8UGT59YHYGL,5,"We use the \\""Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle* with our TV and we're now able to hear every word spoken and music sounds amazing. We also purchased the additional Sennheiser RS120 headphone and in every way this was a five star purchase!"
R2CKZHKUSW71K6,5,"I'd like to thank the Real King of France (TROKF) for reminding us that Miami is in Florida, which is in the USA. Also for the suggestion that next time he suggests some misbegotten foreign flick, which certainly wasn't filmed in Miami, part of Florida, in the USA, I can put the Sennheiser on my dog, and let him go play in heavy traffic. To quote the King: \\""I will,  five out of seven nights, fall asleep wearing them.\\"" No kidding Rodg, next time, watch an American movie.    OSU!!! OUS!!! OSU!!!"
R3II45P0ODPQ41,4,"Years of rock bands and machine gunning leave me damned near deaf. For the past 3-4 years I turned to TV Ears (3 different sets at $100+) so I can understand what's being said in British movies. TV Ears are among the most poorly engineered products I've encountered. They are overpriced, uber uncomfortable  with ear pads that keep falling off,  and not easily replaced;  have a battery life between recharges measured in hours, and are line-of-sight so don't go to the bathroom during a movie.<br /><br />When the last pair's expensive to replace proprietary battery died, I went shopping for something else. Someone suggested Sennheiser. There are a zillion models; I went with medium cheap (about $79). It's only been a month, and so far I love them. The stereo sound is crisp. I can run after the dog outside and never lose the signal. They're comfortable; and the batteries are great. I will,  five out of seven nights, fall asleep wearing them.  When I wake up they're still working, and I'm still using the same AA rechargeable batteries that came with it.  I've dropped them on the (wood) floor a few times; nothing broke. What else it there?  I endorse them for President."
RHGI5NZLRIDY,5,met expectations
R2IBYQ2UW0DEJ2,5,I bought these for my husband who is hard of hearing. Of course the tv was turned up VERY loud whether we were sitting and watching or when I was trying to go to sleep. This was the BEST investment I have made in years!!! Now I can hear the television without losing an eardrum and I can get to sleep at night with no problem. Every man or woman who lives with someone who is hard of hearing and too proud to get a hearing aid should invest in a set of these. My husband loves them too. The words are clearer and not all jumbled up like he normally hears things. A great investment in your sanity!!!!
R2JG784WUNC1DS,4,I like the headphones.  I replaced the on ear cushions with around ear cushions. they are much more comfortable for me.
RT406UPZ8HE43,5,"This is my first wireless head set. It is great, I love walking around with it. I can sit on the patio and watch the \\""Braves\\"" on the big screen through the window. The range is better than advertised, I just for fun got in the car and drove to see the range, I got approx. 2 blocks before the sound distorted. Great product...."
RMEHUPUE40SQV,5,"When watching our favorite TV series/programs, my husband likes the volume in the 20-24 range while I prefer the 10-12 range - plus we have 2 parakeets who increase their volume (it's a flock thing...), to match the TV's!!!  Since receiving/setting up these headphones, my husband wears them and smiles like a Cheshire cat while I watch TV at my volume level or hit the \\""mute\\"" button and read and the birds quietly sleep - we're all happy!!!  I must confess that I sometimes miss a bit of dialog and have 'borrowed' the headphones when they've just been sitting and charging.  Truth to tell, these headphones are awesome and today I ordered a pair for myself after checking to make sure that 2 pr. could use the same charger and TV connection.  Other reviewers have praised this arrangement so we're going to give it a try.  We haven't had any \\""hissing\\"" that others have mentioned but I did notice that turning the headphones into upside-down/sideways positions produced a static-like noise - we chalked that up to Lesson #1 in the \\""Don't Do\\"" column..."
R1W6OSH5OANQ9Q,4,"A great product, but the headphones are too large for someone without a large head.  The headphones fall off if you lean forward to pick something up."
R3HEDFCE11WASC,5,"I have been using these headphones for about three years. I wear them around the house so that I can listen to things while I do housework, etc. I've worn them to the basement and out on the front porch--the PC is in the back of the house on the second floor. I've experimented with changing the frequency on the tuner to get the best response so as not to conflict with other devices in the area--some of our phones are on similar frequencies, and I get less static from the headphones if I alter the frequency. There is a light hiss while I'm wearing them, but that is standard for any pair of wireless headphones and I am used to it now.It is not generally disruptive and I can distinguish it from other hiss (e.g. hiss in audio that I am editing). If I want to do extremely serious audio editing, I check it on a pair of wired headphones or monitors.    I have a small head, and a lot of headphones do not get small enough for me. These stay on my head. The only problem is that if I shake my head or move around too quickly they fall off. They give me good sound without cancelling. Sometimes I want noise cancellation; but sometimes I need to be able to monitor the environment as well as enjoy my soung. I appreciate not having to sacrifice sound quality for this."
RG3DN1QYI95B0,5,"For 8 months, I used the headphones by plugging into the TV headphones plug--not a good idea.  The sound quality wasn't very good.  I had to hold my head a certain way, and I lie on the couch.  It didn't work very well.  I still recommended them to my friends, who bought them.  THEY plugged them into their TV audio out.  SMARTER.  I do that now, and they are EXCELLENT!  I can move my head around, and the quality is vastly improved!  I HIGHLY recommend them, now!  My partner is MUCH happier, because I am willing to wear them!"
RGQM77L9FKBCX,2,I was impressed by the customer service but the product was not so good.  The reception was terrible and the did not service its purpose for design.  The charging cradle is misleading because it doesn't really charge.  The headset requires batteries and the cradle only holds the headset.
R6SI5WNRKRA8T,5,"This product has brought tranquility to my home!  My husband can listen to the TV as much as he wants with this device, and I get to listen to quiet.  It is VERY EASY to install...a key reason I purchased it."
R3PYQKQ3HM6U2H,4,"I am happy with my purchase of the Sennheiser (RS120 926 MHz) wireless headphones.  My previous wireless TV hearing device was a set of \\""TV Ears.\\""  In comparison, I probably should give the Sennheiser product all 5 stars.  The battery life of the RS120 puts the TV Ears to shame, that is the most significant difference in the products.      My need for the device is due to hereditary nerve deafness which has progressed noticeably in recent years (I am 63 years old).  Please remember that you must use all similar headphone & earbud products with caution.  It is very easy to increase volume beyond the safe range, especially for people with conditions similar to mine.    PS: Service from Amazon was excellent, as have been all our former Amazon purchases."
R3L9G4CP2ISUQG,1,"<<The following review is in my son's own words. He has had a very disappointing experience with these headphones, and Sennheiser's customer service was unwilling to help him (they told him to send the headphones back for evaluation, but that any repair charges would be to him). I would hate to think that they were unresponsive because he is not an adult?>>  After my experience with these headphones, I will never buy another sennheiser product again. I hear static and tics through the headphones. I have called and called, even memorized the phone number, I'v called so many times. If you think, ok, so only one bad review, this bad review counts for a million bad reviews. I wish I could rate sennheiser at negative 5 stars."
RGF4788NNNIAK,5,"I'm a 70 year young retiree, lost some of my finer hearing over the years and some of these tv shows and movies leave a lot to be desired in their audio department!!<br />Some shows I hear just fine..others are where I need the headphones!  I'll be honest, the headphones are so comfortable, I find I wear them most of the time!!<br />Bad Thing is..If I have them on and the wife speaks to me..Oh well, you get the picture!  My Brother has the model Rs130 which has been discontinued..Although at least 1 outfit has jacked the price to $199..NOT!! Save your money and buy the RS120..Anyway, I wore my brothers most of the week-end and I don't see or Hear the difference between the RS130 and the RS120..<br />I can walk all over the house, upstairs-downstairs, out in the yard and NEVER lose<br />The signal!  Thank you Sennheiser for the wonderful product!<br /><br />UPDATE 2-9-12<br />I was using this phone with a 12 year old MIT...Just purchased the MIT WD73640 3d unit and these phones will NOT work with this unit!  The \\""fix\\"" according to Sennheiser is to buy the Digital to Anolog Converter that they sell for $49 plus shipping..Have NOT made that purchase..not sure if I will!<br />Update 2-24-13<br />ALL i needed was an AB switch box to use my head phones..When I watch anything through the tivo box or live tv..I use the A switch..When I watch through the blu ray player, I use the B switch!  Cost me $4.00"
RM8A4ZGWF7BEE,5,"This is the second set of these headphones in our household.  They are a superb brand, and produce excellent, clear sound."
R1I4JMVR8XVN24,5,That's all I can say for now.  I have had these on for 5 minutes and they're amazing.  I walked all through my house (3000 sf) and out in the backyard about 200 yards to our shed and lost ZERO sound quality.  I'm wearing them now as I type at my desktop with no interference.  These things are most fantastic.
R2PR350A4IIZKU,5,"These headphones have a wide range and when you move around, the sound stays the same.  I had another pair and when I turned my head, there would be a lot of static, which does not happen with the Sennheiser headphones.  I would recommend these to anyone who wishes a quality pair of wireless headphones."
R389B6GP1B9HRB,5,Product was recommended by my brother and he had tried several other brands. I use it every night and it has improved our quality of life.
RGNJOPD5EQ8TS,5,"I purchased these headphones for use when watching movies late at night to keep from disturbing others in the house. I have been more than satisfied because this product exceeded my expectations. It was very easy to set up and to use. The sound is crisp with dialogue easy to follow and enough bass in the soundtrack to satisfy without overpowering. Definitely one of the best purchases I have ever made. Highly recommend this headset to anyone. As far as charging and cradling the headset, I have never had any issues. Just watch for the red light to come on and you will know that the headset is mounted properly to charge. I have had these now for close to a year and enjoy them regularly."
R2JOOWTCSG1YRT,3,"Why does this product have an analog tuning wheel? Digital PLL tuning has been around for decades now, and the base unit only has three frequencies.  It would have been so much better to just have a three position switch on the headphones as well.  And whose idea was it to have that tuning wheel right next to the volume control? I guess I'll eventually remember which is which, unless I return the unit and try again."
RVIL2TSM17BDS,5,These things are nice great for video games movies and tv not so much music but still sounds good and people have been saying there is static no way I don't hear it at all those must be just bad head phones or your stereo sucks but any ways buy them don't piss around just do it
R2QW6DKLC3JHWG,1,"These Headphones REALLY got me pumped for Father's Day when I received them, I noticed the stand seemed to be missing. I have so far spent three days hooked these up to two computers, my Tv and get static and some sort of digital signal that chirps in and out. I had a pair of no name thirty dollar headphones that blew these away. Keep shopping, I'm putting these in the return box.I have heard no actual recognizable audio from these."
R3KRNN6XHSWQAM,5,"This is a great set of headphones. It's leaps and bounds ahead of the wireless headphones I've tried in the past. The charging station is great (the metal stand charges the headphones), the sound quality is excellent, and no interference even though the base sits directly behind my TV.    My baby can sleep while I shoot people on my PS3. What more can I ask for?"
R3T0EURXT2GMU5,5,"I see many people complained about the tuning signal. Maybe it is the individual usages and different types of walls and area, but I put these through the real test. My findings is once I found the signal it locked in no matter if I went around my house or down the street. I get at least 100 feet outside my stereo and no drop of signal or loss of sound. I keep the charges/antenna up on top of the cabinet and some FM channels may need tweeking at certain points, but CD's and digital music once locked in works great. The stereo seperation is fantastic/ These phones are worth every penny paid for it."
R148BBC7GW2OTH,5,"These headphones were a Father's Day gift for my dad who loves to watch TV really loud while working out. They were perfect and the quality was great. Can't go wrong with Sennheiser, especially these easy to use 'cans'. Just hooked up the transmitter to the RCA (Red/White) Audio Out of the cable box and muted the TV volume. The Cable Box runs audio simultaneously to the TV thru another audio out so he won't have to fumble with cables ever. The charging unit is really nice and construction seems sturdy."
R1VJ0XEK4Y2Q96,4,"These headphones are so light, they've slipped off my head while leaning over a few times, forgetting I have them on. Yes, very comfortable, AND durable. The sound is awesome, are they sure they're not noise-cancelling headphones? They are that fulfilling, and I live on a highway! The slight, very slight, hiss is only noticable between songs and only when you're conscience of listening for it. The clairity is way above expectations. Bought them for when there's multible listeners on different systems at the same time. Don't mind listening to them or my $600 studio speakers - it's a toss up. Walking around I do hear a buzz now and then, but it's only in tiny specific areas and surely less interference than with a transister radio. No problems when turning the headphones volume way up or down - as long as you set the sources volume to about one third. The stand/charge/headphone design is ingenius. Not a bad buy for less than $100."
R19YNWEJIMO2TI,4,"I liked these wireless headphones but had to bring them home from the office because of noise bleed. Someone two cubicles away said he could hear them at times!<br />Dropped signals were cured by setting the volume at the computer higher than the volume on the headset - perhaps that sent more over-the-air signal?<br />Finally, they were not as comfortable as I would have liked since the flat earpieces mashed my ears.<br />But most importantly, the sound was great!"
R2YD6JLRUZCA8V,3,"These headphones were my third pair, having worn out two other brands. I was hoping to get a top quality product from Sennheiser. My Sharp headphones were the best that I ever owned, great fit and sound quality with ear covering cushions. These Sennheiser units work well have OK sound but are lacking much bass response. They are ill fitting and I too, have had trouble with them falling off my head with the slightest downward movement. In all fairness, I am bald and that may affect the fit as my son, with a full head of hair, has no trouble keeping them on his head. If the Sennheiser RS120 units had over the ear cushions and better ergonomics I would rate them as 4-5 star. I wish they had a LED indicating whether on or off it would also be nice. All in all, I give them an OK rating but not as great as Sennheiser's reputation."
RGDZGIMNRTIX9,5,"Everybody wants to use the TiVo-equipped large screen TV in the family room these days. These headphones enable kids or anybody to do that without involving the whole family and without the whole family drowning out the TV-sound.<br /><br />We've had these for 5 years. Essential and trouble free.<br /><br />They're also great whenever the TV sound is a little hard to hear. Films with foreign accents or uneven sound levels, for example. Or for older TV watchers with less than perfect hearing.<br /><br />On most TVs, use the MUTE button to kill the speakers. Sound will still go to headphones through the audio-out connection."
RAIWTHF2OYGOI,4,"I've only had these wireless headphones a little over a week, but I already like them!<br /><br />The sound quality for TV and movies is very good--you'll pick up stuff you'd otherwise have missed! The mid-range and base are decent for a product in this price range.<br /><br />The transmitter/receiver range is outstanding--I can hear the program anywhere in the house!<br /><br />Comfort-wise, they are a bit roomy, and a snugger fit would be welcome.<br /><br />They are not feather-weight, but they're not overly heavy either. I can easily sit through a movie wearing these.<br /><br />As to the design, I would have put the volume control towards the bottom of the ear cup, and the tuner control higher up--just backwards of the way they're set up. I also would have made the volume control knob larger than the tuner control knob, because you're likely to fiddle with the volume far more often than the tuner. But this is minor stuff.<br /><br />Recharging is simple and convenient--simply hang the headphones up on the transmitter's charging stand, and forget about them until they've recharged.<br /><br />If your TV doesn't have a headphone jack, and you use the audio out jacks for the signal to the transmitter, you will need to have some volume turned up on the TV, which can then be further amplified with the headphone's volume control. But this is no big deal, as the TV can be at the lowest murmur, and you can amp up the sound plenty loud in these headphones!<br /><br />Installation and set up is simple, but the instructions are brief, to say the least. If you're a newbe to this kind of thing, you may have questions that aren't addressed in the instructions, but just take your time and you'll figure it out. There's only three connections to make--power, and the left and right audio out jacks. A handy converter is included for TVs with a headphone jack, should you want to use it.<br /><br />I ordered an extra headphone to go with the original transmitter/headphone, to accommodate an occasional guest, and as a back-up, should the batteries in one headset lose their charge. Note that one transmitter can service multiple headsets.<br /><br />In all, this is a very neat set up and it's got the look and feel of quality merchandise.<br /><br />PRO<br /><br />Very good performance at a great price!<br />Great transmitter/receiver range!<br />Obvious quality--especially for the price!<br />Simple installation--includes everything you need!<br /><br />CON<br /><br />Ergonomics--somewhat loose fit and control locations could be better.<br />Not overly heavy--but you won't forget you're wearing them.<br />Vague instruction manual for newbe consumers.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />I really enjoy being able to watch anything, anytime, without worrying about disturbing other people in the house!

RATXX2J5TT9HN,3,"I've had this product for almost 18 months now, and it's a love/hate relationship.  I use them primarily so that I can practice guitar at all hours without disturbing my family.  They allow me to do that, with some caveats, which is the only reason they're getting a positive review.  Battery life is good, and they're generally easy to use, but there are MANY cons:<br />  1. Sound quality - overall quality is not too bad, but bass response is very muted, which takes a lot of the \\""life\\"" out of listening and playing.<br />  2. Noise - just about ANYTHING interferes and injects a hum, warble, or some other minor distortion. 99% of the time I am less than 5 feet from the base.<br />  3. Auto-off \\""feature\\"" - if a loud-enough-for-its-own-taste signal is not received for a moment or two, the receiver portion of the headphones shuts down, prompting a HUGE and LOUD steady-static burst that hurts the ears.  This is plain STUPID engineering, and might be the biggest reason to avoid these. It's horrible.<br />  4. Ergonomics - the earpieces are flat, and not soft.  The phones will slide off your ears and head with relative ease, and are almost, but not entirely, uncomfortable.<br /><br />All that said, they are easily the best wireless headphones I've found in the relative price range, they remain durable and usable for the purpose, the charging/holding stand is brilliantly executed and easy to use, and they allow me to do what I bought them for.  Meh."
R1I2LI5FIYPXNO,5,"I have only had these for a couple of days and I have not seen one of the negative review issues that have been previously mentioned regarding hiss, drop out, or silence resulting in a disconnect. These replace a set of reconditioned Sony head sets that my new rescue sort of beagle enjoyed. Out of the box you simply install batteries and hook up left and right inputs in to TV, and plug in base unit...no directions are necessary, it is very easy.  The unit includes, converter to phono, and also a mini plug.  They have a soft flat ear piece that is very comfortable, not sure they will stay on if you are jogging but not doing that a present, will let you know if that becomes a problem. I read that several people had problems with back ground hiss during quiet scenes, in my expereince this is not an issue, this hiss is just not there, and the sound is remarkable. You quickly discover not all tv has high quality sound, and some dramas have so much back ground ambient, that it could sound like a hiss, but it's the party in the next room, or the street, or rain, or whatever, but it is not being produced by the head sets. During a quiet scene the head set does not turn off, I have paused it, and the result is silence and as soon as you start it back up the sound is there. Perfect, a real plus for those of us that are hard of hearing.  The charging station is well designed as you simply store ( hang)the head set and it charges. The unit has over charge protection. My old set had one nice design feature,  when you put them on they turned on, this design has a switch.. on and off. Not an issue. The tune and volume are close together, you get use to where the volume is and you only have to tune it once.  I got all the way to other side of the house and then walked outside a bit more and could still hear the TV clearly. So range is not an issue. Good set , well priced, hope you enjoy yours as much as I will enjoy mine.."
RIN12M2B9UBP8,4,"I have owned these for the last 11 months, they worked perfectly right out of the box (the splitter was in there, hidden in the packaging).    The point of this review is that in the last 10 days they suddenly started acting up, not getting a steady clear connection. (The batteries were the first thing I thought of). I live in a one bedroom apartment just north of DFW airport, second floor (three stories) and reception has not been a problem until now. I only use these on my computer for music, I'm not a TV person.    I've tried changing channels to find the best reception, but that doesn't seem to help. They have not been mistreated (dropped, etc.). Maybe someone in the building bought a new appliance that is interfering? Does anyone know what is up? Or is it time to buy a new set?"
R2EVDNS7KZ0J61,4,"I got these so I could enjoy the home cinema at late hours without disrupting the whole house and I got what I paid for. The sound quality is good, but not outstanding.  Sometimes I experience an ongoing \\""hiss\\"" for periods at a time, but haven't been able to trace it down (but haven't spent a lot of time at it either).  Very practical as I can run SirusXM Radio through my stereo and listen while I vacum the garage and the rest of the house (nice)."
R2AWHG08AG5TXI,2,"I have had other wireless head phones in the past and on a scale of one to 10, I would rate these a 5. These are too bulky and uncomfortable.  Also they slide off your head when you happen to look down. It would be a better product if the ear cups were hollowed out.  The band across the top of your head is very uncomfortable.  You can solve that by wearing a baseball cap but who wants to do that. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good.  I ended up buying a less expensive set of headphones for 37$. They are very comfortable and have very good sound quality.You can't beat the price and quality of Audio Unlimited."
R3T10Y348Y7AKO,5,"My husband and I sometimes watch TV in adjoining rooms and we can have a battle of the volume !!!!   Now, with these headphones, I can mute my TV and tune out his TV.   These headphones are clear and crisp and not heavy on the head.   You can adjust the volume, turn on and off and tune right from the headset.    I can walk into the kitchen - 2 rooms away - and still hear my TV.   These are GREAT and I highly recommend."
R2TYK54ELC07UK,5,WOW! These headphones are sooo good.  I bought the model with a charging cradle - and it is a much better choice than the model without a charging cradle.  I use these headphones everyday - and the charging cradle means that I don't really have to worry about batteries.  Oh yeah - I'm using these headphones in Australia - and so very glad to say that the a/c adapter is multi-voltage (110v - 240v).  Back to the headphones - the range and sound quality is very good.  And it does not feel very heavy either.  The price on Amazon is less than half price of what we pay in Australia.  Long live Amazon (and it's faithful retailers)!!!
R35IUI5MI9QKAP,5,"This is the second Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle I got, and very happy with the quality (material and sound) of these headphones, I even can do some garden work and get the news!   I still can't evaluate the batteries longevity but till now they are working and recharging just fine. The only cons I can find is that if you down your head to much, the device can slid down. But I recommend this product..."
R2RX2C2IZR6KYP,5,"Very good headphones for the price, and comfortable to wear in sitting/lying position.  The headphones do have a tendency to fall off if you are using them for other activities, like yardwork."
R29HAEZLRVFNA7,3,"I bought these headphones in Feb 2009 and was really thrilled at first.  I use them for TV, not music.  I could walk around the house listening to a program, even go outside many feet from the room.  Also, very good for when one person wants to watch TV while the other one sleeps or if one viewer needs the volume higher than the other.  I do like that.  However, battery life not so great and sometimes I don't use rechargeables.  The real problem is that now the on/off switch is broken and the sound fades to nothing within a few seconds of powering on.  I know it's the switch because of the static etc when I move the switch.  Of course, it'll cost more than they are worth to have them repaired, so now I'm without headphones.  I would dismantle them but where to find the micro-screwdriver?  Another purchase!  Then, if the problem is with the circuit board, I can't fix anyway.  It's all very annoying as I'm very used to them now! I don't think I'll buy these again.  I think they should last longer than a couple of years."
R4Z6UJYD10Q38,1,"these headphones are not designed correctly and do not stay on your head! they are extremely wide and loose, and do not even go over your ears! i have not listened to them but dont plan on it, i cant even move my head around with them on without them falling off! do not get these unless you have a gorilla head!"
RY8TSOUZKWK85,5,"Bought these for our daughter. Her fiance plays the piano (very well I might add) and will practice long hours. Their home is small and she can't do anything while he practices. She can now watch TV etc without being put in a straight jacket.  Also found out that when he stays up playing his video games, he uses them as not to wake her. He says it is like having surround sound.  I will be honest and tell you I haven't quizzed them on each little detail as the review has asked, but I do know that they are thrilled with them. They get married in a month and these headphones might be helping make it a very QUIET time before and after the wedding!! I have been married for 30 years..... I think I need a pair!! LOL"
R3KTB7FS4H2J3H,4,"These have good sound quality, and they have worked throughout the first floor where I use them without change in quality.  While a few reviews commented on background noise, I have not experienced these problems.  A few thoughts.  1) Simply because the audio may be IMPROVED with these headphone, I now notice the radio's background hiss/sounds that were less clear when listening to the speakers in large room.  This hiss is not the headphones, it's the quality of the sound source.  CDs are fine.  2) I spent time searching through the channels and tuning option to find the best/clearest reception.  Time spent on this activity will be rewarded"
R3SE36BTEFQOYC,5,"I NEVER write reviews but I am so happy with this product I felt the need to share. I have trouble making out the dialog during movies and TV and am (was) always asking my wife 'what did they say?', etc. I tried TV Ears last year and those were the most uncomfortable things I've ever willingly put into my ears! When the TV Ears literally fell apart from normal use I thought I was doomed to a life of TV volume so loud the neighbors' dogs would start barking. Then a co-worker mentioned he had a Sennheiser wireless headset and loved it. I did some research and ended up buying the RS-120. I am SOOOOO happy with this product. Easy to connect, flawless sound, NO hissing whatsoever, and so on.  Also, I mounted the transmitter/charging cradle behind my TV so it's completely out of sight and sound quality is just as good as when the transmitter was out in front of the TV. So, if you're reading this review and are even considering a wireless headset for TV/Stereo use, do yourself a HUGE favor and order these now.  As a side note, I bought this set last week via Amazon but it was fulfilled by another vendor as Amazon didn't offer them for sale (maybe because they were out of stock or something). I paid $82 and change. Today as I write this review I see the same set now offered for $76 via Amazon directly. It's not worth my time to mess around for the six bucks and I still feel I got a terrific bargain but YOU should definitely buy this set now!"
R1XAJEYNSCNWLQ,3,"I work in a crowded environment with lots of laptops and monitors, and it causes a lot of static. It's not too bad if the music is loud, but gets pretty annoying in between songs or during quieter moments. Not sure if it's just this product, or applies to all wireless headphones, but I'm definitely sticking with wires next time."
R23LJ5ZPWMV166,4,I have it almost a month and I like the sound but only you had to adjust the frequency just like an analog FM radio to match your reception. Overall I like this wireless headphone.
R2F4DQ4WB4SYR6,4,"I've liked the 120's for the past two years, good sound, very reasonably priced, and little to no hiss.  I use them with both my stereo (lp's and cd's) and tv/dvd so as to not disturb others.  Only negatives are with the tv when I mute the commercials a sudden loud hiss scares the #*%! out of me!  Also the headphones are too hot when i wear them in the workshop or cleaning up but fine for sitting around. I am now purchasing the rs 180's after reading a number of reviews hoping for even better performance and sound quality."
R14PMRGI9YQE40,4,"very pleased with the product, some hissing every once in awhile but it's not that distracting. one thing I didn't know was you have to have the volume on the tv up to at least a 4, otherwise you will get a loud blasting noise."
RC478L7W02QYT,1,There is no way to use these headphones with a   Samsung plasma HD TV.  I didn't return them because I thought they could be connected so now I'm stuck with looking at them on the charger.
R185GJEM6DW43U,4,"Found the sound quality and reception okay to good, but was expecting somewhat better sound especially in the bass performance.  Has a loose fit, but stays on for regular walking, standing, and sitting--not suitable for dance or exercise.  Keep in mind the headphones ship uncharged so you can't try them out the day they arrives.  Also, they mean it when they say it's subject to interference from nearby TVs.  For economy, this is a decent choice, but otherwise I'd try a more upscale model."
R2VGHKJV6XN4T0,2,"I was a little familiar with the name Sennheiser so I was expecting the quality of these headphones to be an upgrade from what I had previously owned, but sad to say, I've been disappointed. The sound quality is OK, as noted by the \\""star rating\\"" I gave them. Nothing great, but not bad to my ears, but any shifting of my head causes them to shift. Heaven forbid I actually get up or look down, as they will fall off. Perhaps I was unwise in my choice of styles. My last pair was the kind that sort of cupped the ear, and they were much more stable. Another major issue I have is with the recharging system. You have to set them on the cradle just right or it won't make contact, and then they won't charge. There have been many times when the were placed on the cradle, the red charging light came on, indicating they were being charged, but the next time I went to use them they had shifted or something so they were no longer charging. I know these are by no means \\""top of the line\\"" headphones, but I expected more than I feel I got for my money, and of course this is the sort of thing which makes me reluctant to order things on-line without trying them on first, and then once I have them it's a little inconvenient to return them, especially if there is additional cost involved. Anyway, I usually shy away from doing reviews, I don't usually feel strongly enough about a product one way or another to take the time and expend the energy, but I have been unhappy enough with these that I wanted to express my thoughts on the product. Maybe it'll be helpful to someone else before they buy."
R3N6R55SJV6YL,3,"I'm female and think I have an average-size head, but the Sennheiser SR120 Wireless Headphones do NOT fit my head. They are too big, so I wear a hat in order to keep them in place. I also have occasional interference that I have not figured out yet when I walk around. Otherwise the sound for me is good and the controls are well placed, and I like the headset charging cradle."
RXGR3W8RKMPTD,2,"The wireless did not work for me.  I had static coming through the headset.  I tried the three different channels available with the system.  I had to return the headphones.  If it wasn't for the static the sound quality and Bass is very good.  However, I could not eliminate the static in the background and had to return the product.  The return service is great.  Will shop again from the seller through Amazon."
RPBCJ3PDPKICN,5,"have my set in my shop listening to music while i work and my wife has a set in the kitchen and listens to books on tape while gardening and cooking and since they have different channels to choose from they do not interfere with each other when we come near to each other, very happy with the prducts sound and reception and comfort. this is a product that is well worth the money."
R3B1595SUIEMYU,1,"Since I have had it delivered , I have not been able to make it work.  I have pluged it in as show   on the little instructions, and still nothing.  I have moved the small little bar at the bottom   on the base, still nothing.   I pluged it into my TV's  ear phone plug, but the TV  sounds goes   silent and the sound comes ONLY through the wireless head set.   NOt at all what I wanted.  Now my   husband can't hear TV while I listen to it on the earphone.  When i put the earphones on to recharge   I see the 2 small light, but when i go to put the headset on  nothing,  I very disapointed, I want to throw it away, but I paid good money for it.   I don't see a number that I could of called to help me with this wireless earphones , I was really looking forward to enjoying, while my husband enjoyed the TV at the sound that was tolerable to his ears.   If you care about your products, then send me some instructions on what to do to make this product work.  You know my email, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Or send me the return   slip , so I can get my money."
R2NY4AL76R3PUV,2,"Sennheiser has a great reputation for headphones which really adds to my disappointment for this particular model.    Good points:    1) very convenient way to recharge headphones   2) replaceable batteries   3) good sound quality    Bad points:   1) annoying beeps - when you turn it on/off & when you're not receiving an audio source.  Is this a design fad?        Everything from microwave ovens to cars have annoying indicator beeps or honks these days.  At least allow the (intelligent)       user to turn down and turn off the beeps.   2) can't turn the volume all the way down - you still hear sound at the lowest volume level.  So when I'm watching TV and      want to cut the volume for commercials, I have to turn off the headset (BEEP!) to completely cut off the sound.  And when      the program comes back, I have to turn back on the headset (BEEP!) to listen again.  What a moronic design!!!    The bad (and unforgivable) points outweigh the good for me.      In contrast, I have great IR headphones from Pioneer (SE-DHP800) that don't have the beep and volume problems.  The only drawback  is that I have to remain in line of sight of the transmitter since they're not RF."
RD5BQM3WMBJ9A,5,"I got this as an upgrade from our first model for the charging cradle. Makes it easier to charge (no more searching for charged batteries) and I love the quiet, as it's for my husband.  He loves the sound quality and listening to his shows while he's in other rooms or walking out to the mailbox.  Peace reigns in our house now, at least for those not wearing the headphones."
R1LGJ6B6JRMJH,5,"For about 10 years, my job required me to wear headphones every day, all day, and I tried every type and brand there was.  Sennheisers were by far the best, with a combination of excellent sound quality, all-day comfort, and long-term reliability.  And unlike other brands, you can always order replacement parts if needed.  These wireless headphones replace a cheap set that were uncomfortable and unreliable.  The Sennheisers worked great right out of the box, with range that reaches anywhere on my property, inside or out, with crystal clear sound and terrific stereo separation.  The recharging system is foolproof, and the transmitter was very easy to set up.  The only downside is that the headphones, in order to be comfortable, do not clamp down; thus, if you bend over or lean back, they may slip on your head.  I would also like to have a tiny LED on the headphones themselves to let you know they are on, so you don't accidentaly leave them on when you aren't using them. These are minor gripes, however, and don't really detract from their overall quality.  The more expensive brands, like Bose , may offer a technically better sound response, but I doubt anyone could actually hear the difference, and it certainly wouldn't be worth the higher price.  I have a set of wired Sennheisers that I have used regulary for 20 years, and they sound just as good as when I bought them.  I had to replace the foam rubber ear pads once, but they were readily and inexpensively available through the Sennheiser website.  You simply cannot go wrong with Sennheisers."
R2A1OACJH8PNGB,5,"MY THIRD SET OF HEADPHONES AND BY FAR THE BEST. USE PRIMARILY FOR TV , THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT AND I HAVE YET TO HEAR THE STATIC OR POPS THAT WERE COMMON ON PRIOR UNITS. A BEST BUY!!"
R2CPKV86MQYIEK,5,"I've tried two previous wireless headphones specifically designed for TV listening, an inexpensive set and one expensive set supposedly amplifying harmonics of frequencies people commonly loose with age.  The expensive set could not be rotated to adjust to fit and were just uncomfortable.  They sounded better than the $35 set, but not four times better.<br /><br />The expensive set were broken so when I got a new TV, I bought these after reading reviews of many options. Ten minutes or less after opening the box, I was listening to the TV. The biggest surprise was that the sound is so much more superior to the headphones I had! The controls are no problem. Once set, I haven't needed to change them. I've heard no hiss at all. I can get the mail at the street or check the garden and still hear the news, something not possible with IR headsets.  Charging couldn't be easier.  The comfort is much better than the other headsets; good but not great. At half the cost of the last headphones, which I had to use batteries in, I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />I would unhesitatingly recommend these headphones to friends or family, especially if they are driving their spouse crazy with the TV volume :-)<br /><br />EDIT:  June 2013<br />Still love these.  Even listen to music through them now."
R2ECRER5RUTZBH,5,"Purchased the headphones as a Christmas gift for my husband. He had the television volume set to deafening decibels. The headphones are comfortable to wear, easy set-up, no static, and have great distance range. I purchased a second set for our vacation home and the headphones have saved my hearing and sanity!!! The charging cradle is great because you don't have to keep replacing batteries. It is a gift that benefits everyone in the household."
R12VU0VP757WJE,5,"The head set is better than expected. Love everything about them, I can even go outside at quite a distance and still the clarity is very good.  Glad I made this purchase.  The sound is great for watching American Idol!!"
R1OPTU3A327FST,4,"I am happy with the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with charging cradle.It has most of the attributes I need except for max comfort of the earphones. I would prefer them to be cupped around the ears instead of lying flat. Ofcourse this would seal out the sound and I prefer to hear what is going on around me and not be absolutely isolated. But they don't feel as secure on my head as I would like, just a bit flat across the top of my head (and I don't have a pointy one!)<br /><br />You have to be careful to put the earphones on the charger correctly. Their weight on the charger has to be just right, showing the red light. It will go green when charged. I have two pairs and I like that you only have to charge one to have the other one function at the same time.<br /><br />The sound is crystal clear with not too much bass. I only use them for TV so far.<br /><br />UPDATE: Love them even more after nearly 3 years use! Quite comfortable and having a set of two has been a godsend for our family. We have a sleeping loft above our living room and my husband goes to bed at 9.30PM Two people can enjoy TV together without losing the whole evening. Never had any issues!"
R3J3Z0DBY6KJIR,1,"I'm one of the many people who saw the many 5 star reviews and immediately rushed to buy these headphones. I quickly became one of the many people who realized that it's impossible to use this product!<br /><br />It is absolutely impossible for you to keep these on your head, defeating the purpose of wireless headphones. The problem lies in the design of the ear part of the headphones: they're not indented at all! This means there is no way for them to hug your ear and stay on your head like a normal set of headphones.<br /><br />The ear area is completely flat and isn't made of a material that would at least attempt to stick to your skin like leather might. As soon as you put them on your head you immediately notice how unlikely they are to stay put. As soon as you nod your head forward (like some people might do when they listen to music!) they'll slide right off. If you want to listen to music from your computer while doing things around the house, forget it!<br /><br />What's the point of cordless headphones if simply moving your head around causes them to fall off?<br /><br />I only used them for about 2 minutes before realizing they sucked and I couldn't keep them on my head. I did notice the hissing that people are always talking about, but it goes away when the music comes on. I walked into the next room in my house (about 25-30 ft away) and the quality didn't change at all.<br /><br />So if you plan on listening to music nonstop, the sound quality isn't bad. But if you're like me and sometimes you want to pause a song so you can read/do something, you have to listen to the annoying hiss.<br /><br />Cliffs:<br /><br />-The headphones are worthless because they DO NOT STAY ON YOUR HEAD. If you sit extremely still and don't plan on getting up or moving your head or really ANYTHING, they stay on your head.<br /><br />-There is an annoying hiss when you're not listening to something."
R3AUGKUNOET8R8,5,"I am not technology savvy by any means.  I asked my husband to set this up for me and he gave me some lengthy explanation about why it may not be compatible with our tv.  Tired of waiting for him, I set it up, by myself, in two minutes.  Sound quality is great and it's completely comfortable.  LOVE IT!"
R1G7U74IO70O6M,4,"These work great and sound great, but they don't stay put so well. I use them for Rock Band drumming and while practicing other musical instruments. They often are sliding off my head.  The cordless charging system is fabulous, as are the on-headphone controls.  With an adapter, they work great with my laptop and iPhone."
R1PJ5XDOTFCZDQ,3,Finally now I can watch a movie without her complaining that it is too loud or me wondering if it was a silent movie when the volume is comfortable for her.  A little hiss & if I turn the volume down I hear what sounds like an echo. But good overall reception with range over 100' so I can even go out to the shop & still hear.
R1GAF818HBPE3S,5,"I wanted a pair of tv audio headphones for $20- because I was happy with the RCA's I had for ten years. My wife bought the expensive ones for me BUT what a difference!    The sound quality is fabulous- good base and great high end  The transmitter goes through the house and into the back yard!  (Gardening with tv audio)    And they recharge automatically when placed on the base.    Terrific system, and I recommend it."
R3VV2BXCVO6BJE,5,"I bought these headphones around 9 years ago.  Maybe as much as 11 years ago....I've been living in my current home for 9 years and bought them before I lived here so it's at least that long.  These are not High Fidelity headphones.  I use them strictly for television and that's what this review is about.  Anyone who thinks they'll get audiophile headphones in wifi for $70 is kidding themselves. If you're an audiophile your used to paying over $1000 for headphones and amps anyway so you're not reading this.  However, if you want to lie in bed and watch TV while your wife sleeps or you don't want her to tell you to turn down the volume all day then these are worth $1000.00.  If you want to go to the bathroom; grab some oreo's; get the mail; answer the doorbell; etc etc then these are also worth $1000.00.  The range is great.  I love listening to ballgames while making dinner.   I paid $120 way back then and it was worth every penny and when these eventually break I will buy another pair that day.  Even my rechargeable batteries that came with it are still working great!  9+ years?  Beat that.  The only legitimate complaint with about them is Volume and tuning are right next to each other.  Even after 9 years I still hit the wrong one every now and then.  However they are so easy to tune back in I wouldn't remove a star for that."
R2Q0FNCBRCJJUD,3,"They fit fine, charge up fast enough but for this price I don't think a tone control knob is too much to ask for. As is, the speakers are heavy on the base side and need some treble control. If you were just watching the news you could hear fine. But if you have lost some hearing, and are trying to watch something like Camelot or the Borgia's where there always seems to be some whispering in a dark corner, these things are worthless. There is a slight hiss sound, but I could have got over that if the speaker sound had been better. I sent them back."
R2QIM7UBKWJKBQ,5,"I like my Sennheiser RS 120 headset a lot.  My wife likes them, and she never wears them.  She can turn the TV volume down to a comfortable level, while I can hear parts of the sound that I have not heard for years.  I can also listen to a game and she does not even need to hear it at all.  Some have complained about the volume control being too close the the tuning control, but it has not been a problem for me. The tuning control does not need to be changed much at all."
R3OKUGZC6P1687,4,"I got these wireless earphones for my father to use when we travel together. Even with his hearing aides, he needs to raise the TV sound to unbearable levels to hear it. My only criticism of the earphones is their size. They and the charger are larger than I anticipated. Again, wanting something for travel, I may have to leave these earphones at home and pack earplugs instead."
R1QXV5EA62RSSO,5,"TV in back room, wore headsets and was able to hear out front by my mailbox! Only had mild static which went away when I adjusted the tuning dial."
RXR21QBH28OBF,1,"In this new age of the internet, all users expect the honesty of truth in advertising to carry over from the old days when we had no internet less knew what computers were. Back then when someone went to purchase an item from a store, people could ask about the item, heck, even test it out to see if it worked the way it was advertised to work.  Unfortunately, buying over the internet deprives us of that luxury. Therefore, we depend on the advertisement to be truthful to its word.  In a perfect world this would make internet shopping much simpler, but unfortunately this is not the case.     I purchased a set of wireless headphones which advertised to make my life a lot simpler and more fun by not having to be limited by a five foot wire. I was promised high performance stereo sound as I sat in the next room from my stereo, tv or computer. I guess maybe it was too good to be true but I decided to take a chance and try out the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz wireless RF headphones at a whopping sale price of $79.00.     Well, I am here to attest to the fact that if it's too good to be true, then it's probably not.  These headphones were a bad experience in that nothing but the battery charger worked the way it was advertised to perform.  Needless to say I felt very dissatisfied with this product which was returned for a refund I used to purchase a dependable headphone set."
R2H1OLXCCICE0J,5,"Works very well with the TV in the bedroom.  The headphones could be better if they were adjustable for fit, much too loose now."
RXTXMYE5ZRSGK,5,"As a career broadcaster, I've known Sennheiser products all my life.  Their quality is simply superb, and these consumer level headphones are equal to their professional gear."
R2YQX0U8OPCYKS,1,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser and being a fan, I know alot about them. I bought two of them one after another, hoping that I would get the quality as they promise, I know its big in size and I don't care, I dont care if it needs to be plugged in, but the only thing I wanted is quality. I was busy with my studies, but it's high time I spoke of it. I like sennheiser, but I don't like this product. Stop producing !"
RYFZIELCNWJOK,5,"Found this product easy to \\""install\\"" and simple to use.  Sound quality is great and the charging system is easy to work... simply put the earphones on the rack.  Battery life seems good as they have not failed yet.  Distance is very reasonable, able to continue listening through three rooms with solid walls.  I would recommend them and would not hesitate to buy another Sennheiser product."
R30636P9UTHB2S,1,I bought these headphones for my father-in-law for his Christmas present last year as he lives with us and his hearing is not good.  The earphones stopped working in less than a week and Sennheiser simply did not respond to any entreaties I made for help.  Sent them back.  What a bummer...
R2JGU90LTN65Q4,5,"I have had these headphones for slightly longer than a month.  I wanted them because my family can get pretty loud sometimes and it became irritating to not be able to hear what was being said in television shows and movies.  This was the perfect solution.  They can plug directly into the DVR/Cable Box and also into our Sony Playstation 3 for watching films on Blu-ray.  The Playstation required an inexpensive adapter to achieve connection, but it works very well.  You can listen to TV at a louder volume than the rest of the family or you can turn down the sound levels on your surround sound system to completely inaudible levels or even mute and it does not effect the head phones, as their volume level is independent of the rest of the system.  I have found the sound quality to be so impressive that I often use the headphones when no one else is around simply because the sound is superior to the surround sound system.  The controls are easy to use and the charging cradle is very convenient.  I take them off the charger in the morning and replace it before going to bed.  I have even skipped a day and the batteries have never failed.  It is not often that I have been so pleased with a product that I would take the time to offer a review.  Truely exceptional."
R1MURG6JXLBNK5,4,"My old Sony wireless died. With regrets I did research and based my purchase of the RS 120 on the Sennheiser brand name and purchaser's reviews.  Pro - The range is great and far greater than my old headset. The volume control is really great for tuning down the commercials volume. The sound quality is really good. Amazon had the best price for this headset, Radio Shack wanted over $100 for them.  Con - I agree with the reviewer who said the ear covers should be leather because this material is slightly irritating and I am going to cover mine with a soft material. I also dislike the fact that they fall off easily if you are not just sitting and listening. I like to cook and clean when wearing my headset and as soon as I put my head down the headset falls off. I made a strap to secure them.  Overall, I love the headset and recommend it."
RWJZ2AS8D5E9Z,4,"This is my 2nd pair of Sennsheiser's and I still think highly of them. The previous pair had a better fit (though they weren't wireless). These feel strange as they feel like they aren't \\""form fit\\"" on the ears. More of an open style. They fall off easily when you lean forward, so have to be careful there. The sound quality is superb. Very clear and crisp at low volume levels. Well worth the price!"
R1T20XQP7AU6EX,4,"The headphones were a birthday gift for my husband. He is very pleased with them and since I often have to go to sleep before he does, these headphones work out really well. He does not have to compromise on sound quality and I do not have to compromise trying to sleep with a lot of background sounds from the TV or stereo.     I would recommend these headphones to anyone. I couldn't afford the higher end models, but the RS120 are more than adequate."
R3N5JL4SNQ176J,5,"I have had the RS110 for 4-5 years and the RS 120 for 3-4 years now. Love both of them. Have enjoyed good range from them, walls don't make a big difference but then I'm not an audiophile and tend not to use these for music. Since I have both - I can easily switch either headset to either source transmitter. Currently 1 of my sources is linked to my receiver's zone 2 output - so I can listen to all my input hooked to it and in case either headset runs out of battery I can quickly switch over to the other one.    I use it for listening to the news (radio or tv). I am extremely happy with my purchases, though the fit could be better it does make me think that perhaps if the fit was tighter I would not find them as comfortable. The battery charge (RS110 uses batteries) lasts a while as do the inbuilt batteries in the RS120, it helps that I can recharge batteries for both headsets.    Well worth the purchase for me and the flexibility is much welcomed."
R1QL9RACI3XAYK,5,"Since my wife can no longer adequately hear the TV without the volume to at least 11, hearing aids or headphones were the only options.  After dismissing hearing aids, we wanted wireless headphones with decent sound and range that didn't require a battery change every few uses.  These headphones fit the bill.  The rechargeable batteries  recharge on the stand when not in use, you can walk around the house without a loss of the strong clear signal and they sound great.  They do require some initial tuning to get the best signal and sound quality, but after that. . . you're good to go!"
RMG0A5CKBUGJT,5,"These turned out to be perfect for what I wanted them for. I can do my housework and even cook on the grill outside while listening to great music from I-tunes. Another great use is watching TV after my husband has gone to bed. I don't have to worry about waking him up anymore due to the TV being to loud. I've just been so pleased with the sound and reception, I wish I had purchased them a long time ago!"
R30KJ5OQHA2VUR,5,Best headset I've ever owned. I used to have the RCA and other brand but none has come close to this one. I was amazed with how clear the sound is. It seems as if I was using a wired headphones. The battery life seems last long enough and it's very easy to charge just place it on the holder which serves as a charger as well. I'm very happy with this headphones.
R213WDAZB7OITQ,4,"I ordered this headset TV listening item along with another advertised TV hearing system.  After using both, I found this product to be far superior to the other brand. This one has good reception and I can move around any where in my home without losing reception.  The only drawbacks I have is it hard to adjust the headset and earphones to your head and ears and it didn't come with a warrenty and instruction manuel."
RZ9PWLXX1DFT6,4,It works well watching TV in bed. My only problem is that they should make them with cupped ear pads. The ear pads are flat and slide off or down quite a bit when moving the head that's prop with pillows. I ordered from Electronics Expo since Amazon didn't offer at the time. Would order again from them..
R1ZC4J4T8DRK9G,4,"I bought these ear phones so I could stop the \\""volume\\"" wars every night with my wife as we both watched separate TV shows or I played Call of Duty.  I found that the sound is great, but is really susceptible to interference. From what I've read it's a problem with all wireless head sets. These were a great substitute for the Logitech \\""gaming\\"" headset that costs twice as much. I run the voice that usually comes through the ear piece into the head set, then attach the Bluetooth ear-bud to my collar and things work fine."
R3GXXT94YN2HFN,5,These headphones work very well and hold a good charge. They may have a slight hissing sound but give a good sound when other sounds are in a nearby room. They were shipped in a timely manner.
R1H43SM21RSBL7,2,"The reviews were kind of confusing so I decided to go for them. It was a bad choice. I sent them back the second day. The sound quality is not good. It leaks a LOT of noise. I was listening to music at work (moderate volume) and my colleague who was sitting 4 feet away from me could hear everything loud and clear. He complained about the disturbance. Also, they make your ears really warm and sweaty to the point when it becomes really uncomfortable around the ears. I would not recommend them to anybody. I just hope Amazon returns my money without any problems."
R3QH0P1022BHII,5,"I owned another pair of wireless headset (infrared) before.  It broke after a few years of use, so I decided to buy this one after reading the reviews.  Compared to my own pair, this one doesn't have any dead zone (at least I haven't found one yet).  Sound quality is good, and love it being rechargeable."
R3EHSSVZGUMR6H,4,"This is our second set of Sennheisers. We had our first set for almost ten years, after which we had some battery issues.    These are great. Long battery life, and they don't take proprietary batteries like our old set.    One complaint is that the tuner and volume knobs are too close together. I imagine we'll get used to that.    Worse is the shape of the earpieces--they're flat. This means they slide off your head if you look down. Not a problem for couch potatoes, but I wear them to listen to the news while making dinner because the TV is not within view of the kitchen. I'm considering gluing a ring of foam on the earpieces.    Other than this, we love our Sennheisers."
R33D3HZ1SNRHM6,5,"I bought these specifically to use for listening to tv while on the treadmill.  I did alot of research, both here and other places, about wireless headphones.  I am not techno savvy in the least, so I was worried about the audio problems and getting these headphones to work with the new flat screen TV's, and all the other problems others have encountered trying to hook them up.  I decided to give them a go.  I hooked them right into the back of our direct tv receiver, charged the batteries, and they work like a charm. No static.  It was so simple.  I can walk throughout my whole house and have no problems.  No more turning our tv up to decibles that will break the sound barrier while walking on the treadmill.  The sound is fantastic, better than listening to the audio coming out of the tv when not using them.  Great price, great product.      P.S.  This is the first review I have ever written for a product, I am that pleased with them."
RD0W84LSKIF62,3,"I purchased these headphones to replace my Sony MDR-RF970R's. I was hoping for better quality considering my older headphones were a few years older. I didnt like what I got when I got it. The batteries were wight behind the foam ear cover on one side and both covers would come off too easy when pulling the headphone off or making adjustment while wearing them. When you put them on you had to tune them in to the right frequency. My old Sony's just did that themselves, something I liked because I didnt have to mess with it being that these new headphones had the volume control right next to the frequency tuner. There was barely any bass and there was static in the backround all the time. They also felt awkward on my head. I did like the fact it was wall mountable and the way it recharges is pretty innovative. I going to buy and stick with the Sony. These arent bad, they just arent what I thought I would be getting for the money."
R1L07UDT5ETBWF,4,"Good sound, good bass. Love the stand/ charger. So simple and looks great. The wireless range is insane. I walked four rooms and two floors away and it still came in CLEAR. Just insane.<br /><br />My only problem is the ear pad design. Its completely flat. So the sound bleeds out everywhere. Anyone in the room can hear what you are listening to."
R2B2ROY15ZU705,4,"I bought this headphones as I need to listen to my TV without disturbing my wife who studies in the hall.     The packaging arrived in sturdy condition, only for me to open it and see one of the ear cushions half opened. I thought it was broken and being that I hate returns, I cursed my luck - only to find that the earpads were detachable. *whew*!    (i) CONS: The setup is easy, though the included manual isn't really the best. I had it connected via digital-to-audio Gefen converter to my HDTV.   I wasn't really sure when the green light on the transmitter is supposed to come 'on', and even now I am not completely certain. This is why I am not pleased with the manual. My setup had a faulty Toslink cable and the green light wouldn't light up - because of which I thought there was something wrong with the transmitter. Trial and error nailed down the problem to the faulty Toslink cable, which I have since replaced and everything is working as it should be. A little more clarity in the manual (instead of printing it in 25 languages, half of which no one would really care about) would have been appreciated.    (ii) The included batteries are rechargeable (NiMH) no name 600mAh AAA batteries - are you kidding me ?! 600mAh ?! I would hard pressed to find 600mAh batteries fron any acceptable brand right now in the market. I don't expect them to last too long so I have gone ahead and purchased a set of 1000mAh batteries from Tenergy    (iii) Which design wiz decided to place the volume control and the tuning control next to each other on the right earpad ?! I mean a little user testing would have shown up this glaring error! I am having a headache thinking of the number of times I will use one of these controls mistaking it for the other....    (iii) PROS: The audio quality across the entire range - from bass to mids to high, is definitely good - not audiophile quality mind you but then I wouldn't expect that at this price range. It does what it is supposed to do and does a very good job of it. Directional audio is well captured - useful while gaming or for immersion in video(I dont know if this is a TV parameter or a headphone parameter but I am mentioning it just in case..)    (iv)I live in a small condo so I do not walk around much using this but whatever little walking I did do, didn't produce any interference - barring the one instance when I could hear someone's phone conversation!! No kidding! It was some lady in the same apartment complex as I live in. I quickly tuned away but it was unnerving to say the least.    Overall, I am pleased with the final product, if not with some of the finer issues."
R2M27B1WUGTPZA,4,"I purchased these Sennheiser RS120 headphones to hear the TV without blasting my spouse out of the house. Because of my hearing impairment, I would normally turn the TV all the way up to 100% volume.<br /><br />I do like these headphones. I can now hear the TV nicely at 25% volume. I wear the headphones for hours very comfortably. Sound quality is good. Reception is excellent anywhere in the house. Automatic recharging of the batteries is ingenious! I enjoy these headphones. Buy a set for yourself!<br /><br />Here are my two small reservations:<br /><br />1. The instructions are not complete enough for a person who isn't familiar with hooking up electronic devices. I would prefer a more definitive set of instructions. For example, the power supply was buried in the packaging. Nowhere did the instructions say to look for a power supply and hook it up. I thought maybe the power came through the audio cables. What do I know? Also, the instructions do not give any clue where to connect the wires to the TV.<br /><br />2. My TV is about 10 years old - still analog. Therefore, the volume of the headphones is directly related to the volume of the television. If the television is muted, the headphones are muted. If the television volume is low, the headphone volume is low. So to use the headphones, the television volume needs to be a little bit louder than my spouse would like. If we get a new digital TV, this will no longer be a problem.<br /><br />I love being able to actually hear the TV without being constantly told to turn it down. Buy these headphones. You will like them!"
R16HNR0O1S3OBB,1,I got a pair of these 2 years ago because a person at work had them and swore by them.  I have had problems since I got them and now they have just died.  I would have to wiggle the plug to get any sound out.  They picked up my coworkers stations but not mine even though we were on different channels.  Lot's of noise so had to re-fiddle with it always.  If you didn't have any sound playing loud static would come on after 5 min.     I am looking for another pair now but won't be getting these ones again.
R27AKPECRTH1L8,3,"I bought a Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones recently and I have not been able to   connect it to Sony Bravia Home theater Systems which does not have a headphone jack or RCA typy audio out. I have connected it to my Bravia TV that has RCA audio out, but can not get the sound when using the home theater unit.     I would have thought that Sennheiser would have updated its products to keep up with technology!"
R796DTSXULHET,5,"I've got severe hearing loss and for years I've tried various headsets in order to keep the TV volume from blasting everyone from the room.  Most of these headsets have allowed me to hear the TV audio OK while the TV volume is turned down. However, even with the headset volume turned all the way up, most speech and music was difficult to understand. It took a lot of effort to try to hear what was being said or played.    While shopping the web, I came across the Sennheiser RS120 wireless unit and noticed many good reviews about it and, out of frustration, decided to pay the $84 and take a chance. It was worth it. It's like I've regained my hearing: now I can easily and clearly hear any voice or music; crisp, clear, without straining and with plenty of volume to spare. Up until I started using the Sennheiser RS120, I didn't know that \\""Family Guy\\"" was in stereo.    Totally satisfied with this set and I'm gonna buy another set to give to my brother.  I know he too is going to be amazed at the sound quality that he's been missing for years."
R3BWW8DOBWXLPM,5,"If you are having trouble hearing TV at a lower volume and have to crank up the volume to 70 just to hear the program, this set works great. Every one can enjoy TV at a sound level comfortable for all."
R1GW63WGVUPKRW,5,I've had another brand that was all kinds of problem. I've also had a earlier version of this one that died after many years. This is a quality product at a reasonable price.
R37L86BO7KTN6,3,"the head phones work great, excellent sound, only problem is they do not fit well, if you get up and move you have to hold your head very stable or head phones fall off.  i would think for nearly $100 they could come up with a design that would allow you to move about a little bit and not have to hold these phones on your head."
R1UKGH1TQN0DX3,1,"My problem with this head set is it is made for someone with a very large head. I am a 71/4 hat size and they are too large,because of this fact I leaned over, they fell off and fell two feet to hard wood floor and no longer work."
R29UX39UUM1VPB,3,"Sound was great and I was able to walk outside in the back yard and still hear it without any issues.  I was making cookies once, though, and the mixer interfered with the sound (caused a bit of temporary static).<br /><br />I biggest complaint is this:  I use these to listen to the TV while running around the house doing chores (laundry, dishes, vacuuming, sweeping/mopping)... And every time I bent over just the slightest, these would fall right off my head.  I don't have a small head, either.  And these were very uncomfortable to wear with earrings (I just wear studs).<br /><br />So I'm sending them back and getting RS 130 model that will completely encase my ears and hold onto them.  I have had these in the past but they broke, so I went with the $50 cheaper model (this one)... but am very disappointed in the comfort factor.  Otherwise, they're great... but that's much too big of an obstacle for me to ignore."
R35YV3AB2DV5IV,4,My only gripe about these headphones is that the instructions for setting them up are extremely lacking. Once I figured out how to set them up and tune them in the product works excellently and I am very pleased with my purchase.<br />The distance one can walk away from the base is very good. The sound quality is excellent. I love the rechargeable batteries. Just stick the headphones on the base when you are finished with them and they are ready to go the next time you need them.<br />I would definitely recommend them to anyone considering purchasing a set of wireless headphones.
RQGUDU2NGLVBC,1,"As stated in the title, so far this purchase sucks...headphones not working on my laptop!!  Will now try on my tv!"
R1AHARSBF5NKUM,5,"My husband has a hearing impairment and a friend told us about this product.  We purchased it and have not been dissapointed.  My husband uses this wireless headphone and can hear all the programs on TV without having to use captions. That being said, we both love them!! You won't be dissapointed."
R3S4WXOAS8281C,4,"Bought these for my mom who suffers from severe hearing loss. She'd been using  Sony but we didn't like the way you had to fight with the charging cradle.<br /><br />  So after looking we settled on these Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle.<br /><br />  They hooked up super easy. We had to adjust some settings to get them just right.<br /><br />  We would have given a 5 star rating but the ear pads are lacking. Making the ear phones hard to keep on, so we took one posters advice and covered the exsisting ear pads with the ones from the Sony pair. Not only more comfortable they fit her head better.<br /><br />  Even though she's legally blind she's able to set them on the charging cradle super easy.<br /><br />  Once we got all that figured she loves them. She's not complained about them shutting off once. The sound quality is great even when she leaves the room.<br /><br />But I am upset since buying ours a few weeks ago there now selling for $20 less.<br /><br />Still a good buy would recommend.<br /><br />04/26/11 Revision...My mom just mentioned a week ago that she is picking up some of our next door neighbors phone calls. But if she just tilts her head a little the sounds goes away...she says that it doesn't really bother her...sure would bother me.. still would recommend this as a good buy.<br /><br />2/11/15 just after Christmas these finally gave out. 3 years of use"
RADQCHXD4JPC9,5,"I purchased these for my Husband who has a hearing problem and just loves to turn the TV up to the Max while I am trying to sleep at night...Thank You, Thank You.  This is a great product and the sound quality is wonderful.  I would reccommend this product for anyone."
R1Y83T4O8B0TAL,1,"Bought two new (not refurbished) RS 120 after doing extensive research online to find the best wireless headphones to replace the Sony's I had. Figured you also get what you pay for, well not here! If you like to listen to TV as if you were siting in the middle of a blizzard, this product is for you! forgot where the mute button is on the remote and are looking for alternative entertainment? You will love the challenge of trying to decipher the dialogues on your favorite TV show through Larsen effects and hiss, guaranteed hours of playful entertainment ahead...Enjoy!"
R1KV3B92XQYFWM,2,"Although I did not truly understand all the applications of these headphones...I immediately found the quality in the just the physical attributes very poor.  They came in an envelope (not a box) as though it didn't matter whether they arrived intact or not, limited reception...overall, I felt they were just cheap Chinese goods wrapped around a great name in quality."
R1MNP20R5KNLEL,5,"After 2 broken Sony headsets, I decided not to purchase another.  This set is larger, but seems much more durable.  I'm the night owl in the family, and like to watch TV late while everyone else  is sleeping, so I use these all the time. I never really had a hearing problem,   but as I got older the TV volume increased. Using these wireless headsets not only solves the  noise in the house problem, but I can hear and understand all the words better than live TV audio.  Action audio like gunfire, etc. sounds so much better with the headphones. Nice stereo effect.  Laying them on the recharge cradle is also easier than getting them just right like the Sony.  Very pleased with this set."
R2IEAQOSNFOI50,5,"Once I found the correct place to plug into the TV, tuning was easy as was setting volume. To bad there isn't an easily accessible \\""mute\\"" button for the overly loud commercials. Now I just slip the phones off. Gives my ears a rest anyway. My wife, who is early to bed, sleeps directly above the TV room so I have to keep the sound down to a level she can tolerate. That means I have to sit 6 feet closer and the TV becomes Cinerama. My eyes were reverse crossing. Now I can sit where I choose; go to the kitchen for snacks; even \\""powder my nose\\"" and not miss anything. We later discovered that speech is more clearly separated from the background music through the phones - now she catches some of the murmured speech she had missed before."
R2F6HT9T09K7G5,5,"Recommended by All Pro Sound, where I bought my home theater system. Wife has severe hearing loss and did not want TV Ears because the ear buds go in the ear, requiring her to remove hearing aids. She uses this product with hearing aids in and they work fine. No whistle from the hearing aids. The only significant problem (for me anyway) is that she can't hear me talk to her when we are both watching TV. One design problem - the tuning control is easy to move when she is feeling for the volume control. I set it once and then taped over it to keep her from moving it. Since Sennheiser makes both the transmitter and receiver they should be able to set the frequency at the factory and omit the control. Overall a good solid product, well worth the price."
RA0JBJI4NGNEC,5,"These are by far the best wireless headphones we have tried, out of possibly 4 other kinds.  They out perform in sound quality, and you can walk all around the house and the sound is not altered.  They are perfect for seniors who require louder volumes, and for anyone else who may want to watch tv late into the night without disturbing anyone else."
RWCETPO0TP8NL,5,These work fantastic. I have walked all through the house and have gotten the reception from the TV everywhere. This is a great purchase. I am going to buy a second pair for the living room so that I don't have to unplug and plug between TVs.
R1Y4N3LT9N9RPG,1,Cheap plastic base.  Cheap ear piece covers.  No charge light indication when headphones are fully charged.  These are three reasons why these headphones should MSRP for $49.99 and be sold on Amazon.com for $19.99.  Only then would the product match the price; I feel very duped.
R1KV81JDFBU984,5,"I reviewed a lot of wireless headsets before deciding on this one. It has great sound, very easy controls and no static. I can wear these outside and walk around my yard without any interference. I have them connected to my receiver which also has TV, DVD, stereo, etc. going through it. They work fantastic. I use them at night when my wife goes to bed or is reading and they not only sound great but they are comfortable to wear. I may wear them for 2-3 hours at a time and almost forget that I have them on. I would make the same order again if I needed another set. I may do it anyway since I know that I will wear them out at some point. If you are looking for great sound and comfort, look no more."
R1IQR8J5Y23T1N,5,"These are absolutely the best things I have done for myself in a long time. I am a political freak and I can wear these as I move about the house and never miss a thing. The sound is very surround-soundish, almost to a \\""show-off\\"" extent, which was a pleasant surprise. I cannot praise these enough. I like to watch late TV sometimes in bed and I NEVER have to worry about the volume bothering anybody. They are so comfortable I can wear them as long as I like with no discomfort. In fact, I have forgotten I have them on. I have also been careless with not always putting them in their charging cradle when not in use, but they always work.I don't know how long they can be used un-charged but it's not been a problem. I love them! I did find them through Amazon."
R36SNFGFLCRX5J,5,"Doing a excellent job, as advertised. Can't find any faults at this point. Items purchased on Amazon have been OK by me."
R2XRGBPD6THXG0,5,This product allows my nearly-deaf husband and me to be in the same room at the same time. He is happy with using these wireless headphones. He's happy; she's happy.
R2PSUZVPMZ9SF,4,"After wasting a lot of money, I decided to try once more with this brand.  I really didn't want to spend this much, but I was to the point of being too frustrated to even watch tv because I couldn't hear the dialogue.  FINALLY... I can hear most dialogue over the background music, and the reception is pretty clear.  It doesn't sound like a radio thats not quite on the station.  My only complaint is that every time I get up, bend over, etc., they fall off.  That can get quite aggravating at times.  They are definitely worth the money, I bought a second pair for the bedroom."
R2ANQEMRUKC48N,5,"I bought this headphone for my mother who is 79 years old and very hard of hearing.  She loves them.  The head phones recently broke, not sure why, but a bought another because it was such a huge quality of life product for her.  She cannot hear the TV with out them and she absolutely loves these.  She bought a pair for her brother as well and he also has been very happy with them. I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs help hearing and likes to watch TV."
R1GH5TWGMS7LFI,2,"+  It basically works. I plugged it into my Roku player so I can watch shows while my girlfriend studies.<br /><br />-  There is frequently interference, like a static hiss. This happens almost every time, regardless of the volume settings. It is not due to range...I sit about six feet from the transmitter. This huge negative overshadows any other issue, such as fit, price, or sound quality, none of which are stellar anyway."
R1QQTOW1Y2J67P,2,Sennheiser RS120  the transmitter was the problem. It was an automatic feature but it went on/off at inappropriate time. While listening it would go off and while charging it would go on. Sometimes it worked properly. I had to turn on the audio feature of my TV in order to channel the sound through the headphones. I even unplugged the connection and the green transmission light went on! I returned the product.  Ross Williams
R1TFRIKAYV30B3,4,hello headphones have great sound and good range but I miss my headphones I had to adapt the charger charger
R1IF5QJNLGQBNF,3,"I need this kind of headset when I watch a movie at night when my kids sleep.  I chose this one because of the brand name, Sennheiser.  This wireless headset is my first one. After that, I bought another USB wireless headset(Logitech Brand).  Installation is super easy.  This headset use RF channel and it means that the frequency can be used by another device or people.  When it works, it is good.  But sometimes when I watch a movie, I can listen another sound or noise. But not often.  Whenever I meet this problem, just wait or change frequency.    I bought two of it for me and my wife.  If you want to use two headset from one same source like TV, you don't need to install two of station.  Two headset shares one station.  When I tried it first, I installed two station and of course, it was not working."
R2FCOFA9VRL873,4,"They work better than expected. I've spent more on other brands, like Sony for example, but returned for excessive hissing, hit and miss reception as well as too expensive for a so-so product. The most notable critique is the fit. Though very comfortable when stationary...when walking around, they do slip when looking down or up. The sound is very good but even more impressive when you hold the pads slightly tighter to your ears. These would be a home run if the pads could be fitted tighter to the ear, the highs and low tones are even more impressive. Controls take some getting use to, no big deal though. Overall a very good wireless headphone at this price-point. Recommend."
R21YSBKJQTASSK,3,"When I tried these earphones in a motel in San Diego, I received an irritating hum on top of the received input. After I  got home and tried them in my own system, I can hear well -- except the exterior sound is mute when I wear them. Not good if there are two people trying to view a program."
R1RG9V87WADXFF,5,"I have, over the last 7 or 8 years had 4 infra-red wireless headphones and 3 RF Headphones. The infra-reds were OK but were not well constructed and soon gave up, i.e., bad off and on switch; quickly attracted dust to the volume control which became noisy; and, loose or broken wiring. They were reasonably cheap however.The other RF headphones had poor reception, were not comfortable and not worth the $$.  Not till I bought the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless RF Headphone did I finally get a the really good in all departments except for the placement of the volume and tune controls, but this is small potatoes. The sound is so much better than any of the earlier headphones the they were not even in the same galaxy as the Sennheiser. Comfort is great. A very impressive feature is the easy placement of the phones on the recharge stand. This is the first headphone that one does not have to fiddle with it to make it start charging. The cost of the phone is rather dear, but well worth the money."
R32HWBJZ5VW3D9,4,"I have no problem recommending this product to what it was created for. I would like to have had a more comfortable headphone fit, lean over and the headset falls off..... Other than that, they are great."
R3MTBSRXG3Y7IQ,1,"Bought this item in August. In March it died. Changed batteries, but still no go. Used them every nite. Will buy another-BUT NOT THIS BRAND."
R116X91JI85BDR,5,"I bought these headphones because of my mother. She lives with us and is quite hard of hearing. The TV was always blaring and it was stressing us all out.     They were a little more expensive that I originally wanted, but they are worth every penny. Now the TV can be muted and mom can watch TV and adjust the volume to her liking.    They were very easy to set up, even though the instructions that came with them were lousy (small and very hard to read).    The volume controls and tuning control are easy to adjust, although my mom hasn't quite mastered them yet.    I would definitely recommend these headphones."
R1M7GZUKKFAE9Y,5,"It works fine for me. I came to Amazon's website looking for a wireless headphones and this came up in my search and a few others. For some strange reason I settled on this one despite it being a little more expensive than others. I started reading the reviews before purchasing. Most were positive and some were very negative. I took both into consideration and thought to myself the problems people were talking about seem to be isolated. So I made the plunge. I am happy to say all is good so far. I used Amazon Prime, ordered it on Thursay and got it on Friday. It charges fine. I fell asleep with it on last night and it was still working fine when I got up. The volume is loud, which was the one thing I was worried about and from some of the reviews that gave me concern because if I had trouble hearing then I was sending it back. I am hearing impaired and can only hear from one ear so if the sound was too low then it wouldn't be worth it to keep it. But the volume is just fine. I haven't walked around my house to see the range I get yet, but that is not why I bought it. I just need it to listen to the tv late at night while my Aunt sleeps over in the next bedroom. I initally hooked it up to the Audio out ports but I didn't get anything when I did that. So I used the headphone adapter that was included and plugged it into my headphone port on the TV and used the Channels and tunning button and I got reception and everything is working fine. I recall someone writing a review saying that everytime they turn it off they have to retune to get reception again. Taht only happened to me once. When I turn it off I put it on the cradle but I don't let the metal connect. I let the headphones rest on the cushion while on the cradle. I leave the headphone adapter connected to the tv. Then when I want to use them. I plug the cradle back into the power outlet and move the headphones so it gets a momentary charge (meaning I let the metal touch the cradle) then I turn them on and Voila I don't have to retune it. Whatever is on the TV I immediately hear it. I would suggest that for those of you experiencing that problem. I have even suggested my mom get a pair.<br /><br />Edit 5/18/2011: I have been using it some time now and it does work wonderfully. I just went downstairs to the kitchen and I never lost the connection it was as loud as when I am in the same room as the receiver which was upstairs.I don't have to retune it.

R2935TTU4DBSD5,4,"I bought a similarly priced set of wireless headphones when my first child was born, to allow us to watch TV at a realistic volume and not wake up our little light sleeper.  They were problematic, hurt your ears so much that we needed to take a break while watching anything longer than a sitcom, static abounded, and eventually neither of us could stand them anymore.  After lots of research, I settled on this offering from Sennheiser, having decent reviews and being not terribly expensive.  Now 3 years later, I still love them just as much, and have had no issues at all.  Here are my observations, and also addressing some \\""cons\\"" listed by other reviewers:    1) Status/hissing noise. This seems to be a problem when the headphone volume is turned up high.  We were irritated with inconsistent static at first, until we discovered that if we turned our stereo/amp up to the max, the headphone volume doesn't need to be up very high at all, and have experienced no static or hissing noise under these circumstances.  Some static will also be present when the battery is running low, but as long as you keep them in the charging station when not in use, that really shouldn't be a problem.  2) Range seems pretty good.  I have even gone into the next room to my kitchen to wash dishes or make a snack during a commercial, and been able to listen the whole time without cutting out.  A trip to our garage for laundry, however, cuts in and out with some static.  3) Sound quality.  I am not an expert, but I'd rate these as being \\""very good\\"".  Not the same as our home stereo system, but I'd say on par with sound from your TV.  4) Design.  These phones are VERY comfortable.  I have a small head, and these adjust fine without falling off.  My husband has had friends over for gaming who have large noggins, and all say these are very comfortable, even after hours of wear.  They sit on your ears, and are not what I would call \\""sound-isolating\\"" headphones.  You can hear ambient noises, but I prefer that.  You could still hear a baby crying, and can detect when someone is trying to talk to you, though may not be able to hear the conversation until you remove the headphones.  If you truly want to be in your own world and not hear ANYTHING else, these are not the headphones for you.  5) Durability.  As I've said, we're past 3 years and still never had a problem.  We're not abusive or rough with them, but they've been sat on, dropped, etc, with no issues.  6) Charging station.  The charging unit is pretty big, and fits two headphones if you're careful.  I cannot believe the negative comments I've read about these being so difficult to charge.  There are grooves on the headphone so you know exactly where they are supposed to rest - it's not rocket science.  We have a second pair, and getting the 2nd headphone on correctly so that both charge takes SLIGHTLY more work, basically just making sure they are both touching, which often just involves pushing back slightly when you put the 2nd one on.  If you expect to just toss them on the charger as if you're playing horseshoes, then, yes, you will have problems.  But if you walk up to the charger and place them on, you'll be fine.      Ultimately, VERY pleased with these headphones.  Highly recommend!"
R35K90CALQ1DJI,3,"I read all of the reviews and bought these headphones.  I knew the Sennheiser name so felt I would be on the right track.  I have 3 pair of headphones.  A pair I bought at Radio Shack 5 years ago for $27 (bedroom), which died and is the reason for my purchase.  I also have the Sony headphones for $150 (TV room).  These cost $75 (bedroom).  My $27 headphones were the best in every way; sound, no problems, always worked.  Radio Shack no longer has the headphones.  When I first got the Senn headphones they worked 50% of the time and it was very frustrating.  We found out that when we had them plugged into the back of the TV (brand new LCD TV), that was the reason for them working only 50% of the time but when we plugged them into the back of our DVR, they work 100% of the time and we have had no more problems.  The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that they are not comfortable and fall of my head easily.  I didn't know they weren't the type that covers the whole ear.  The type that covers the whole ear are the most comfortable and the sound is better because your ear is encased.  Also they don't fall off.  When I'm sitting in bed watching TV with my head against a couple of pillows, it moves these headphones forward slightly off my ears and the sound is not as loud.  As for recommending these headphones, I would say get the headphones that cover the ear whatever brand."
R124YXU26LUEFR,4,"Unfortunately, the directions for setup are not explicit enough. You are not informed that the headphones do not work plugging into the output jacks with a VCR attached to the TV. Also, you cannot get audio reception on the VCR without a special hookup. Once connection is made, the headphones are clear and I am able to get reception throughout my house. Overall it serves my purposes."
R1QCPDLT0T0J3,2,"They do not increase  the sound level sufficiently. I would not recommend them to people with impaired hearing. They should be marked \\""not intended for hearing impaired.\\""    W.P. Van Horn  wpvanhorn@comcast.net"
R33I6SX1HIW76F,5,I bought these for my dad because he has trouble hearing. He keeps the t.v. up so loud! He loves these and it allows him to listen to the t.v. well so the rest of us won't go deaf!! He also loves that he can walk to get the mail and still listen to the t.v. =). I am happy with this purchase.
R3NXYPA24SCGR6,3,"Considering the price:  great sound, comfortable, awesome charging cradle. I'm satisfied spending $80  on this set. 1 huge drawback for me as you'll see in other posts here I'm sure...  awful LOUD static noise when signal is dropped. A few times already, working on computer listening to music, not noticing the 'silence' between songs (Pandora)... and WHAM!!! sharp static pierces my ears! Not physically harmful because I don't have volume very loud... but it's startling. Terrible design (are all wireless headphones like this?)"
R2IJKMHM2XR4CK,5,"I bought these so we could listen to the TV and music through headphones, which should give better sound quality than built-in TV speakers and provide an opportunity to enjoy sound without disturbing others. These Sennheisers fit that bill on both accounts. The sound quality is excellent and its easy to connect to the TV to listen only through the headphones or with the TV speakers on. The range of reception is great--over 100'--my wife can walk out and pick up the morning paper without losing the signal or good reception. They work very well while exercising. There is very little static on our setup, the battery life is 4+ hours and the recharging cradle is simple and easy to use. The headphones fit my head well, but will not fit a person with a very small head. I give these a strong recommendation and are the best of 3 sets of wireless headphones I've owned."
RLPCD90BYF9GY,1,My brother had an older model that is no longer available and I liked it for overall quality so I ordered this model thinking I would have the same equipment. The quality of this model was very disappointing. The headphones do not fit properly and if you move around they will fall off your head. The sound quality is not good. You cannot get the static out of the headphone sound even with constant tinkering with the tune control. The reception is poor when you move more than twenty feet from the transmitter. The unit does work if you don't mind the background static. I suggest not buying this model due to the cheap quality. I am disappointed in Sennheiser.
R3V6XM17B8H51X,4,"Bought this headset a couple of weeks ago for my father-in-law who is loosing his hearing.  These wireless headsets are great for sr. adults needing some help in hearing TV shows.  The concept is that the user can adjust his/her own volume (headset) without having to have the TV volume up as loud as it goes.  The benefits to this are obvious.  My father...age 93...has had a wireless headset for over 2 years now and couldn't watch TV without it!<br /><br />The ONE COMPLAINT I have with this headset (and, it may apply to other sets, too), is that the TV connection is ANALOG (RCA-type) plugs ONLY.  Now, on the surface, you might think this is OK.  However, have you actually looked on the back of your TV??  Yes, you may see the typical RED-WHITE ANALOG jacks, BUT do you know if they are for OUTPUT, or INPUT ONLY?  That's where I ran into problems.  My father-in-law has a new(er) 42\\"" LCD flat-panel TV with LOTS of jacks on the back.  BUT, upon investigation, I found that 95% of the jacks are for INPUT ONLY....and not a single ANALOG AUDIO OUTPUT in the bunch!  As a matter of fact, the only audio output is a DIGITAL (fiber) connection, intended for driving home-theater-style speaker systems.  Now, being the techno-whiz that I am, I figured that a DIGITAL-to-ANALOG audio 'adapter' might exist.  Sure enough, there is such a product BUT, the cost of the 2 or 3 that I found were more than the cost of the wireless headset...probably not a viable option.<br /><br />SOLUTION:  Remembering that my father-in-law had another (smaller) LCD TV in his bedroom, I thought he might be able to use the headsets when he was in bed.  Sure enough, this TV had the required ANALOG OUTPUT jacks and the headset connection plugged in and worked as expected.  Realizing that this headset was 'wireless', I then discovered how he could actually watch the big set in his living room AND use the headset, too.  He simply had to tune the smaller set (where the headset was connected) to the same channel he wanted to watch in the living room.  Yes, it's a little trouble to have to get up and go change the channel on the smaller set everytime you want to watch something different, BUT, it is the best (only) option to allow him to keep the headset.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  The headset is great, and functions in line with expectations.  As long as you have an ANALOG OUTPUT jack to plug in the headset connections, you'll get satisfactory results from them...at least, for this type of requirement.to watch in the living room.

R4RVFIH0QC5EQ,4,"This is a very good buy if you wish to hear voice and you are hard of hearing. It is also useful in allowing you to move about, even go to a second floor room and still hear your program. Its only downside is a bit of stiffness in the mount. But of course head shape is a variable. It is not a device for those who listen to music in a serious way. Even the millions who can live with MP3 might find it a bit hard and bass-insufficient."
R1BSPYQRZMCZU4,1,I bought these intending to use with my television.  However - I hear nothing but static and can't get anything resembling a clear signal on any of the available receiver channels.    I assume that part of the issue of lack of reception is due to the wireless internet router we use in our house - perhaps the signals are crossing.  I highly advise against these headphones for television use if you live in the modern world and have or plan to have any other wireless devices.
R3NLNNIC4IGX2C,3,"I have had this wireless head set for about a year. I use it primarily for my TV in the bedroom. My wife sometimes does not want to listen to the TV when I am watching football or baseball.  The greatest problem I have, and to me it is a deal killer, is that when you have your head on a pillow and roll to one side where the controls are located you will almost always move the volume control either up or down.  This problem does not occur anywhere but the place I primarily use it.<br /><br />Comparing this wireless headset with the Seinheiser RS-180 I find there is no comparison.  The RS-180 is far superior in comfort, reception, and it has recessed controls so there is no problem with accidentally moving the volume control up or down. Cost of the RS-180 is higher but to me the difference in cost is worth it. I rate the RS-180 5 stars. If you can afford it then buy it. It sure is not inexpensive."
R1M3CP4ZUAB9EV,4,"After a disappointing experience with another wireless headset, this was a great buy. I'd paid the same price for an infrared headset that cut out when someone walked in front of the tv or I walked out of the line of sight. This headset offers great clarity, ease of charging, and there is no interference when I use it to watch television while using the treadmill. The Sennheiser name was a big selling point, and I wasn't disappointed. I only wish I'd saved the money I spent on the other purchase so I could buy two of these! The only complaint is that the volume control is on the same side as the tuning wheel and you have to be careful to adjust the right one. Otherwise, I love this headset!"
R3R9P3KIF4EUBP,5,"I am new to wireless headphone options.  I really like these, especailly the light weightedness and  the sound quality. I do not get the range I thought I would, but, I can live with that...probably has to do with where I live.    Good price, too."
R3GB0LDG471YLT,5,"Have found these headphones to be exactly what is needed for my hearing problems.  They are comfortable, the controls are easy and they pick up the sound all over the house.  My only problem with them is they fall off my head when I bend over, but they have survived numerous falls and still work fine."
R1QCA83AOBQC0,2,I was unable to get them to work.  I carefully followed the instructions for connecting them but I never got anything but static from them.
R21R5F70DO29A5,5,"I have been having problems hearing the dialogue on TV shows and movies for some time. With these headphones I'm not distracted by the background noise or music. I can hear the voices clearly and don't have to ask my wife, \\"" What did they say?\\""  It's a marriage saver ! ! !"
R3I9M7R1ZZADIN,5,"I had tried many different brands of wireless headphone including most of the models carried at Radio Shack and Best Buy and returned them all to the store.  I knew nothing about Sennheiser until i ran across them on Amazon and took a chance.  I am very pleased with these headphones.  Sound Quality, Comfort, Battery Life and Range are all superior."
RGG7X5IN1JBE7,1,"This is my first ever review after a decade w/ Amazn, so I am needless to say *very* disappointed. I just need to second++ the previous complaints about needing to have the TV volume up. I am not an over the top audiophile, I just want something passable. When I read the reviews saying that the volume needed to be turned up, I had not imagined that the problem would be so dramatic; if my tv volume is not full 100%, the WAH-WAH-SCRATCH is unbearably bad. At that volume, if I ever unplug the headphone jack w/o turning the volume down I will probably blow my speakers. This is simply unacceptable, and I am returning them.    That said, there may be hope for some of you; if your tv has a \\""line out\\"" (for going to a computer or sound system) instead of a just headphone out, it *may* work OK there. My guess is that the people who are happy with the unit have a situation like this. Sadly I don't, I only have digital optical out (too high end) and headphone jack (too low tech)."
R3PDYJK3FZOC4F,5,My wife has a problem hearing spoken voices on TV and she loves these. She tells me they fit well and are very comfortable.
R3U50M242LKQG2,5,"I bought these headphones so my husband could watch TV without disturbing me while I read.  We both love them! The reception is great - he can walk outside or upstairs and still get perfect reception. They also act really well as noise canceling headphones, or so he says, because he can't hear a word I say to him while he has them on. The charging cradle is sleek and low profile and fits easily behind the TV.  Sennheiser has been a leader in electronics for many years and they didn't let us down."
RT4CDKTXRN3BJ,5,"We owned an earlier headset by Sennheiser & this is a vast improvement.  No constantly having to change the battery.  Just hang it up, it recharges itself & the charge lasts indefinitely.  We love it."
R1SUR3USDDCI37,5,"I bought this wireless earphone set to replace a similar Sennheiser TR140 that I broke by sitting on it. This unit pleases me even more because it has a greater range than the old one, doesn't lose sound anywhere in my two-story, 2000 ft home"
R2OTIAJ66F9BE7,4,"I love these head phones because they were inexpensive brand name wireless head phones. I love that I can watch TV at night now without waking up my better half when things are exploding or people are screaming in agony - I watch a lot of horror films. For the price and the quality here I cannot complain much.    I only have a few things I am not too hot about:    1. There is a very slight static in the background almost always, but this really depends on how much interference you have around you. Since this set operates on a Frequency that other devices operate on, it is more than possible that you will pick up unwanted signals, but hey that is why they are tunable... just change the channel. It comes with the territory when you go wireless.    2. Depending on the shape of your ears, these head phones are the \\""on the ear\\"" type as opposed to \\""over the ear\\"" type. I always prefer the less invasive over the ear type. I didn't realize that until I got them, so after about an hour, my ears hurt, but that is because my ears kinda stick out. Either way no big deal, I just re-adjust the set every hour which is something you will probably do anyhow, ie: Go to the bathroom, take a phone call, get grub from the kitchen etc...    3. When using this device, MAKE SURE the green light on the base is ON other wise if you have the head phones on and they are switched on, if the base doesn't detect any audio for a period of 5 minutes or so; get ready for a scare because you will hear the loudest white noise on the earth. Scared the crap out of me the first time it happened. I was selecting a movie from my Netflix queue (hence the lack of audio) and BOOM white noise. I thought I broke the damn thing.    Overall great buy."
R1S3EI77FTAABE,3,"We have purchased two sets of these headphones, both for relatives who have trouble hearing the television.  The first pair has been in frequent use for over two years and still works well (and it is GREAT not to constantly have to answer the question, \\""What did he say?\\"" while watching TV).  The second set was purchased for a relative whom we subsequently discovered did not have a compatible TV (not sure why, as it is a relatively new set), so it has stayed at our house and has had infrequent use when our hard of hearing guests are here (or occasionally for late night TV watching, which is also nice).  This second set has now malfunctioned twice; the charger simply stops working, has no power.  A week or so later, it has started working again.  Review of the warranty policy indicates we would have to pay for shipping if we wanted even a shot at getting it repaired/replaced, and given the moderate price of the headphones, I don't think it's likely worth it."
R2IFV1Z1I0OWN7,4,"I have been using this for the past 3+ months. I bought this to watch TV quietly. Everything works great except loosing signal at times. Doesn't happen very often. When it happens, I will just reset the frequency.    There are much better products in the market. But if you are looking for an economical options, this is the one to GO.    Hope this helps.    Mathew."
R2F2UHQ175QGUP,4,"The headphones are just fine.  Unfortunately, I thought I could wear them when my husband and I watched TV together.  However, when the headphones are plugged in, no sound comes from the TV.  So he wears them when he wants to watch TV and I don't.  And, frequently, I still can't hear the audio well."
R3915IC9Q0IPXP,5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, just wished it had a little more bass, but the sound clarity is awesome.  Easily charged, and use it everywhere in the home.  I was even able to go outside with doors shut and still hear my music coming from my computer.  Very happy with my purchase!"
R3HVYXR4K6VQFA,5,"I researched several units before I settled on this one. [ Sennheiser RS 120 926 ] I am well pleased with it. So much so I convinced my Brother to purchase one for his wife and himself. I also got our Church to invest in one for the folks with hearing problems.  You can operate more headsets with this ynit and get up to 300 ft range. For use with  TV or Sound system, I recommend it."
RSLNGYIFMC11B,5,"The last wireless headphones I owned picked up the flourescent lights and the refrigerator cycling on and off. With this unit all I get is what it's plugged into--period. My husband turns in early but I am a night owl. Now I can watch as late as I want and not bother him. Additionally, since my husband is partially deaf he can enjoy watching his shows without blasting the rest of us out of the room.    I'm writing this 8 months after purchase and there haven't been any problems."
R2FGAEZ4W0GXDL,5,"This product works perfectly.  Both my husband and I have one. We each can adjust our sound separately.  Gosh, the volume to the t.v. can be off and one person can be watching a program and not disturb the rest of the household.  The sound is excellent and there is just no problem at all.  Well-------------it is difficult to \\""hear each other\\"" when we comment on what's on----------but maybe that's good, too!!?"
R2BVVI3D6UBWS1,1,"This unit only worked twice, the problem is constantly charging a rechargeable battery (chinese) and the battery leaked, ruining the device."
RE9E3SZQSM6YK,4,"This is a great product.  It is cheap, and works very well.  I read a lot of the reviews, but skeptically bought it for office use.  I was tremendously disappointed that the product I received is not the one that is posted.  The one I received (as many reviewers have pointed out) does not have a charging cradle.  That is profoundly annoying and absurd.  Still, if you follow the directions and try to place the stand as far away from wires or electronics as possible, the reception is PERFECT.  For people getting a hiss, they must be experiencing problems with fine motor control.  It takes ~30 seconds to get the reception dial perfect, but after that, the sound is great.  For the price, it is great in every way.  Just prepare to be annoyed that the product you receive is NOT the one with a charging cradle.  I was so angry that I thought about returning it, but it works so well that it is not worth the trouble."
R1IFAXGJHYCAHO,1,"Constant static and buzzing during playback, an auto turn-off feature that blasts static into your ears if the volume source is silent for a minute, awkward physical design where the headphone have actually just fallen off my head from slight movement, a charger that fails to charge unless the headphones are placed just so... And then they just completely stopped working in less then two months...  The combination of terrible design and awful execution is truly stunning. Easily the worst electronic device of any kind I've ever bought. I didn't know it was possible for a pair of headphones to be as bad as these."
R2IK2UN6SX1T54,5,We love them.  This distance factor is great  even from the bed room they work  so he can put the tv on in there(volumn low) and hear it through the headphones from the den
R24GBUP5PTHRQC,5,"The Sennheiser headset greatly increased my enjoyment in watching TV. At last, I can hear the dialogue clearly and the background sounds stay in the background and don't obliterate the main focus, the dialogue. I hear background whispers and subtle sounds as they naturally should be and not competing with the conversations between the main characters. If I have to go to another room while watching the news, I can still listening to it all over the house. Also, when my wife is reading, I can mute the TV and still hear through my headset which she greatly appreciates. When we both watch TV together, I can hear clearly without blasting her out of the room! The charging cradle is a must! It's always ready for me to use. The price was very reasonable and I had plenty of options to select from. The only annoyance I have with it is that if I bend over, it tends to fall off my head. But the enjoyment I receive greatly out weighs the inconvenience!"
R351NVHXU0MFB2,4,"The unit arrived as advertised. It may not suit an audiophile, but I use it for TV and it is great for that purpose. The fit is a bit loose and if you shake your head the unit will slip off. A problem I solved was that the batteries have to be firmly inserted so they do not slip out of position, otherwise the sound will not be good. Once I figured that out there has been no problems.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
RFTYROQCH4HX8,4,I decided to purchase Sennheiser wireless headphones RS120 because of reviews that I read. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I have full confidence in the product and know that I will have many years of reliable use.
R2EVQ8UGTPJ25A,1,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORSE SET I HAVE EVER PURCHASED THE QUALITY IS CRAP,ONE I GET UP FROM THE COUCH I LOSE SOUND WHILE YOU ARE SITTING THEY ARE NOT TO BAD,I ORG HAS THE SAME MODEL BUT THE TR 140 HAD THEM 6 YEARS AND EVENTUALLY THE PLASTIC ON ONE SIDE BROKE THE HEADPHONES STILL WORK THE QUALITY WAS GREAT I COULD GO OUT SIDE AND STILL HEAR MY MOVIE THE NEWER ONE ARE JUST PLAIN CRAPPY HAVE SENT THEM BACK ONCE ALREADY AND STILL NO JOY"
R2FHQPE9FMZF5T,5,"Love it. Good quality, fit, comfort. Sounds great watching TV, playing games, listening to music. Just love it, something I wanted for a long time. Definitely recommended."
R1YDTNA4IVFWDA,4,"They do the job for me. The only drawback would be when you pause tv, you usually get an earful of static in just a few moments.  Do really like them!"
R85RNFEQH2DCW,5,"Freedom to watch at any time without disturbing people around you.  We used these at home (have two, plus a charger, and alternate or even charge both at once - needs a bit of acrobatice setup but can be made to work).  They're phenomenal and well worth the price tag.  The sound almost feels ambient to the point where sometimes I don't know if I'm on headphones or TV set until I take off the headphones and hear silence (well, small noise from the headphones, but not the TV).  Unlike earbuds, they're not going to damage your ears, since you don't need them too loud to hear well (esp. if the point is not to drown out outside noise but to remain silent for the kids sleeping in the next room).   And the range is good, albeit not infinite: if we go through the bedroom (adjacent to the living room) and bathroom and close the door, we get only half the signal.  Still, that's all we need in this city apartment: we can make a cup of tea in the kitchen and keep listening to our program (nice if someone else is watching and doesn't want to pause).    With out setup, our two kids sometimes prefer to watch their programs with the headphones because they hear better without the noise from us, the grownups.  And we're quite happy to have our peace and quiet at the dinner table, too.    This is easily our best home improvement purchase of this shopping season.  I highly recommend this item to any couple with children in city apartments."
R1V9XPB5KJ8T2E,2,"I have had 3 or 4 pairs of wireless headphones in my life so I think that fact counts as important.     I've been using a wireless pair of SONY MDR-RF970RK for television only. The SONY are excellent and are \\""over Ear\\"" type. But they had an unusual battery charging system (induction)and when the special batteries that came with the SONY set wore out, I tried to buy new ones but I made a mistake with my address and the batteries went to the wrong address and it looked like I was never going to get them.    So, being irritable about the battery problem and not knowing it was my mistake, I decided to get these Sennheiser RS120. They came just a few days ago and I just sent them right back; returned them. They are fairly well made in the general sense and the sound was fine; my TV is a new HD flat panel 40\\"" SONY BRAVIA. BUT, BUT, BUT!!!     These Sennheiser do not cover the ears and are too loose. I mean they do not cup the ears, just fit \\""on\\"" the ears.So you lose sound escaping at the ears and my ears became sore from the direct contact with the ears. Also, because they do not cup the ears, and perhaps because of other poor design (maybe weak spring system tension)they shift on your head with the slightest movement of your body or head. With the SONY, I could move around the house, do kitchen stuff, etc., or other little jobs while listening to news, etc. and the phone would not fall off my head.     So I thought I would just go back to using the SONY and would go with regular rechargeable batteries which as I said you can't recharge on the phone cradle in the SONY because it's only for induction type batteries.That's a bit of a nuisance but better than the negatives I just described for the Sennheiser we are discussing. But I finally did get the batteries (my mistake)for(Batteryclerk.com). But you can use AAA regular batteries if you have to and replace them regularly or use rechargeable as I said.    I bought the SONY pair which are excellent, May of 2008 for $100.00and you can buy them here on Amazon. As I said, you can buy the unusual battery for those now if the original one \\""burns\\"" out as mine did in 3 year.You can also buy a Sennheiser pair here which cup the ears but I don't think they are on a chargeable base and have not seen them personally; check those out.      Bottom line: Buy the SONY pair I recommended above if can spend that much and want a good fitting, wireless, rechargeable pair. You can alway go to a store to buy phones to try them on for comfort. And ask about the battery type. Radio Frequency is best for me; it's a strong signal and you can walk around your house, garage, driveway, etc., and still get the signal.    Good luck. The Amazon buying and shipping and returning process is excellent but I just can't recommend the pair these Sennheiser headphones."
R2K83BB5GACT6W,5,"OK, all you older folks that can't hear well. This is the answer to your prayers. Makes watching videos a pleasure. Great stereo sound. Quite dynamic. Can't say enough. These work flawless. Top quality."
R39BIU7FPANB87,4,"It was a bit of a hassle connecting to an old TV that didn't have a monitor port.  Connecting to our newer TV was a snap.  Only downside:  I didn't realize the RS-20 only had open foam ear pieces.  I have another Sennheiser model that has the full ear pieces, fully enclosing the ear.  They do a much better job of filtering out background noise.  But all in all, a great value."
R1O4NGLMDVXS6Y,4,"really nice for the price. Great value. I bought it so my Girlfriend could sleep in a little on the weekends while I had the music or tv at the volumes I enjoy. They sound so good that I've been using them when she's awake. We live in a condo so if we're watching tv's in different rooms, one of us can use the headphones so we don't have dueling tv's anymore."
R2U68HH68CUXBC,5,"I have only had the headphones for about 5 days but so far I'm amazed that they work so well. The sound quality is really great. Yesterday I put the headphones on,turned the TV on and went into my bedroom and layed down. The TV was set to a music station and there was no decrease in the quality of sound.  One thing that I found out last night was that I can select a station on my TV and then turn the Tv off and still listen to the channel that was on when it's off.   To sum things up-the price was good,shipping was ok,packageing was fine,and the headphones are amazing! I just wish that I would have bought them months ago."
R3G5WC33U7IHON,4,"These are wonderful headphones.  The sound is very clear and good volume.  They fit well, too.  The cradle for them has a nice look to it.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the tuning button is located so that I occasionally bump it while leaning in my high back chair and it moves."
R1M66JJTRW4XVR,5,Good clear sound quality. Wife is hearing impaired and she can listen to TV without the tv sound volume turned up to max. Mute the tv sound and you can listen with the headphones. You can move about the house or outside and hear the tv. Pleased with my Sennheiser 120 headphones.
R20HZFTB4KJXM7,4,"I bought these for my father in law.  I had purchased two  wireless head sets similar to these from Costco.  The the batter life on those were short, and the sound kept breaking up.  The Sennheiser's work much better. The rechargeable batteries are great.  Sound quality very good, and the range from the base is great too.  I would recommend them.  My father in law loves them!"
R154KIKB594P5F,5,"My wife and I have tried a couple others headphones and that really helped us see just how good these Sennheisers are.  We've had headphones that sounded great but the cord was a pain.  The last pair we had from CostCo were great for hearing people talk, but sucked for anything but News.  With these Sennheiser's you get a full range of sound and quickly forget your wearing them and sink into the movie.    CON: The only down side on these is the comfort level while wearing glasses during a long movie.  The cups don't swivel and the pressure of the cups can't be adjusted.      PRO: Great sound, rechargeable on the base, great value!"
R31P4T7W96TVQ9,5,"Sennheiser RS120. This is the 3rd unit I bought  because they really work. You can watch TV anywhere in the house without disturbing anyone else. The other advantage is that they also drown out any ambient noise like someone talking on the phone or exterior noise. The cordless feature make them very flexible to use. For example, I like to use them on the exercise machine and it is nice not to have a cord plugged into the TV in front of you. Recharging works like a charm. They easily charge overnight, and never seem to run out of power when you use them. The fit is comfortable and light enough not to start bothering you with prolonged usage. They are built with care and use good materials, I still use the 1st set I bought some 5 years ago and they show no wear & tear. I can highly recommend them as a great way to enjoy listening to music or watching TV without disturbing anyone else in your household. SailerNick"
RQ51HUJY6G58M,1,"Horrible hissing sound.Range no more than 6 feet directly in front of sending unit. Any appliance/light turned on in house caused loud crackling noise as did turning head. Returned as faulty for I can't imagine these being sold working like this. Tried everything instruction sheet said to no avail. My equipment is good quality,Pioneer/Bose and works great. Back to my old Sony headphones wire and all.Wish these had worked for the freedom of movement."
R1WSEP8FPJTROW,3,"The headphones worked great for the 1st week.  Then the left ear went weak despite tuning and trying different transmit-channels, but it came back.  The tuning is too sensitive and becomes hit & miss.  This is a shame because when it works, the sound is great.  In all honesty it may be just this one unit...the next one may work fine."
R1X0W2DJZGUUAM,5,"I purchased this headphone set for my father-in-law at his request and had it shipped to my house out of state.  I tried to install it and got nothing but static on my four TV'S.  Installation seemed simple and I couldn't believe it was my fault so I called the 1-800 number for help.  The guy told me it was probably my TV wasn't able to convert the signal to the proper wavelengths.  He offered to allow me to return it.  This made me think he knew of manufacturing problems but I waited until my son-in-law came to visit and he got it working by going to the my TV remote and playing with the set-up and turned on the audio output which had been off.  The headset worked fine at my house.  Luckily, when it took it to my father-in-laws,his sets didn't need to be properly set up and it worked just fine.  He is happy as a clam with it.  I think the customer service 1-800 guy needs to be properly trained."
R55VQN7DBB7AQ,5,"This is not one of those technical reviews where I've researched dozens of wireless sets and this one is the best. I've only tried this one, and was given it as a gift from my son, so there may be better options. I had been using my old Sony wired headset for years because I thought they were top of the line.  Behold, when I tired these I was amazed at the sound quality -- and I am fussy.  Excellent bass, very natural sound overall. Without phones I have trouble understanding TV dialogue, but when I use these I don't use subtitles, even when there is background music.  The wireless aspect is great -- I can get up and make coffee, etc., without being tethered to the set. The charger sits in back of my TV out of sight. They are so comfortable I forget I have them on.  My only regret is that I haven't had these earlier. Very well worth the price.  As I say, there may be better options, but I am a happy TV watcher."
R1FRO9HIA4Z1I6,5,"Bought these headphones about two years ago and since then have used them at least a few hours every single day.  Never replaced batteries, just hang em up overnight when you go to sleep and they're good to go for many hours the next day.  In the 2 years I've had them, it's literally ran out of power maybe 3 or 4 times; largely due to my negligence in hanging it on its cradle over several days.    The wireless signal carries well,  can get a decent signal 100ft or more away through multiple walls.  Excellent for attaching to computer/tv/stereo or whatever at night when others are asleep.  You can even amble out to the kitchen to fix a midnight snack and never miss a beat of whatever it is you're listening to.    Money WELL spent."
R2VAXT0XP7VDI5,4,"Purchased on Amazon from Electronics Expo about 2 weeks ago for my wife, who is hard-of-hearing and has Parkinson's disease. At first she was reluctant to try the headphones. Then, when she did, they were \\""too heavy and slightly uncomfortable.\\"" When she learned they were only about 8 oz. she warmed up to them, and now she wears them when watching TV all the time. It took a day or two to coordinate the TV and headphone volume levels to be comfortable for other people in the room and for my wife. We live in a 4 level home, with the \\""main\\"" TV in the family room at the lowest level. The headphones deliver good sound quality throughout the house at all levels. There is an occasional hiss when passing close to walls having electrical cabling, but this was not unexpected, and is just an instantaneous event when moving around the house. The price was very good, delivery within 3 business days. Set-up was very simple...virtual \\""plug & play.\\"" We forget to park the headphones on the charger, but the batteries have shown no signs of weakness when left uncharged for days. Controls are simple, and operate quite well: on/off...tuner...volume. Recommended!"
R28VRKSLQBWDF7,1,"Does not work, Amazon not available to help exchange, emailed company to help on tech support and not a call or email on support. Wanted to return but Amazon nor Sennheiser replied with the how to's    On my TV it DOES NOT WORK"
R2Q98JTBHAK8WA,5,"I ordered these and got them pretty quick. didn't use them for awhile, but when I did they are great. Only quibble is with the sweaty ears, but I guess that'll be the case with all such items as it is my ears that sweat with any earphones, which is why I normally wear earbuds, but all in all these were a great buy."
R3I0NTZQW0U1SU,2,I can never adjust the channel perfectly to not hear static on these.  Static noise render this unit useless.  I rarely use it.  I regret this purchase and would return it if I hadn't thrown away the packaging.
R1KOIBOFTNR8Y4,5,Our first set was given to my husband for Christmas a couple of years ago as his hearing isn't that great.  The Sennheiser is great and recommended highly.  We have since purchased a second one for the TV in the bedroom.
R2F6Q9Z9EX4JHP,5,"The fidelity is the best feature of these headphones. The only thing I can think of that could improve would be the controls. They are quite small and although they don't have to be tweaked very often, it would be better if they were a little larger, especially the volume control.    This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enhanced listening experience."
RSOAI9Z6G47ZJ,4,Good product but could have more comfortable ear cups. The cups are flat and press on the ears. Over all I like them very much. It is nice because I can mute the TV and use the head set so my wife can read while I watch TV.
RO50JYK96A6NU,2,"I was unable to get the system to work with my TV. It did work with my CD player, but only for a very short time, then it shut down. There has to be a problem with the transmitter. I returned the system. I am hoping the next one I get will work as it should. I know it is a good system, as a friend has one."
R1KJO93OW1F107,5,"I first learned of these headphones from our daughter and son-in-law when we were visiting them.  My husband needs to have the television volume turned up to a level that is uncomfortable for the rest of us.  When he used the headphones, we could listen to a normal volume, yet he could also hear clearly.  I immediately ordered a set when we returned home.  When I received the headphones I did have a difficult time figuring out where to connect them until I realized I needed to connect them to the cable box.  Problem solved and happiness ensued!"
R2AM1TIE9R8UGV,3,"The headphones work well enough, but for the price I'd say they don't live up to their billing.  Regardless of channel or tuning adjustment a constant crackle and hum is constant.  I tested this with both a computer and my television.  Turn the volume up loud enough and the interference is not so annoying.  I would not buy these again for the price."
R2IHRCMRRVVZOY,4,"Bought this item a few months ago because I tend to stay up late and my partner is finishing her dissertation and needs quiet sometimes.     It's worked great! There were a number of mixed reviews, so I was unsure. I've been happily surprised by how well it's worked - so much so I felt compelled to write this review (first ever).     If you're looking for wireless headphones that will allow you to listen to TV, music, or the radio without disturbing someone, these will do the job nicely."
R3MP18XB18C9N1,5,"I recently upgraded my headphones from a Sony set, and I am very happy with Sennheiser. They have excellent sound quality, and I can walk almost anywhere in my house and still receive good audio. I did not experience any hiss that I read on other reviews. The controls are simple, and the unit lightweight and comfortable. Also, I got a great price on Amazon, about half the price of the big electronic stores."
R376RK06JM1IT3,4,"I have found these headphone to work very well, the controls are easy to use. Due to the size they are bulky on the head and tend to fall off if you bend over. The reception and sound quality is good. Would recommend to a friend."
R341KFQ8WACHWH,2,"This worked pretty well when used about a foot from my computer, but when I use it with the TV, about 8ft away, the reception is awful. We have tried rescanning many times and no change. Constant whirring sound and hiss. Unusable."
R2RMQBSK7QKCRW,5,"Excellent wireless headphones.  Quality & comfort is outstanding.  At home, I used to use my iPOD almost exclusively to listen to music.  Now I almost exclusively listen to all my music from my home PC using the Sennheiser RS120 via the RCA audio adapter that came with the unit.  Plugs right into the audio out jack that comes standard on most PCs."
R6R89JYUQ9FG4,3,"Not able to review, the Sennheiser RS12 is not capable of being connected to a Sony Bravia Home theater surround system. It can only connect via RCA connection."
R1UV1MCDO8OHEV,4,"Read about and compared online various wireless mikes, tried a Sony and Acoustic Research and returned both. The Sony I bought (even though not top-of-the-line), I expected decent service for $70.00. Since it was an infrared signal, my hands, my dog, even my feet obstructed the path of signal... forget range. The AR was somewhat more decent, sound was good, bass and overall sound was clear, range was the problem. On the other hand, Sennheiser RS120  (again not top of the line ) but what an astounding difference...Plenty of bass, I have the charger/transmiter mounted behind my TV and still no interference in the transmission. I can go upstairs, closed doors and still the sound is excellent. I experienced a slight hiss once and got it corrected with the tuning button and volume combination. I can only imagine what the $300+ units will do. For me this is the end of my search. The only drawbacks on this unit and what prevented me from giving it a all-around five star was the fact that it slips off my head if I bend down to pick up anything, the headset is too bulky and the charger is a little too tall. The design of the charging rods could've been somewhat shorter, more compact and the overhead band also. Other than that, this is a supperb unit for the buck. Buy one to experience the best."
RNA0CBAILDCRK,3,The headphones are a great valve my only issue is the hissing sound it has sometimes other than that thay are a great buy I even bought a second one for my wife to use if you have kids this is a must have overall this is a great buy thanks
R2GLDTESY9LQDE,5,"the best electronic accessory purchased.  Wife's x-mas gift.  She stays up lat at night watching TV and I can sleep soundly without any noise.  I've tried them and the sound is incredible!  Very, very satisfied with purchase."
R1I1OEHUZ4BV2U,4,"I went to a big electronics store and was told that I would find nothing under their $80 headphones, found these for under $50 and plugged them in, and they work great. I don't plan to use these for listening to high quality music, just radio talk shows on the internet, but for me they are great. They work outside, and on the second level of the house, which is just what I wanted."
RR00ZL7VZ7RAB,4,"I bought these and a pair of TV Ears at the same time. I have since bought a second Sennheiser headset and we NEVER use the ears.    Incredible range through multiple walls. Very nice to be able to walk anywhere in the house or garage and not lose reception.  Can monitor TV like a quality radio, and come back and rewind DVR to anything you really need to see. Comfortable and very little static. I never even thought of the value of having the long range reception until I got these. For me, I'd rate these 8 of 10, (TV Ears 3 of 10). I suspect some of the Sennheiser more expensive models are probably even better if budget permits.  In some TV shows we used to turn on captions because it was difficult to pick up certain things. The clarity of these makes that completely unnecessary.    My only complaint is that the rechargeable batteries require you to get out of bed and walk over to the set to put them on recharge and then sometimes they don't contact properly and poorly recharge. Too bad they don't have a low voltage wired transformer that you could plug into AC next to the bed to plug into a head set for recharging or extending a dead battery condition or charging a second headset (2 don't fit well on one cradle). There have been several times That I changed out the rechargeables for AA's to extend, but battery swaps during a show are a PITA.    Good product though."
RH0G4T4MAI0SH,5,Generally an excellent product. It would be even better if it had a tighter grip so it did not fall off when moving around!
RDJH4VMLAWCB3,4,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my Dad. This is technically his review. Long story short, he gives it a thumbs up. The clarity and range are good. The set up was easy. The only detractor is that after a while the headsets squish his ears. Perhaps he's a bit spoiled because he spends a lot of time in his airplane wearing an exceptional set of Bose headphones but he feels that after an hour or so the Sennheisers need to come off for a few minutes. Other than that he's very happy with them."
R3SKJLZHUH4282,5,"I am moderate to severley hearing impaired.  I did a lot of research on wireless headphones and came to a conclusion that Sennheiser is the benchmark everyone uses.<br /><br />I made note of the good and bad and then made my purchase: RS120.<br /><br />In my situation the problems that others have noted are real - but hardly a show stopper.  As an example, much is said about the device producing static.  By simply adjusting the tuning control fixed this.<br /><br />The problem that the device 'times out' when an audio signal is not received is another - no problemo!  Once the audio source is comes back on - the sound is as perfect as it was.<br /><br />Overall, the RS120 appears to be a perfect match for my home - and somewhat of a marriage saver."
R2FD2KJNFZEFK4,4,The Senneiser wireless headpones are well worth the money but it's a good thing they have pictures because the instructions leave a lot to be desired...
R1HPRYSI2S9SA2,4,"The Sennheiser RS120 headphones are simply great...i like it a lot ! .. i use it on the treadmill and it works well.....I would not run with it though, it is also not very comfortable when doing yard work...it falls off easily.  Bottom line : great quality, could use some ergonomics to increase user comfort !"
R1AF2YAFSGPN8Q,1,"They aren't worth the money.  Be very careful when buying as after paying to ship it back and being charged a $15 restocking fee, I was out $35."
R1FDP5ZA06BDB4,3,"PROs:<br />- comfortable to wear<br />- good sound quality for a product of it's type<br />- Good battery life and ease of charging<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Doesn't hug my head very well, can easily fall off when I bow my head down to a 90' angle, maybe this product is not made for Asians who have smaller build.<br />- After a few months of usage, start losing sound on the right ear. have to adjust the volume up and down until the sound comes back. Quality issue I guess."
R2ULM4RUG5YT3I,4,A very nice product a little spendy but it is saving my ears.  I do not have to shout over the tv anymore.  Also a good range on far they can go before you lose signal.  Overal a good buy would be exelent if could get for a cheaper price.
RIP2YG3VFVNNS,4,"Purchased these for father with hearing aides who kept everyone up watching late TV. That problem solved! Dad loves them and the house is quiet.  The controls are confusing with a tuning knob next to and same as the volume control.  Have had to tape over the tuning knob, as Dad could not adjust the volume with out reseting the tuner -- then because of his hearing loss, someone else had to reset the tuner for him.  Also, the batteries that were supplied were the absolute cheapest rechargables on the market, 600ma.  Didn't want to hold a charge past 4 hrs.  Have replaced them with 1200ma batteries ($5) that last as long as Dad wants to wear them.  Recharging cradle is brilliant."
R1KLBEPTJWCS7S,5,"Truly a great product! Easy and comfortable to use, astounding range, good sound quality, Packed and shipped by someone who seemed to care. Try em you will like em!"
RA3IPBKSVB66E,5,"This is the best Christmas gift I have ever bought for my husband.  The loudness of our TV was becoming just too much for me.  After much research, I purchased these earphones for him and have been totally pleased.  He loves them and I love the quietness in our home.  He says the sound is great and he loves the fact that he can walk from one room to the next while wearing them.  His only complaint is that he says they can become a little warm on the head after wearing them awhile.  The fit is comfortable and he is a fairly large man. The original setup was simple and he keeps them on the charger when not in use.  Overall, we have been very pleased with this purchase."
R1J3YPMWPLD3DY,5,Now my family can enjoy a program withiout the tv blaring---(hubby is hard of hearing).  Wish I would have bought it years ago!!
R1ST6CY650ZX0R,5,Great product - this is my 3rd set - they seem to die after 5 years.  Still worth the cost. My wife enjoys tv at her volume and I can make it as loud as I want.
R3GOB6A3460J73,4,Bought these for my 85 year old dad.  Wears hearing aids but still cannot hear the tv.  He absolutely loves theses headphones and my mom loves the peace and quiet.  Could use better instructions in the package.  Almost missed the power hook up because it was tucked behind the packing materials.
R3JF585KKFM69E,5,"i bought these to replace my old acoustic research  headphones. excellent buy for the money. all pros and  only one con . i wish they had more cushion for the ears. i would buy again . excellent reception , ease of charging and hook up. buy these you wont be dissapointed!!!!!!!!1"
RE6Y7P3PSSP51,5,Love the headphones.  My husband puts them on and can walk around the home and still hear the TV.
R9DJOVB3W7VX4,5,"I bought these earphones for my husband who has some hearing loss.  As a result of this loss, he listens to the TV at a volume so loud I can barely stand to sit in the same room.  Now he puts on the headphones and I can turn the volume down to a comfortable level for me.  He says they are quite comfortable, and he is very pleased with their performance."
RGWIKV7BRUYLE,2,"This product is priced at the higher end for earphones, yet it is so uncomfortable to wear. The earphones are so stiff, they literally cause you pain in your head and ears to wear them. Not only that, but also ear pads are made of fleece and sponge ( cheap). They make your ears feel so warm and crushed. Sometimes, I even felt strange pain in my head as if the earphone causing some electromagnetic damage to my brain. Sennheiser, should have done better and not cheaped out on them. I tried Bose at Target store, and they felt and sounded so natural and amazing. In fact, they were so gentle on the ears that I literally flet better while they were on than without them ( as if they were made to massage your ears) , let alone the sound quality which was next to nothing. But then they were Bose : (very expnesive ) and they do not make wireless ones for TV ( unfortunately ). While I'm gonna keep the sennheiser ( have no choice ), i still wouldn't recommend them to any buyer  because they never get comfortable on your ears and because they are too heavy on the head.   Reception was good , but then I didn't pay that much just to get good reception. Sennheiser need to work on the design of these before claiming that they are the best in the market."
R1ZK244M2UO5TD,5,So far these headphones are great. I have had them for a couple of weeks now.     My wife has excellent hearing and I don't. Now we can both watch TV in comfort.
R16IVYKLTTLK9F,5,"These head phones were exactly what we needed... my husband and I share a small apartment, and often one of us is working or reading in the same room while the other one wants to watch TV. Now, we can easily watch TV and not disturb the other person. He can watch the game while I work or read or talk on the phone... and he can move around the apartment and listen to the game from different rooms, too. And while he is working, I can watch my TV shows and he doesnt have to go into the other room so he can concentrate.     We were AMAZED at the sound quality. It is much better than our Samsung flat-screen TV speakers... we can hear things that the Samsung TV speakers did not even pick up.     The charging cradle is wonderful and so simple--just put the headphones back on when you're done and there is no hassle, no need to change batteries.     Also, we set this up in less than 10 minutes.     I had looked into trying to buy headphones that plug into my TV with a wire, but apparently my TV model doesn't support that kind of audio device. These, however, worked perfectly, and they are so much better."
R23BLHHQE8GLOE,5,"I received a set of wireless headphones for Christmas from my better half.  Thanks to bad genes, my hearing is significantly worse than my wife's and I guess she finally tired of me turning the volume up too loud while our kids tried to sleep.  Taking the hint, I returned those and ordered these Sennheisers.  I was concerned by the somewhat mixed reviews online, but took the plunge anyway.    Sennheiser is a noted leader of headphone products and I don't think these disappoint.  After hooking these up to my stereo receiver and charging them up overnight, I gave them a whirl.      As many others have mentioned, the volume and tuning controls are right beside each other on the right ear.  As long as you remember that, you won't accidentally change the tuning while trying to adjust the volume.  Yes, it would have been better if one of those swithces had been on the other ear, but oh well...    As for audio quality, I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  The sound is clear enough, but I just expected a bit more.  A little more bass would definitely have made me happier.    All in all, I'm thrilled.  I can now watch my sports without disturbing my kids while they do their homework. How good is that?"
R36SVBX8M0LSEV,5,"YOU COULD MAKE A CONSTELLATION from the STARS that these suckers deserve...SUPERB PERFORMANCE..EXCELLENT...<br /><br />Very airy on the ears..as if your ears have breathing room to not build up a funky itchy sweat...that is a very nice feature. I normally like to use big eared head phones that cup my ears so that I am sure to get all that stereo sound..no need for the cupped ear muff type of head phones...This product is so nice I would have paid double the price around $200.00.<br /><br />UNIQUELY CRYSTAL CRISP CLEAR CRYSTAL LAKE CLEAR CRISP CLEAR CLARITY SOUND...Geez Louise ....These are probably an 9 out of 10...I would like to see more options: volume for both individual speakers, better adjustable feature for the head phones for resting more tightly on my head..<br /><br />With that said, if Sennheiser never improves on this piece of equipment I would never think that I am missing out on necessary improvements.<br /><br />Man these thingerMagigummz are UNIQUELY CRYSTAL BROADCASTING LIVE IN DALLAS, TEXAS CLEAR...<br /><br />WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT...like a I said...I would have paid double the regular price and double the shippping an handling for these..<br />NO need to waste your money on BOSE, SONY, ROCKPORT or whatever...this is the \\""REAAALLLLLL MCCOY BOY\\""....Disregard all those NEGATIVE STARS....that is just BOLOGNA.."
R1FH6CIAS7XZ6P,5,"We needed these for use by a hearing impaired person in the house. The TV was so loud it caused adjoining walls to vibrate. The user reports comfort and surprisingly clear, loud sound quality."
R285FJDW0KMRHI,4,"These headphones solved our problem with audio being heard through the speakers' back wall.  The sound quality is better than I expected although not top of the line.  Surprisingly the headphones receive audio anywhere in the house, even on a different floor.  Downsides are minimal size adjustability and only being able to tune by randomly adjusting an unmarked dial.  Overall I am very pleased with the purchase."
R2C71XGI6JPDMM,5,I use them during my daily workout on a Concept 2 rower.  Set up was an ease. Sound quality is excellent for watching TV while exercising. Family appreciates not having the TV volume blasting away as I exercise. Can't beat the cost. Can't evaluate the battery life since I've had the set for only a month.
R34YULH5KGA1X3,5,"I got this head phones from my sons for Charismas. Now a day we kind of tell each other of what we really want for charismas. I have been looking for a wireless head phone for long time. I was looking into blue tooth, and many brand the price from $20 to $200, but never got a chance to try them because they are no test product available in any store. Any way WOW I love this head phones the first time I put them on I was so happy. 1st. I love the sound because it there is no eco and the sound is so soft and clear. For the movie I don't need surround sound any more because the sound bounce around in my head phone and create nice movie sound. I am really recommending every one to use head phone to watch the shows because I discover many sound that I was missing while I was listening with out the head phones. It is also great when my mom comes over and starts talking none stop, I just put it on. The way it made that I can still hear my wife when she talks to me, but I don't know it a good thing or not Ha Ha. The only 2 things that I don't like is 1. There is not bass adjustment  2. I look kind of big my head, the hard plastic curve around my head make me look like one of those Japanese pilot actor in the Gozara movie. If Sennheiser can make it look, and fit better like one of that Motorola blue tooth, it will be a big improvement.  Add to reviews 12-17-11. it seem to fall off my head easy if I forgot to ben down, and the battery is already not keep charge after a year, but it ok i can but new batteries"
R166IEDP8U0OIQ,2,"I had been looking for a long time for an affordable wireless RF headset and know Sennheiser to be a good company.  The 2 main issues I have with the headset is that you can only wear it for 2 hours max before the batteries go low and it turns itself off and you get this really nasty loud scratchy sound in your ears which is quite startling and horrid.  The other issue is that that loud scratchy sound comes and goes no matter how you have it tuned, so you can be comfortably watching a show and all of a sudden there is a short scratchy loud noise that is totally disruptive.  It comes and goes and re-tuning does not help.  I live in the mountains so I do not have the radio interuptions that would occur in the city so I am not sure why the head set does this continually.  I would not reccomend this set at all  - I have a cheap Sony set that is much better and I wear with my other TV but it is not RF which is why I bought this headset."
R28DPC38IW8KQG,5,"I wanted to get my dad something he'd use, and appreciate.  He is deaf in one ear, and can't hear well out of the other, so when he is watching TV, the rest of us are in pain because the volume is so loud.  The headphones were a snap to hook up, and sound great.    My dad watched TV all night, and the rest of us could keep the volume at a normal level.  I think that for my dad, it was like watching movies for the first time.  He heard background music, and all of the dialogue.  He had never heard these things before!  It was really exciting for him, and for me, knowing that I picked a great gift for him.    I'm not very technical, and my dad is even less so.  These headphones are easy to hook up, and to use.  My family has alot more peace in their house now."
R22CK8RLH55MZ0,5,"Bought these for my wife, she was very happy with them great sound, just like the movies. Would buy again"
R2DFBMUOJV7ITC,5,"I purchased these headphones as a gift for my husband for Christmas. At the end of the day, he said they were the best gift he had received. He wears hearing aids, but still he needed to raise the sound on the TV till it was too high for me. Years ago I purchased his first TV headphones and he only used them for a short while, as he was dissatisfied with the quality of sound. The technology is so much better today, and the sound is remarkable on the headphones. I'm sure when these need to be replaced, we will purchasing another set."
R3OF9V1SDDQESJ,5,Wireless Headphones work as advertised.  Great value for the money.  Very comfortable.  Allows my wife to stay in the room reading or listening to music while I watch football.  She likes them a lot.
R3H9RNHS05CH88,5,"My wife has a set of top brand name hearing aids that cost $6,000.      She constantly complianed that she had trouble hearing the evening news and the movies we watch, and that was with the volume up to about 50 or 65.      I bought this wireless headset for her and now she takes her hearing aids out because of feedback, puts on this wireless headset, make the adjustments she wants and listens without complaint.  I have frequently asked her about what the news, movie, or what a person said, and she tells me exactly what was said.  She like the product so much that she tells all of the family and friends about the wonderful device she got for Christmas and how much it has really helped her hear what was going on.      This product has really helped us both very much and we both are very pleased. Now we can enjoy the news and movies and I don't get my ears blown off with the high volume she use to require to hear !!)  Howard D. Keney"
RYRSYXF17TCCG,5,I love these headphones...it is my 6th time to purchase these...gave them as gifts and everyone I gave them to love them as well.
R1UPYEHTZRHCKP,3,"Sennheiser is an excellent company. We retired a previous Sennheiser wireless headphone kit after 10 years of service and replaced them with the RS120. The sound quality and range is appreciably improved but I'm sorry I didn't look closely at the RS120 before buying. The headphone design is poor.    Our previous headphones had swiveling earpieces and earcups. They stayed in place as you moved about. The RS120 is a more basic design -- no swivel, flat stiff earpieces. The headphones only stay in place if you remain still and vertical.    I recommend Sennheiser wireless phones but look at the RS140 and up."
R2SNIZ0WMWGO1L,5,Have only used the product for a few weeks but so far it is more than I could have expected.  Great reception and comfort.
R2CX4SQVKZYQJS,4,Bought for dad who turns tv up to high all the time.  Provides others in the household some relief.  Dad loves the wireless.  We love the peace and quiet!
R2XH03YTR96PQ5,5,"When a friend mentioned he was looking for wireless headphones I looked up this product to send him a link.  You know how Amazon puts that little note at the top when you've bought this product before?  I was surprised to learn I purchased these 6 years ago!  I knew I've had them for a few years; I just didn't think it was quite that long.<br /><br />I'm happy to report I've had 6 trouble-free years of use from these headphones and they still work great.  In that time we've replaced a plasma TV, a stereo receiver (both of which were purchased at the same time as the headphones), 2 digital cameras and I don't even know how many cell phones my wife has gone through.<br /><br />I use these headphones to watch TV late at night, and sometimes a kid will wear them when I don't feel like listening to a video game.  The headphones have never died on me, even after watching a couple of movies.  If the rechargeable battery ever stops holding enough of a charge I'm not worried - the batteries are standard AA rechargeable batteries so I can easily swap them out for new ones.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good.  They're comfortable  - I can watch a couple of movies in a row without discomfort.  The range is good, and recharging is a snap since the headphones charge while sitting on their cradle.  I've never experienced interference with these headphones (e.g. from a cordless phone or microwave oven).<br /><br />I do wish the controls (volume and tuning) were a little bigger.  If the sound source is muted after a bit you'll hear static in the headphones.  I believe that's a power-saving function, and when the source is unmuted the audio comes right back.<br /><br />As a bonus, I see you can now get the headphones by themselves ([[ASIN:B000EBPJCO Sennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Stereo Wireless Headphone for RS-120 Wireless System]]), so two people can listen to the same source at once.  That would be great for when the kids want to go head-to-head playing videogames.<br /><br />After 6 years I've certainly gotten my money's worth.  I would not hesitate to recommend these headphones...and I have recommended them quite a few times over the years.money's worth.  I would not hesitate to recommend these headphones...and I have recommended them quite a few times over the years."
R2RG742BI57W8W,5,"Gave this to my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  Has told me almost every day how great it is.  He can be watching the football game and it doesn't interfere with other TV watchers, doesn't matter how loud the other TV;s are - he can hear the game.  He can also go to the kitchen, get a snack, outside to let the dog out and still listen to the game.  Best thing about it....I get some sleep.  He can stay awake watching his TV at night and I can go to sleep because there is no sound to tell him to \\""turn it down.\\"""
R115FBWE0BZUU6,4,"When I first received these headphones, I was sorely disappointed when they were hooked up to my TV.  A lot, repeat lot, of static could be heard, making them unusable regardless of tweaking the tuning controls.  Seriously considered returning the unit.  However, when I connected the phones to my stereo, the sound was very good with no static.  The stereo's headphone jack uses output from a pre-amp I believe while the TV just uses signal input levels (no amplification at all on the normal output circuit).  I was able to adjust TV audio output to higher levels using an alternate setting in the setup screens and the static went away.  This apparently reduces the Sennheiser automatic gain control circuit input.  Some static may return if extended quiet periods exist in the TV programming.  Generally, the sound through the headphones is quite good with enough frequency range even compared to my basic wired phones.  The bass is good for this level of phones.  The fit is pretty good on my ears though they do shift around a bit (can't use with Xbox Kinect for example, but couldn't use my old ones either).  The usable distance range is pretty much as advertised.  Also, some reviews indicated that the charging cradle was not easy to use while I found it to be quite convenient and consider it a good selling point.<br /><br />Bottom line: After about 3 weeks of occasional use, I would recommend these conditionally.  The 'conditionally' is that if your TV doesn't allow audio circuit volume output adjustment or the output is not amped at all, these might not work for you."
R3CSG1LHNVFEL1,4,"Bought 2 pairs of these. One so I could use while listening to Christmas music, and one for my father--so he doesn't chase my mother out of the house with the loud TV! I do get some crackling, intermittently, while moving around doing chores, otherwise the sound is excellent. Has been easy to use. Headphones even comfortable for my Dad, who wears about a size 7 1/2."
R2VXSX63FW5YJB,3,I purchased this for not disturbing the other members of the household to listen to my early morning news and it works for that.  I have tried it for music and the range is not good so it hisses when I get more than 15 feet or so away.
R1IO4EDK01PUB,5,"I bought it to use with my TV late at night. Can't comment on the quality of bass, mid-tone etc as I haven't used it to listen to music but definitely money well spent for my purpose. Very good reception and clear TV sound. My head is on the bigger side but I don't feel discomfort after 2 or more hours of continuous use. I keep it charged up when not using it and so have not experienced any battery life issues.    One caution though. I initially used the wireless with the base hooked into the one pin headphone socket on my TV. It didn't work at all well. Then I realized that my TV has two pin audio out which I hooked into. Worked great after that. So think again if you only have one pin headphone socket from your audio source."
R3Y2DQR8208M8,4,The product provides outstanding audio quality with impressive range and great battery life (longer than 5 hours of continuous use.) It is far superior to its wired audio equipment counterparts. I found no wired product in this price range with comparable quality.    Ray
R1APUE0LSR143K,5,"A high quality product.  Worth the extra price.  This is the second pair I purchased, one for the den and one for the bed room."
R156MGS4UFTDNJ,5,Product as described.  Easy to implement instructions.  Blocks noise from TV for others in the room.  Walk from room to room and hear.  Have not had long enough to answer battery life.  Excellent  product so far.
R1BX9N5WRRCGIH,5,"Due to a badly broken ankle  I was in a care facikity for about 7 weeks.   In order to watch TV without disturbing others. I ordered these headphones. They have worked flawlessly.  They feel great and sound very good. They run for hours on a charge, if you first give them a full charge. I have had no problems with them. Also I was stuck in a hospital bed so had to have stafff  connect them to the TV and put the phonrs on the charger. A great product!"
R33EICK6WP9NRB,4,"I have used headphones for privately listening to my own musical practicing for some time, e.g. electric guitar, violin and keyboard.  Having two sets of wires, one for the instrument and one for headphone is a nuisance, particularly for violin where the cables weigh as much as the instrument.  For guitar and violin as well as walkman style CD player, this headphone set is a good solution.  For keyboard the fidelity just wasn't up to par.    There is a periodic problem in a build up of a hissing sometimes.  I attribuite it to a grounding problem.  When I touch the violin strings, the hiss goes away.    Everything I needed was in the box, headset, charger, rechargeable batteries and collection of connectors that allowed me to hook up to 1/4\\"" and MP3 style jacks.  I don't think that I have had any interference from outside sources.  Be patient when you first get them, the initial charge takes about 24 hours.    This served my situation.  I would caution that the sound quality is probably on a par with the usual cheapo MP3 'phones."
R12RN4ZO21ST8J,5,"Love, love, love these headphones.  I purchased a pair a year ago for my husband and he uses them all the time.  This pair was for my father who is 82 years old and hard-of-hearing.  Makes watching TV much more enjoyable for him.  I highly recommend them for anyone who enjoys clear, distinct sound.  Because they are wireless you can walk into another room and still hear the broadcast."
R10LDR2XAJ84ZF,5,"I have only had these headphones about a month, but so far I couldn't be more satisfied.  The sound quallity is excellent and the fit is comfortable.  Installation is not necessarily simple, but then I am not a techie.  It took me some time to get it installed, but eventually I got it going.  It now sits behind the TV, recharging every night.  Good product."
R1OFVT9IFO43G9,5,"I am not an audio snob but I find these to be excellent headphones. The sound quality, range, ease of use, and ability to recharge are all great. It was extremely easy to get setup and I have not experienced any of the buzzing issues that have been reported. I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great wireless solution. You can walk around your house and be able to maintain good quality audio."
R12267V0AFM95I,4,The Sennheiser rs120 work great for watching tv at the volume you want to listen at. They have really clear sound and are comfortable to wear
R460P506VVQ11,2,"These headphones may be OK for some people, but I find them to be uncomfortable and unreliable. I bought them for use with a bedroom TV set. They hiss like crazy, and the sound cuts out occasionally causing REALLY LOUD hissing while you scramble to turn down the volume and re-tune to the channel. After reading the return policy on these from antononline (which states that 99%of the time the item is not defective), I am not even going to try returning them. I will just chalk this up to a bad purchasing decision on my part."
RCFMB8O4JVI61,5,"I own a pair of Sennheiser 170's and they are really excellent headphones but @ over $200 I didn't want to spend as much since major use of these 120's was my bedroom TV. PS, if you're buying a tv these days, be careful to check the back before buying. Most decent size LCDs/plasma's don't have headphone jacks, many do not have RCA audio outputs, and some cheap models don't even have optical outputs. I'm not sure how optical to RCA converters worked, so, I wanted one with RCA audio out in addition to optical, and second choice would be headphone jack. In my humble opinion, RCA-output is the best because there is constant output level and you then control the TV speakers with the mute button on your remote. If you are limited to a headphone jack, the speakers usually are cut out when the phones are plugged in making it necessary to be plugging and unplugging whenever you use the phones and then want to go back to the speakers. Back to the 120's. First of all - sound quality is excellent, tho I don't use them primarily for music, I'd have no hesitation to do so. Unlike the 170 and 180's they don't have features like base boost nor do they have the surround sound simulation that the 170/180's have. PS: this feature on the 170's is really cool and I love using them on my family room tv for action movies. But, back to the 120's: even without these features, the sound is great. Next, reception: unbelievable. I've been all over my house to test them and they work great, even on different floors. Next: comfort. I actually really like the \\""on the ear\\"" fit for my purposes. Soft pads, no irritation, but haven't yet worn for hours. I can say that, since I have both, there is one advantage of these compared with \\""over the ear\\"" fit that is a feature of the 170's. With over the ear, if your head is resting on a cushion/pillow such that the cushion/pillow pushes on the earpiece, it causes the earpiece to put pressure on the back of your ear and actually can cause irritation. It's myone complaint (albeit minor) about my 170's. The one problem wiht the \\""on ear\\"" fit of the 120's is that it is not \\""secure\\"" - i.e, because they fit lightly and comfortably, if you want to wear them while you're say doing a project that requires bending over, they'll tend to slip off your head/ears. If you're sitting, at your computer, lying down for a nap, no problem. But if you''re going to be active with them - like working in the garage or cleaning the house while wearing them, might consider the more secure fit of over the ear. Since they're not over the ear, they're not as noise isolating, but that can be an advantage if you want to know what's going on around you - like hearing your wife calling you or the doorbell, etc. Finally, as for some of the criticisms of others that I've seen posted on these reviews, here's my take:  1. Hiss: non existent. none. I'm using these with RCA outputs on my tv that have constant output and in this mode 0 hiss at any volume even with total silence on the source. If you're using headphone jack output, probably should have the component volume up enough (normal listening level) so you don't have to crank the phones - but I've pushed the volume on these during silence on screen without any hiss!!  2. Unable to charge with earpieces extended. Huh? Maybe they've changed the design of base unit, but this is simply NOT true. I've extended them all the way and set on the base to charge. No problemo.  3. Volume control on same side as tuning wheel. Please.   4. Auto on/off. So far no problem while watching TV.  I suppose if you're pausing dvd's frequently, this could be a minor annoyance, but if you're wearing wireless headphones the need to pause should be minimal, since you can keep listening while you grab a beer in the kitchen or take care of business in the bathroom! Here's the bottom line on this: I TURNED THE TV OFF AND CLOCKED THE TIME-TO-AUTO-SHUTOFF: 3 minutes exactly. So.. how can this be a problem listening to music: suggest if this a problem you are using a headphone jack and the component volume is set incredibly low, turn it up a bit! Oh, yeah, when the base is off, then turn the tv on, the time between tv volume \\""on\\"" and base unit auto on is virtually instantaneous.  Again if, not getting this performance, suspect it is headphone jack and component volume problem.    Overall: this is a great set of wireless headphones at a reasonable price (less than $100 on amazon) and the problems noted by others have either been engineered out of the product over the years (some of the negative reviews are years old), or the folks with problems haven't set them up correctly (using headphone jack with component volume turned too low). For best results, try the rca audio outputs and if you're going to buy a new tv, look for and get a tv that has this feature!"
RYZPPXD7J18HH,3,"1/1/2011 If you plan to move around while wearing these headphone be aware that they will slip off when you look down. You tune them like an old AM radio. They work best if you give them a full day to charge. The Sony headphones are a better choice, they have automatic tuning, auto on/off and stay on your head if you move around."
R28LUCN3E7FAVZ,3,"This is my second unit of this kind.  The first was more expensive, but had better features.  The earpads were cushioned and deeper, and the controls were easier to operate.  For the price, I feel that this set is entirely adequate, and I am enjoying the use of the unit."
R3PKQHK504VBTM,4,"I was so excited to get these headphones--I use them while walking on the treadmill so I don't have to turn the TV up loud.  I took everything out of the box and hooked it all up.  While I'm generally very tech-savvy, I could not get the TV audio to transmit through the headphones.  I kept going over the piss-poor instructions that are included, but I was stumped.  Everything seemed to be hooked up right--the base cords were plugged in to the headphone outlet in the back of my flat-screen TV, the headphones had charged overnight, and the transmit indicator button was lit up.  But nevertheless, nothing would transmit except static.  I was very frustrated and was ready to ship them back to Amazon.  But as a last resort I jumped online and read through the Amazon reviews and discussion boards.  The trick is NOT to plug the base cords into your TV ports.  Instead (assuming you have a cable box hooked up to your TV), run it to the audio ports on your cable box.  Any modern digital cable boxes (ours has a DVR) should have multiple ports in the back.  That was the magic fix!  So easy, but it doesn't say this anywhere in the instructions.  Once I got it transmitting, it worked great and so far I haven't had any problems.  Another trick is to do the same thing with your DVD player.  If you run the base cord directly to the audio port on your DVD player you will be able to transmit the DVD player sound.  But note, no sound will come from the TV so the headphone wearer is the only one who can hear a DVD that is playing.  This only happens with the DVD player, not the TV.  There's probably a way around this, but it's not that important to me to figure it out.  Finally, the headphones stay on my head just fine, even while power walking.  I haven't tried to run with them on, but I still think they would stay on."
RNPQAXH6NTFMX,4,"These are a good set of headphones for the price.     Positives are the comfort, sound quality, balance, ease of use and the fact that you replace, rather than recharge, the batteries.     Drawbacks:  fit is a little sloppy for someone with a small head (my hat size is 6-7/8\\"").  The headphones, even when fully contracted, are loose.  This would not be a problem for someone with a larger head.  The other drawback is connectivity.  Though different connectors are included (two to one prong, and headphone jack), there is no USB connector which makes connection to newer electronics a bit more challenging for back of panel hook-ups.  I suspect this could be remedied by a quick trip to Radio Shack, but would have expected this capability to be provided for with the product.    All in all, a very good product and very high quality."
R21GIL1NVEJQDZ,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He already had one Sennhouser model, but needed one for the bedroom.  We do watch TV before going to sleep.  He is abosultely satisfied with this one.  He can wear it anywhere in the house, even outside, and can still hear his favorite programs.      Hhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FTVEK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlee loves it."
R333U8XX6EI624,5,"Easy to use, right out of the box. Clear reception around house, garage and outside. Mostly for hard of hearing person to adjust volume without blasting others."
R1J3YO0I64N5I4,5,"Love em, love em, love em!!  Can walk all over the house and outside too without losing my connection!  Very comfortable while watching movies.  Crystal clear sound.  Great headphones!"
R16YJ3TVMKGMJ0,5,"Much better than corded versions, due to being able to leave the room.  Even go upstairs to put the laundey in or go to the bathroom, without missing any of the show."
R4MALQ2CP29PK,1,"Don't bother buying these if you are a woman with a small to medium size head. They are unwearable.  Even though they are adjustable; they are so huge to begin with there is no way to make them fit. I am so tired of companies assuming only large men buy electronic products. Hire some women for your quality control, please!"
RLZ4OOBK90UKN,5,I bought these headphones for my husband for Christmas and they have been working great for him.  Sound quality is great. Good purchase for the money so far.
RPU5VU27JDX50,3,"I bought these earphones by looking at all the good reviews. When I got them I thought they were a good looking set. I hooked them up and let them charge for 24 hours. The charge light never went off so I do not know if they were fully charged or not. I turned them on and got the sound from the TV, but I also got a poping sound. I read the instructions and tried a different tunning settings still get the popping to some extent. I have tried moving the transmiter around, still the same. I looked up the one star reviews and could not find the same problem. My next step will be to call Sennheiser."
R19CW8Q4LKP33W,5,"Bought this wireless headphone set for my wife for a Christmas gift and tried to get it connected up to our Sony Bravia LCD TV today. I connected the base unit to the Audio Out (RCA jacks) on the back of the set, and the audio came through the wireless headphones loud and clear, along with the regular TV speakers. So I pressed the Mute button on my TV remote to quiet the speakers, but it also killed the audio coming from the headphones. The instructions that came with the headphones offered no help or hints about a solution.<br /><br />I studied the Sony TV users guide and discovered that the Audio Out jacks had two modes - Variable and Fixed. Variable means the output varies with the volume control. Fixed means the output is constant - not affected by the volume control or mute. As it turns out, whether the output is variable or fixed is configured by the Sound Settings in the XMB (Xcross Media Bar) accessed via the Home menu on the Sony Bravia remote. Once the Fixed Autio Out setting was selected, the sound on the TV speakers could be Muted, and the wireless headphones worked as expected. Hope this helps"
R2XG5A73XD6QRF,4,"I bought my father these wireless headphones for Christmas this year. The Sennheiser name is what definitely caused me to put as much faith in these headphones as I did. We have only had a couple of days to try the phones out, but they have done nothing but proved their worth to us. The setup is effortless, quick and easy. The reception is clear (after a little flicking of the tuning dial), and the sound is crisp and surround. The docking station easily cradles the headphones and fits easily, and painlessly on the ears. Hopefully, I will not need to come back in a couple months and edit my review. Overall, when complimented with the reasonable price, there are no other headphones that you should take your chances with. Make a great investment that's worth the couple extra bucks."
R10KJJL341H6PO,4,"Got a great deal (45$) and love the headsets so far.    Breaking review in sections -  1. Delivery and Handling : Very happy, on time delivery and headset arrived in mint condition.    2. Quality of headset - 4 starts   - The headset works great while listening music from various MP3, WAV players etc on my PC   - When watching low quality movies, converted videos there is a very audible hiss that can be heard   - When watching high quality DVD or Blue ray movies the sound quality is just great   - Once I removed the electric wiring clutter around the base unit the sound quality improved even better.   - Gave 4 starts as I am not able to get FM radio on the head set. Also there doesn't seem to be any options to select the same.  - Surround sound audio sounds ok    - The part I like best is that I can walk out of the room to a different room and still the same audio quality. It doesn't fade.   - Once charged I can watch movies at lengths. Tried for 4 hours and it worked great without any loss in quality.   - I have tried using the headsets for 3-4 hours at a stretch and have no difficulty wearing the headset or any ear discomfort    3. Looks - 3.5 stars   - Well who cares about the looks so much. These look and feels just fine and are not heavy at all.    Hope this helps :)"
R2VLP3M106B3Y8,5,"I have been back living with my parents for about a year now. And while there are many perks to it (no rent) there has been one MAJOR drawback. My father is going deaf. Like completely in his right ear and about 40% in his left. On top of this, he is a night owl and wants to watch random t.v. in the middle of the night. I go to work at 8 am so I am sure you can see how this doesn't work out. But I finally had the bright idea to get him these for Christmas and it has already proven to be the most amazingly brilliant thing ever. He was up almost all last night and I wasn't bothered at all. Hopefully this will be an end to our late night battles of the t.v. volume, so far it has been and I am soooo thankful."
R2G5KPE8NG5A3U,4,"Pros: Wireless, better-than-expected sound quality, lightweight, easy to charge, overall great.    Cons: Lots of places where I experienced fuzz, difficult to get used to, setup was a pain.    Overall, this was a really good buy for the price. However, there is a key issue I'd like to stress, is that if there is no audio to send, the base will not turn on. It seems to have a mind of it's own, which is frustrating when I'm not listening to anything, it turns off and starts to fuzz. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to make the base turn on, which was no explained at all in the instructions. It's a cool function, but REALLY needs to be better explained. My technical ability is above average, so that should give some explanation as to how difficult it may be, depending on your approach. Another issue is fuzz. Initially, at home I experience a lot of fuzz, while using my HDTV (I was practically 1 foot away from the base). At work, I am experiencing practically zero fuzz sitting at my desk, and a light hiss when I'm walking around the office. It could be device-specific, but I would be weary of RF interference in your household.    Good buy. Glad I spent the money."
R370ZRLEKFRMX8,1,"I ordered this in November to make sure it was here for Christmas, It was, but it does not work!!!! Need to return now, hope it goes well!!!"
R2OWAO8AXVR0X9,5,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    Sports is a big thing in my sons life (15 years old) and the new earphones have brought quiet to our home and so they are no only enjoyed by my son  but by the rest of the family because of the quiet.  Excellent buy!!!
RABICA5IURM5U,3,"I mostly like these headphones. They have saved my marriage. I'm hard of hearing, and the family got sick of telling me to turn the TV down. I got sick of turning it up to hear over them.<br /><br />So we don't fight about it anymore. Big plus there.<br /><br />But this uses a weak radio transmitter using older analog technologies. So even the smallest little bit of radio interference means you're going to hear static. And you *will* hear static from time to time.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed these headphones a lot more, I think, if they used a digital technology such that you either have a signal or you don't. Maybe Bluetooth A2DP would have been overkill. I won't prescribe the exact solution, only point out that the analog technology, while cheaper, does present problems that can be avoided today."
R3E9DTCTCLDEFJ,4,"This is a realy good headphone.Every thing works fine.I only had one issue with it.  When I left it on for about 5 to 10 min and there is no sound playing on my tv or pc,  it makes a loud noisy sound."
R3OV3Z6UTWE9GM,4,"I purchased these for use at my office.  I had already gone through three headphone sets in 2 years.  Between dealing with cables too short to move around my workspace and losing sound on one side because the cable was stretched or pinched too much, I felt I had to find a cost effective solution that did not involve broadcasting my music to the entire office.  After checking Sennheisser's website, I settled on this set.      This is probably the single best headphone purchase I have ever made.  It took less than one minute to set it up. I can easily move around without ripping anything off my desk.  In moving 20-25ft from the base, I have no drop off in sound.  I usually leave it on the entire workday (8hrs) and never had it run low on a single charge.  The sound exceeded my expectation on music.  I will admit, there is an annoying hiss/hum when I just listen to talk radio or podcast (ie only when vocal sound is only output is it noticeable).  Besides the hissing/humming, there is a small crack that has developed on left side of the headband.  This is a related to the design of the headband and the fact that I have a huge melon for a head.  It has not affected the use of the product.  Overall, I am glad I made this purchase and would easily recommend them to anyone else.    It requires external power for the base (wall plug), two AA batteries for the headphones (included), and an audio source.  The connections for the audio source are default stereo RCA (red/white).  However, it comes with an adapter (3.5mm stereo jack) to allow you to plug it into your iPod or other audio device."
RVRU1K1CELR0U,5,"This is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anybody out there looking for a way to enjoy television without disturbing the ones you love.  We bought these over 6 months ago because my wife and I enjoyed watching TV together in the living room after our kids went to sleep at night but our daughters room and the living room are separated only by a non-insulated interior wall and she is a light sleeper so we had to keep the volume at such a low level that we could barely hear any of the dialogue.  Once I started looking for wireless headphones, I clicked over to amazon.com (as I usually do) and started my search.  Instantly, I was drawn to these because of the great reviews, good name brand recognition, ease of charging, expandability, etc and I must say I'm glad I picked them up.  We got two sets with the charging cradles as we keep one of the cradles/transmitters in the living room and one in our bedroom since each can use separate frequencies.  Sound quality and range are both very good in my opinion, but I wasn't looking for any thing with crystal clear sound.  In sound quality, these can't compare to my wired noise-cancelling head phones, but they do their job exceedingly well.  If I try hard enough, I can usually pick up a very faint hisss typically associated with wireless devices such as these and on occasion I'll experience a short burst of static (less than a second), potentially due to the countless other wireless devices in my home but it's never bothered me enough to look into it.  Despite the fact that most audiophiles probably wont be satisfied with the sound quality (not saying it's bad by any means, but it is wireless afterall) I would still HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anybody in the market for them.    5 starts because these were exactly what I was looking for and do the exact job I expected them to do."
R3117COOR3LHJT,5,Got these to replace different brand pair.  These are the best I've had so far and I haven't had any problems with them.  Good value for what I paid.
R30WWXSXMWWJ4A,5,Sound Quality is very good for a wireless headphone set.  I haven't had any issues with the battery life. The headphones are comfortable and the range is great.  I only get some hiss when on the other end of my apartment through several walls.
RG4IF4O5N785V,4,"I have a cheap, noisy treadmill, and after digital TV came to our area, I needed a new way to listen to the TV audio while working out. This set works great for my purpose. My only complaint is that the headphones are big and clunky, and if I bend over they tend to slide off. The charging cradle is convenient, although the headset sometimes slips off the contacts unless you extend it to its maximum length and kind of prop the earpieces against the sides of the cradle. The controls are convenient, range is good and the sound is lots better than my tinny TV speakers."
R2ZLFU44GMYS2M,4,"Pros: Awesome battery life        Wireless range is amazing- two floors away (and in the basement!) and the sound quality does not degrade        Wireless Interference is easy to adjust for- head phones provide a mechanism to shift the signal to a better band.         Sound Quality is good        Came with adapters to allow it to work with just about anything.        VERY easy to keep charged. Just drop on the cradle when you're done- no plugs, no mess.    Cons: When no sound is being transmitted, it can be staticy and hissy.        There is an underlying noise that I can only hear with very soft music (not loud.. dynamic range soft) - You may be able to hear this more than I do.        *If you wear glasses (I do) they do get a bit uncomfortable after awhile.     Overall, very much worth the price. The only real issue is the comfort issue with glasses after awhile. Everything else is superb."
R2LA3FNYUO44HB,4,"There is a white noise hiss in the background that is easy to filter out if you're watching TV or something that the sound is not mission critical, but if you are listening to a classical CD it will drive you nuts.    Also, if you have a large head (like me) it's difficult to leave the headphones adjusted AND fit easily on the charging rack. I have to finesse it a little bit every time.    All in all, for my purposes these are great. I don't have to worry about the dog ripping the receiver off the shelf and my wife doesn't have to listen to my tv shows."
R1WLTXQ8PREWA1,4,"I bought these for TV listening and I have not tried them on any other source. As I have aged my hearing has gotten less acute. I had trouble hearing conversations in programs with the volume at a reasonable level for everyone else in my home. I tried the TV Ears as advertised on television. They were uncomfortable to me. These are very comfortable and work well for my purpose. I only have a couple of negative issues. First, while it is simple to set the headphones on the cradle, they have to be set just right on the cradle or they won't charge. Second, there is a sort of echo effect with the TV sound from the speakers coming through at a slightly different rate than through the headphones. I am willing to put up with that so I can hear other conversation and sounds from around me though."
R39GRFRXW2V30G,5,"These did not change my marriage.  However, they did improve my relationships with the three other engineers in my bay. They sound good to me. However, I must also add the qualifier that having been in the Field Artillery,  I wear hearing aids (behind the ears)so my evaluation of the sound may or may not be accurate. They are very comfortable have good reception.  I can not really evaluate the range due to the steel buildings on our site. They do, however, reach through one of the steel walls. They company shipped them very quickly and they arrived in good condition.  I especially like the ease of replacing the rechargable batteries."
RCEZ00DYWEKNH,4,"First, I listen too a lot of \\""talk\\"", Bloomberg, CNBC, NPR, PBS, News, etc, etc.. Second, I live in a one bedroom condo with a terrace.    The sound quality is just fine for my use. The reception is just fine inside and out. It's just terrific to be able to listen out on the terrace without my laptop or a 1/4 mile of four different types of extension cords with connection adapters and knots. I can't comment on the battery life, as I don't use it for \\""extreme lengths of time\\"". I can tell you that it lasts with, no problem, for at least four hours.    As far as previous comments about a \\""blast of static\\"". Well, if you move the tuning control, or move too far out of range, you'll lose reception and hear static, that's all. Also, I've had no problem with the signal dropping out.    My main complaint? Well, the headset seems to be designed for a square head. Yes, that's right. It fits very well on a box or better, on a truncated wedge, like a slice of pie with the front cut off.     Also, it doesn't sit well on the cradle and charge. You'll have to move it around. I try to get the earcups to catch the front edge of the cradle and that does it. Also, the right angle power plug on the cradle side doesn't sit flush and extends out about a millimeter from the bottom. Just enough to be annoying. I don't want to wall mount it because I have several devices that I use it on. What you see in the product's photo is the headset precisely balanced. (The phtographer was probably holding his breath while taking that picture.)    All in all, I like it and I'm glad I purchased it. The price and quality balance out nicely. Good buy!"
R1ZJN1ZWD02FE1,5,"Have just had these headphones for about a week.  So far, I am very happy with the purchase.  Here's what I like:  - VERY comfortable even after using them for 4 or 5 hours (note that these headphones are a little on the bulky side; not exactly portable, but still very comfortable).  - sound quality is very good (I confess: I am not an audiophile).  At first, I felt that the sound was weighted more to the right side and was wishing they had a balance control to tweak it, but then found you can sort-of do that using the tuning control.  Caveat: with these headphones I upgraded from mono headphones to stereo...  - headphone batteries charge automatically when headphones are placed on the cradle.  Great feature.  Not having to remove the batteries to charge them is a huge plus!  So I used the headphones in the evenings and they charged overnight and were ready for use next morning.  - quality of materials used appears to be very good (however, I have only had these for about a week, so cannot currently comment on durability)  - Price: a great buy AND at this price point. (Wishing I had bought these a long time back!)"
R1OZC334V369HZ,4,The spunge ear pads come loose too easily . After about 25 days the product stopped working totally with no sound.I still think that it is a good product .I am returning it and re-ordering another one.
R1571AQMTGTJB8,5,"We had the usual arguments over TV volume. My sweetie wanted her TV in the kitchen area to be loud, I wanted it to be quiet so I could hear my TV. This is a pretty standard problem with open-space living and great-rooms.<br /><br />I decided that this would never be resolved until I acquired some headphones. I researched some wireless units and decided to go with the Sennheiser RS120 based on reviews here at Amazon. These headphones are perfect for TV listening. Note that they feature large,flat ear pads which are designed to spread ear pressure over a large area so you can listen comfortably for hours. Typical earphones with small pads or &#34;around the ear&#34; design can sometimes begin to hurt a bit after an hour or so. Not the case with these bad boys. I liked them so much I bought two more as Christmas gifts.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Great price here at Amazon<br />* Easy hook-up<br />* Charging cradle works well<br />* Long lasting charge<br />* Wireless reception works well and is adjustable. Good range, I can go outside on patio.<br />* Sound quality is good.  I also use them for stereo music while I work in my shop.<br />* Wife is happy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* A bit of a sloppy fit on head. Can slide forward and fall off if you lean too far forward. Guys....be careful at the toilet.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-26-15:  We now use two of these everyday and they are great. Super long range reception all over our house and yard. We love them so much we bought a spare just in case Sennheiser decides to discontinue for some reason. We did try a Bluetooth headphone at one point but it was a FAIL due to very short range. We'll stick with the Sennheiser's."
RGRIHYD0CVQYQ,4,"Getting old is neither fun nor easy. Hearing is one of the things that fails and I refuse to try a hearing-aid, for now. The problems started when I sat in the living room listening to TV and husband was in the other room trying to listen to a different TV program. He tried to convince me to lower the sound, I cried I can't hear. Someone suggested headphones. When I started my research I was overwhelmed with information. I decided to look up Amazon's reviews. I do trust these reviews as I myself am a contributer. I saw that the Sennheiser RS120 had the most reviews and out of 1449 reviews 1029 thought this product was 5 or 4 stars. I must admit that some reviews discussing musical merits or failures eluded me, but I decided to gamble and buy the Sen. headphones, knowing I can return them if I am unhappy.<br /><br />I have used them only a few days now, I can't say much. I had to read the instructions, they were easy and clear and within half an hour I was sitting with my new sat watching TV. I do not have hissing noises, the sound is great. I can walk around my apartment and still hear the program with no problem. I even walked out to the staircase and still could hear everything quite clearly. I think the wirelss option is a must. My husband comes now days to check if I am still alive and breathing as  the house is totally quiet. The only problem so far that I encountered is that the headset is bulky and the ear piece does not fit quite snugly around the head. This caused some pain to my ears. I tried to adjust and I will need to learn how to wear the headphone so it does not hurt my ears (I have a big head).<br /><br />I will add to my review in a few weeks or month, I think more use will enable me to write a more complete review for this product. For now I am happy."
R2619KWG0B2H4L,4,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    This product just arrived today and the shipping was really fast. At first I was a little disappointed because I thought that there was not an 3.5 mm headphone adapter/receiver for my iPod but I realized that it was nested within the larger adapter/receiver. The charging station is really simple to use and there are also cords for you to connect the base to a TV/DVD/Blueray player etc. The cords for this are red and white...I think those are just audio cords. The item was a gift for someone else so I'm not sure about the quality of the headphones yet but they leave a pretty good first impression.
RA88SV4EY443O,1,"These headphones work for about 10 minutes and then the wireless sender shuts off and the headphones start blasting loud white noise into your ears. To reset it, you need to get up from the couch, walk up to the sender, unplug (!) the sender from the sound source. Ten minutes later, you'll get another blast of white noise.    This seems to be caused by what a Sennheiser \\""engineer\\"" thought was a good idea: Auto-Shutoff. If the sound source signal is low for a while, the sender thinks that there's no sound to transmit and shuts off. The receiver in the headphone loses the signal and starts blasting white noise at a level that drives you up the wall. Apparently, at Sennheiser labs, their \\""engineers\\"" only watch movies with explosions every 60 seconds, so this problem doesn't manifest itself. How this terrible design can pass any form of QA is beyond me. And of course there's no way to override this feature with a switch, because Sennheiser knows what's good for us.    This shoddy product went straight back to Amazon."

R3BQWWUXHVI1WU,5,"When hubby was at work, I would often turn on a computer radio program to listen to while I did housework. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with our current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.  UPDATE - 3/17/15 -  I must say, after 4 1/2 years of almost daily use, 2-3 hours at a time, on the same batteries supplied I might add, all I can say is I would give these headphones a 10* if possible!!! They work from one end of the house to the other 65' long -  they work great outside for yard work with all windows closed. They work fine all the way to the end of my driveway about 200' long. On almost 3/4 acre, I haven't found anywhere they don't pick up the signal strong and clear. I have recommended these to several people who have bought them and are pleased. If they ever fail, I will buy another pair just like them. The only negative thing I have found is what others mentioned in that they can fall loose when leaning forward. Knowing that, I just slide the top band a little further back when I will be bending over and problem solved. So to me, there is nothing negative that can't be fixed with little effort.  A+, 10* and great headphones. I am VERY happy and that happens very seldom with purchases these days.  So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but onlypassing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.  To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.  If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2&#34; and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.  The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.  In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone."
R1RIY7Y62GFJFR,5,"Bought these headphones so I could hear TV while on the treadmill without cranking the TV volume way up.  They work perfectly.  I'm about 16' from the TV and don't have any problems.  Just to try them, I walked about 20 yards away into the yard and they still worked.  I didn't lose reception until I walked around the corner of the house and was about 25 yards away with a couple of walls in the way.  I don't sweat that much and for inside during the winter, they're fine.  I'll probably walk outside in the nice weather and use something else then."
R3H8RRBDGXVXJZ,3,"To keep it short and sweet:    Excellent sound quality, Excellent wireless range, Excellent charging time. Then the worst feature ever. AUTOSHUTOFF. It's super annoying that I am giving this 3 stars. If I'm watching youtube videos and reading comments or writing email or whatever at the same time, I have to keep reminding myself to turn it off or unplug and replug the jack again otherwise I'll be punished badly. All the reviews here are real but I didn't listen. I would still keep it for sound quality but I am everyday annoyed at this feature and I don't seem to get used to it.     As other mentioned the tuning and volume controls are close to each other but you can get used to it with practice. Doesn't always still still on my head (and I have a big head) but again nothing that worries me much since I'm usually sitting or I can mount them in a certain way so they don't fall when I'm lying down (watching a movie).    Never ran out of charge, maybe only once when I forgot it for a couple days.    I wish they also had a headphone jack in the headset so that I can use it as portable headphone."
R3BWELHNU1KI6G,4,"Good product, but strong hissing sound by ANY electrical appliance; light, massage chair, stereo receiver, cordless phone etc. You have to fine tune almost every time you change your sitting position, or you can change your sitting position again to avoid interference. I give an above okay on headset comfort factor."
RPMBH093J0UZ6,4,"I work the night shift on the floor of a manufacturing facility where I am  surrounded by modern machinery, electric panels, computers, a wi-fi network,   rows of fluorescent lighting and concrete block walls,   so I was hesitant to try a wireless headset.    My main listening interests are sports talk, ballgames, news programs, and talk shows.  The headphones are hooked into my satellite radio boom-box via the headphone jack   (with the volume on the boom-box turned up all the way).   Well let me tell you, I receive great reception and quality  at 90 yards (and that is with about 50 machines between myself and  the transmitter).  Only the slightest crackling and minor hissing can be heard at that distance.  Being about 60 yards away from the transmitter with a concrete block wall and 30 machines  between, the audio is sufficient enough with some crackling, hissing and breakup.  While in my main work area (about 2000 sq. ft) and in direct line of the transmitter,  the audio is spot on with absolutely no crackling, no hiss and no interference.    I cannot \\""accurately\\"" comment on the music quality b/c I do not have \\""an ear\\"" for it,   but it's as good as any 'wired' headset or ear buds that I have owned.    The placement of the dials do not present a problem for me.  I have no difficulty adjusting the volume, tuner or on-off switch,  even with work gloves on.  These headphones are worn daily for a  minimum of 8 hrs. a day, and don't lose a charge.  You can tell  when the batteries are dying when the audio quality starts to diminish.  They are plenty comfortable (even w/ safety glasses on) with ample padding.    My only complaint (and it may be genuine to me) is the fit.    I have a good sized melon (7 5/8) and these seem to wiggle a  bit while I am working.  I do some lifting and reaching at work   and while doing so, I sometimes have to try to keep my head level so the headphones   don't slide down or back.  Again, this may be unique to me as I may have  stretched these beyond their capacity. =)    I highly recommend these headphones and would have given  them a 5-Star review had I just used them in an \\""idle\\"" position."
RYTAEHLL868RV,3,Great sounding with clear reception. The only negative is they do not want to stay on your head when you are moving around. If you walk around without moving your head you will be very happy with this headset.
R1FUS955SVWBQY,5,"My husband and I live in a 1 bedroom condo and these are amazing!!  We can watch TV without disturbing the other (personally I think he likes it better b/c it is harder to hear me if he has the headphones on than if he was watching football without them, VERY easy to tune out the other person).  But they are a great deal for the money.  Not the most attractive things you'll ever put on your head.  But comfortable, great sound quality, no issues with battery life, easy to store somewhere and charge.  It's great watching TV with them because you can walk from room to room, go outside and take out the trash, go to the bathroom, and you get the same great sound quality wherever you are - instead of having to turn up the TV if you're in the next room.  We can literally walk to the other side of our large condo building and not get any interference.  We were excited to get these and the reality has even surpassed our expectations.  The only annoyance is that the tuner knob and volume are right next to each other - but it's really not a big deal, and not like you're changing the volume after you put them on anyway."
R3L2233USHP8Z8,4,"Allows me to move around the office without dangling ear-bud wires or having to carry my iPhone around with me. Not the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, but the positives outweigh the negatives.  I've had these about 6 weeks with no problems."
R2BYBA592MTKD5,4,"Great sound and true quality built into these headphones.    Little disappointed in the comfort. They tend to want to \\""SQUEEZE\\"" your ears, resulting in a painful feeling. Advertised as ear-cups. But ear-cups fit over and completely around the ear, never actually touching or pressing on the ears. These have a cup in the middle, but it's way too small to fit around your ear. The result is after a few hours of wearing these headphones, you want to take them off and give your ears a rest."
R2KAF6KNQCW4N0,5,"I love this product.  I have used it with everything possible for the wireless solution.  As long as there is an Audio out on the listening device, this product works!!  I have connected to my laptop, TV, and my Audio system.  It works perfect with all.    Haven't found the battery life particularly lacking, though I have to observe that for a few more weeks."
R277ZH0ACQXZVQ,3,"I have had these for a while now.  The batteries stopped taking a charge, but they were easily replaced with a set of duracell rechargeables.  The headset is too big for my head.  If I was walking around this would be a big problem but I wear them in bed and a little big is good, because I can just push them off in my sleep.  The do take a licking bouncing off of my bed frequently when I roll over, or when the dog rolls over on them, and they STILL work fine.    My biggest complaint and this is a BIG one is the design of the tuner is too close to the volume control. Every time I go to adjust the volume I end up messing up the tuning.  Also when they fall out of my bed the tuning gets messed up.   I use them with a TV that has a loose wire in the headphone jack.  So my speakers or headphones cut out a lot.  Often I don't know if the reason I am not getting sound is due to the TV or the tuning knob.  I can spend 15 min.  jiggling wires on the TV only to find out it was the tuner on the headphones that was off."
R76WBG6DML8AR,2,"Ok.  Bought with high expectations.  Opened the packaging, charged for 24 hrs. Got home, turned on the tv and the headphones.  Nothing.  Thought maybe it's a lemon.  So tried it with computer.  Worked perfectly.  Ending to story.  It did not work with my tv.  Wish it had a compatability list showing which tv's it didn't work with.  Feel ripped off.  But eh, I have some nice Computer headphones."
R33IN1Y6UE52JT,5,"I have a hearing loss and need the volume high on the tv but my wife does not like it loud. These headphones make watching tv much more enjoyable for both of us. The sound is crisp and clear. I purchased the RS120s 6 months ago and use them almost every day. I don't really know how long the battery last mine has never went dead, and I have used them for over 10 hours at one time. Easy to charge just set them on the stand. I recommend these headphones."
R1EFQZEEOJXILL,3,"Product works well, but it is a bit bulky on my head and it weighs too much. I would prefer something with a smaller \\""headprint\\""."
R1RFJ7XRWODYKH,4,"We have used many different FM and Infrared wireless earphone sets for watching TV for 20 years or so. The Sennheiser is near the top of the list but for us old folks they could still be improved. Our biggest complaint is lack of a comfortable fit. Check out Sony's design of surrounding the earphone with a pillowy cushion that feels good when put on and still feels comfortable three or four hours later. Second  complaint with the Sennheiser has to do with the tuning and volume controls. When your finger tips start losing their sensitivity, it gets difficult to find the small controls in the dark. When I want to change the volume, I always end up turning the tuning control. Then I have to fumble around getting it tuned again and then change the volume while I lose track of what happened on the screen. Once adjusted the sound quality is good even for our poor hearing. We gave up on our old Sonys because they had a special NiMH rechargeable battery that is no longer available. Planned obsolesence I  guess! Our new Sennheisers use standard NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries and so far they have held their charge for longer than we can listen at one time. I also like their recharging unit which depends on metal to  metal contact unlike the Sonys. We'll keep using and enjoying our new units even though they aren't the most comfortable but never losing hope that the perfect  wireless earphones are out there somewhere."
R1A4JZMS3PJA20,5,"I wanted to replace an RCA wireless headphones that were several years old and finally quit working.  I read all the reviews on wireless headphones and liked what I read about this set.  These are awesome!  They were a breeze to set up. The wire holder that the headpiece rests on is what charges the recharable batteries, too, a very clever idea. The sound quality, to me, is great, especially compared to my old set. The headpiece is light weight, adjustable, and comfortable.  My ears don't end up hurting from being pressed against my eyeglasses either. These headphones can only be used with recharagable batteries but that shouldn't pose a problem for most people. I'm very happy with these headphones!"
R89BDMY8430NO,4,"I bought these to replace a very old set of RCA wireless headphones that were literally falling apart from years of use.  This Sennheiser set works fine.  No wireless headphones are going to provide the perfect sound you'd get from very expensive wired headphones, but these come close.  Set-up was easy and they provide several adaptors in the box which should allow connection to just about any kind of audio out (except optical digital).  The headphones fit comfortably, though the are a little tight against the ear, probably because they are still new and I have a big head, but on the plus side, that keeps them in place -- they don't fall off or shift position when you move your head or bend over to pick something up.  And the speakers stay close to the ear.  My old RCA headphones had a cushioned cup that surrounded the ear.  These have a flat padded earpiece that simply presses against the outside of the ear.  They're still comfortable, and that design should minimize \\""sweaty ear syndrome.\\""  Recharging is easy -- just place the headphones on the base station cradle -- nothing to plug into the headphones as there was on my old RCA set.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't notice any hiss on these, but I use them more for TV than for music.  Also, the reported problem of their shutting off if the sound source is quiet (e.g., a very silent part of a movie or TV show, or very soft music) was also common with my previous RCA set, so it doesn't really bother me.  As has been noted in another review, if that starts to happen with a particular show, turn up the volume on the sound source and turn down the volume (as needed) on the headphones.  Reception was fine -- no interference, static, etc.  So far, I'm very pleased with the product."
R3PLC9ZSIVXIP6,2,"This review really pertains to the Amazon exchange policy.  RS120 headphones were purchased as a gift to be given on 11/16; the return option expired on 11/18.  I made the mistake of ordering them in advance and not setting them up as soon as I received them.  After exchanging several emails with the manufacturer it was determined on 11/30 that the product should be returned due to a probable faulty connection.  The headphone set could not be tuned to eliminate the static though they did work fine for about 2 days.  A friend of mine has the same model and they work beautifully.  The receiver was connected to two different TV sets for testing.  The slightest move of the head brought on static and eliminated any reception there might have been.  If the Amazon exchange policy were more gift-friendly I'm sure I'd be writing a more positive review.  However, the product that I received was not in working condition.  Therefore, I rate it poorly for out-of-the-box performance and I am disappointed with Amazon's lack of flexibility for customer support.  Also, I am unable to access Amazon's feedback section - I get a Thanks screen which also states 'You currently have no more feedback to leave.'"
RBWRR94SZQE78,1,"I've purchased two of these headsets.  The first works great, the second not so much.    Within a month the second unit would not hold a charge for more than a half hour.  I called Sennheiser service and was told I could either purchase a new set of batteries or send the unit in for warranty service.  Their website states that if they can't fix it the unit would be replaced.  I sent it in.    After waiting for two weeks I called to get status.  It had been logged in but was still in the box.    I called a week later to get status.  It was still in the box.    I called a week later.  It was still in the box.  I asked when would it be repaired or replaced.  The lady replied that they had no parts and no replacement units and she had no idea when they would get any parts or replacements.  I asked her to return the unit so I could return it to Amazon.    I got a call an hour later stating the unit had been repaired and would be shipped UPS two day.  That was a week ago.  The unit has not been delivered.    I'll call again but hope is fading.    Would I recommend this product or anything else from Sennheiser?  Not in this life time."
R16G4KKY07N00L,3,"RS 120 is a decent unit with a good transmitter/charger base.{same base as more expensive Sennheiser units) The head phones work well enough but they are designed to not fit as well as the more costly units. The seller, Electronics Expo, is an absolute no no. Their phone system is impossible to work with because they are so far off shore. Via email I have been dealing with them for a month to get a defective unit replaced. No More 3rd party sellers for Me."
RMNDQO488N2P9,2,"After purchasing and spending a few days with these headphones, I'm wondering how on earth they can be given positive reviews...<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very well built<br />-Batteries last a long time<br />-Nice packaging<br />-You can add as many headphones as you want for other listeners<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very muddy bass with heavy distortion. I tried several different sources and I tried all three channels and the problem didn't go away.<br />-Quality control issues. I had bought an add-on set of headphones at the same time and the quality of the bass was slightly better in those but still completely unacceptable.<br />-Analog wireless signal with an always present and annoying hiss.<br />-They shut off after a small amount of either silence or near silence, making them unusable for computer audio.<br /><br />I very seldom send something back, but these headphones are very disappointing and are back in their boxes. I'm so afraid of wireless now that I'll just buy a long extension cord for my existing headphones."
RDNR0H2LGT0P0,4,This is the second unit we have purchased for viewing tv at night without disturbing anyone.  Our first unit is over 6 years old and still going strong.  Mother staying with us is hard of hearing and wanted to not bother everyone.  Works wonderfuly.  Wish they could make them a little more comfortable on the ears.
R1E1O17TWRGLZC,2,These were highly rated and very popular which swayed my decision to these over other sets.  Do not follow the crowd reception is poor with low output and small poorly laid out controls.  Nice idea but not well executed.
R2KN6AX7F591TQ,5,My husband likes to have marathons of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings and now I don't have to listen to them anymore! These headphones are also great for when one of us wants to watch a movie after the kids have gone to bed. I wish the headphones were available in a pair so we could watch late night movies together without the sound turned down.
RKOJ1HM7FVA36,5,"They work great and sound great! If you adjust the sound and tune them right there is no static or other noise noticeable like other people say. I love them for watching tv when my room mates are asleep. Great sound, great confort, no problems. There does have to be sound streaming to them in order for the base to power on, which i did not know previously and got me confused when the base power light was not on when plugged into the wall. Great product other than that slight bit of confusion. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set of wireless headphones. The range is just fine and can easily penetrate walls. The farthest away i have tested is about 10 yards, but i dont need to get too far from the tv."
R14HQ38NPU6RGU,5,"I'm happy with the product, however there is NO WAY you can use an optical/audio that Amazon advertises along side the product as \\""frequently used together\\"".  I hope Amazon can drop this false advertising with the headphones."
R2UWGMK1KR1529,5,"These are the best wireless headphones I've owned to date, and also a tremendous value. Great sound and range, easy to charge, extremely comfortable. Only downside is that they can slip off my head when I wear them while doing things around the house, but they are very comfortable. I use these in the bedroom, but I am about to order a second pair for the TV in the den."
RCZHU01OXJR8N,4,Like the title says....it works doesn't interfere with the other Sennheiser set that we have so that's enough for me.
R3H11DLZK4ALK,5,"I LOVE my wireless headset. I can walk outside and garden while listening to music. If I am up late watching movies, I don't have to worry about disturbing my neighbors. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. I have already recommended them to friends. Very pleased with this purchase !!!"
R1KDYPQ5UG0YWL,4,"Pros: Light weight; great aural frequency response; quality sound reproduction; easy set-up.<br /><br />Cons: Some RF interference from other accessories on my desktop.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: If you are in need of quality wireless headphones you could do a lot worse than the Sennheiser RS-120.<br /><br />As I stated in my Logitech MX3200 Cordless Desktop review, I dislike clutter.  And my desk at work is configured such that the keyboard, mouse and headphone cords run across the desktop and not only create an eyesore, but also get in the way of work.  So I had to find a solution.  I decided to go wireless; i.e. wireless keyboard, mouse and headphones.  The first device I purchased was the aforementioned Logitech Cordless Desktop MX-3200, which mates a wireless keyboard with a wireless MX-600 laser mouse.  The second purchase was a set of Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless (stereo) Headphones.<br /><br />The Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones are designed for use with Hi-Fi audio, television, or computer.  The open air RF (radio Frequency) German-made headphones are designed to provide a rich palate of aural sound (frequency response rated at 22Hz - 19500Hz) through walls as well as ceilings allowing one to roam throughout the house while listening to your tunes.<br /><br />Power to the headphones is provided by a set of NiMH (size AAA) batteries.  These batteries are in turn recharged by putting the headphones on their transmitter base; said base can be mounted to a wall. The entire system--transmitter base and headphones weigh in at just 8.1 ounces, but the headphones are rather large; large but comfortable.<br /><br />The transmitter can be set to three different channels, while a rotary dial is provided on the headphone to fine tune the pair.  An on/off switch and volume control can also be found on the headphones.<br /><br />Set-up & Use<br /><br />I bought the Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones to use on my computer at work to replace my bulky speakers, but I tested the unit at home first on my home stereo system.  It took me less than five minute to set the system up.  The transmitter base is fitted with two LED's: a yellow On/Off and red Charge lights.  Once the transmitter and plugged into an audio source and detects current the On/Off LED will illuminate.  Once I installed the batteries in the headphones I was ready for wireless listening.<br /><br />In and around my house the sound quality from the Sennheiser RS-120 was outstanding!  I was able to roam throughout the house without experiencing and signal degradation or interference.  Frequency response was suburb, and the overall sound was crisp and enjoyable.  It helps that there is no frequency overlap in my house; i.e. my cordless phone operate at 5.8GHz and my wireless LAN operates at 2.4GHz.  The Sennheiser RS-120 operate on a radio frequency of 926MHz<br /><br />Work is a different story altogether.  The Sennheiser RS-120's still work for the most part but there is some interference from my other wireless accessories, including my cordless keyboard and mouse and cordless Plantronics headset.  I am able to change the channel and fine tune the frequency when needed however, and for the most part I am able to listen to music and or radio interference free.<br /><br />The range inside my standard office building setting is outstanding through doors and walls.  I can roam a considerable distance before static degrades the signal; very impressive.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I like my new Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones, so much so that I am planning on purchasing a set for my home stereo.

R285D81TX1E8YF,3,"The quality of the sound was more than adequate for my needs. I could go 20 feet outside and still have a strong signal. Upstairs or downstairs, they work great. I think they are a great value.  I returned them for one reason only. I prefer a cupped-style earphone and the open-style foam earpiece just didn't cut it. I wear wireless headphones because I am usually walking around or doing some light activity somewhere else in the house. Every time I bent down, the headphones fell off my head. You can't adjust the tension in the headphones, so I couldn't live with that.  Before I sent them back I did some checking and it looks like the earphones I need are at least $100 more than these. I guess I need to re-evaluate my listening needs. Maybe I should just get a pair of lightweight infrared earphones for watching TV and a good corded headset for listening to music."
RAT7C8J0HKSZF,5,"I mostly bought these because the Sony MDR-IF240RK's I bought were incompatible with my Plasma TV (major interference).  Even though the Sennheiser RS120's cost half again what the Sony MDR-IF240RK's cost, they are a much better value.    These work great with my Plasma TV.  They are fairly big, but are generally comfortable (even on a guy with a big head).  The range and line of site on them is excellent.  The charging cradle works well.  The instructions were deficient (but came in a multitude of languages), but it was not that hard to figure out the set up.    I would definitely recommend the Sennheiser RS120's for most people looking at the lower end of the price range.     Pro's (Sennheiser RS120's):  --Price/Value  --Easy set up  --Good sound  --Great range & no line of site issues  --Compatible with Plasma TV  --Fit a big head (7&3/4)    Con's (Sennheiser RS120's):  --Old school dial controls (think old AM clock/radio)  --Occasional (but noticeable) \\""booping\\"" noise"
RV8DGLDEQKBRY,4,"This item is not perfect but it is close enough to recommend. I was impressed by the fact that when I reported what I thought was a problem, I received a reply by phone. Where do you get support like that?"
R3L2X2LPV0UXR9,5,"I have had a problem understanding spoken words on the TV for some time. Turning up the volume just made more noise not better understanding.  I did a little research and read that this product had some good reviews. I ordered this device and was more than happy with the results. Clear sharp sounds, and I can understand all spoken words. It works with the volume muted which is very nice. Buy it."
RUY3KJ2X0HGKL,3,"I got these on sale for $59, and for that price I'd totally recommend them. Overall they're great, but there are a few issues that could easily be deal-breakers if you're not familiar with this type of wireless headphone:    1) Constant hiss. Imagine a radio signal in your car -- that's what's coming to your headphones. The sound is clear and crisp, but there is a noticeable hiss even when the volume isn't that high.    2) Severely susceptible to interference. In my living room there is a constantly repeating click audible through the headphones that isn't coming from any of my other devices. Whrrrr cli-click. Whrrrr cli-click. Whrrrr cli-click. Constantly. Unless you live in a shielded apartment, you'll likely hear something odd.    I've found that by turning my TV way up and turning the headphones way down, I can minimize the audible noise coming through the headphones, but had I known that it'd be this apparent I probably would have sprung for the higher models that are reported to have fewer signal problems.    So, overall: If you want cheap wireless headphones that are good enough, buy these. If you're an audiophile and are easily annoyed by signal degradation, move on up the chain and buy the more expensive models."
R21WHP3TUYX2AC,5,"These headphones are excellent. It took me a little while to find the best channel, but now I can walk around the house in other rooms with no problem. The sound quality is much better than that of my TV set! I have not tested the battery life because I have not used the headphones for more than two hours at a time and then they go back on the charging cradle. They are very comfortable as well."
R39RLSRSANSWYJ,5,"I love it..This is my second one..I have one on the main TV and one on the bedroom TV..They do not interfere with each other..Will be buying one more for the computer..With three channels I will have reached my limit..My wife has bionic hearing and was always complaining that the TV's were to loud..I lost a good portion of my hearing while in combat in VietNam and these headphones have been a real blessing..I have gone through several different kinds of wireless headphones and for me these are the only ones that I could leave on for hours without headaches and pain around the ears..Just the right amount of tension..I have gone to back of my yard (100 feet +-) and across the street without losing reception..For me, the sounds are just great..My only fault is that I had to fasten a color coordinated shoe lace so they will not fall off when leaning forward..Almost lost them in the toilet..My first set I paid 79.99 on sale at Sears and this set I paid 59.00 with free shipping at Amazon...Waiting for another sale.."
RSIBRSFVN8R0H,5,"I've used this product for about 7 weeks and love it.  The sound quality is very good, the fit and ear comfort is great, and the operating range is quite remarkable.  It operates perfectly anywhere in our home from the second floor (where the base unit resides) to the basement. There are absolutely no dead spots or breaks in reception.  The battery charging system works well and, unlike the previous unit I owned, it is unnecessary to remove the batteries from the headset and place them in the base unit for charging.    All in all I think this is a great product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality, no nonsense wireless headphones."
REX9GBP3942A5,3,"If you are looking for a pair of wireless headphones in this price range, these will do.<br /><br />Good:<br />- easy enough to get setup<br />- super easy to charge<br /><br />Bad:<br />- background noise a little excessive at times<br />- sometimes you have to 'recalibrate' the headphone/base unit connections after turning it on and off again<br /><br />Had them a couple days.  Let's see how long they last."
R1JGPH6KMSWJES,5,"There is some noise in the transfer, but overall I'm very pleased with these.  I use them for two reasons.  First, to listen at a comfortable volume while washing dishes (I'm a noisy dishwasher I suppose, but these headphones are much more effective than turning up the overall volume).  Second to be mobile around the house; taking out the trash while listening to tv works well."
RL0Y43CKOAGO8,5,"I was a bit skeptical at first with these considering they came out 6 years ago, but these are some nice wireless headphones. I bought them to keep the house quieter for my baby on the way and they work perfectly. The sound is very crisp and I can now watch TV with the main TV volume turned down all the way. Highly recommend these for anyone wanting to do the same thing."
R35B5BK380A1F,3,"Overall, fairly good headphones. Seems to be some minor episodes of static when I move around the room while listening. I like having a volume control and the ability to fine tune the reception on the headset. Good to very good fidelity. Phones fit a little too loosely for my comfort, tend to flop aroung with quicker than normal head movements, or when you look down. I actually own two sets, one attached to my computer and one attached to my home theater amplifier. You cannot buy just the base unit and use two base units with one headphone. You have to buy two full sets if you want two locations. Be careful when you unplug the connection to a standard size headphone jack as the adapter will separate and leave the plug still inserted in the amplifier."
R3TNUP0ZI9U1SA,5,"I'm using them with my computer.  I'm not an expert, but I think they sound awesome.  Reception is very clear.  Sound is great.  I read some reviews about the controls being in an odd place or too close together. I don't think it's a big deal at all.  I supposed it could be an issue if I was laying down, but I am at a desk.  Charging station is very cool and compact.  I am very happy with these.  I almost went with the RS130's or RS140 but I am glad I save the money and went with these (RS120's)."
R8CGMV7A3YIMJ,5,"I bought this item last Christmas for my husband, and at first he was unsure about it, but after we hooked it up , he has not went a day without using it. Finally i get to sleep at night without the loud Tv waking me up. Sometimes I even find him with the headset on while we are both watching the televison, just because he enjoys the sound so much. Would definetly recommend this to anyone.."
R3V1SKECEJNNLG,2,"When I got these I couldn't figure out what the \\""tune\\"" dial was for - I hadn't seen a device that you had to manually tune since before TV's had remote controls, and I though it was hilarious that there was a very loud hissing sound when there wasn't a signal available, like that stereo I had in high school (which was a very long time ago).  Even then it didn't make sense why they would put the \\""tune\\"" dial under the \\""volume\\"" dial since presumably you only tune it once.  But I figured maybe they were going retro.      Unfortunately they weren't.  In fact these headphones, which in the 1970's probably sounded pretty good, aren't serviceable now because there's so much noise in the 900Mhz spectrum that you constantly get popping and buzzing and other artifacts in the soundstream.  Which is tragic since they sound quite good, the charging system is top notch, the battery life is probably good (I never ran them out so don't know for sure) and they are light and comfortable.    In the end I had to return them.      Dear Sennheiser, invest in a couple of EE's under the age of 50 who have heard of a DSP and do a nice digital version of these and you'll have a great product."
R2DK78MRRT3M2V,2,"These guys are ripping you off with the inflated price because there is no one else in the market to make such a simple device.  This particular model does not even have digital tuning so you always end up moving the tune knob and have to constantly adjust tuning. This is specially because the tuning and volume control knobs are in the back and if you are in your bed, those knobs rub against the pillow and move all the time. I would expect a digital tuning method on a wireless headphone which cost fifty plus bucks. I personally would not recommend these unless they cost less than thirty bucks. They dont even turn off when no signal is received so they end up loosing their charge every day if you want to use them before sleeping.  My headphones started having volume knob static problems only after 1 year. And the head strap broke in the middle. So not very well built."
R38MLZR0XJRHK8,4,"For those complaining about the hiss, there is something you can try which is not mentioned in the documentation that comes with the headphones: Sometimes you hear hiss because the sound going into the transmitter is too low. You need to turn UP the volume at the amp and turn DOWN the volume on the headphones. But you will not be able to do this trick if you plug the transmitter into the phono output from your amplifier. Often the volume on those outputs is fixed and cannot be controlled. It my just be too low for the use of these headphones.    Aside from that, they worked well in terms of range throughout the house.   With so many wireless gadgets in our house, other products have often picked up interference, but these headphones worked perfectly.    Audio quality is good but not jaw-dropping, especially if you already have very good amplifier and speakers for comparison. The unit is a bit heavy and makes your ears hot and will slip off if you bend over. I am sure that they could have made it much lighter without sacrificing the quality.    I like the use of standard NimH AAA rechargeable batteries (and you can use standard alkaline batteries in an emergency - just don't try to charge them on the cradle, the batteries could explode or leak)."
R3DKOAXNJ83L3F,5,"We purchased this headset after reading most of the Amazon reviews for the same. 6  years ago we purchased another brand and the difference between the two was phenominal!  No comparison!!!    Definitely would recommend these, giving them a 2 thumbs up and score of \\""10\\"" all the way.  You will not be disappointed!!!  :>D"
R18Z1D85SCNPE1,4,"Sound quality is very good.  Distance is 300+ feet as posted. Am happy with the purchase, but I would not recommend them for a young person or for someone with a thinner head as the solid top band does not allow for any inward adjustment."
R2CCD3JM5GDD9Q,3,i LOVE these headphone except for one thing... the charger stopped working very shortyly after purchase. i am currently using disposables batteries until i have time to deal with getting them fixed or replaced. they are an amazing pair of headphone otherwise.
R2ZXWKG886PM86,1,"Great phones - when they work. The transmitting unit repeatedly shuts down in the middle of music or TV, even when the source is at adequate volume. Not useable. If the unit is not defective, it needs an auto off bypass switch or sensitivity control. Too bad. Returning - hope it is not recycled to another buyer."
R1OQ5AI8N96PBC,5,"I used to have a Sony headset - this one is much better in terms of sound quality and reach around the room. The construction is such that the ears get a little warm (because I wear it when I work out) but not uncomfortable and the sound is truly remarkable. The build is solid, charging is easy."
R30DQQHBUUITV7,4,"Despite the complaints I noticed in the reviews, this product works just fine.  The reception is crystal clear and with good range.  I do not hear any \\""ringing\\"" or other interference, so I would assume that users who noticed this have other electronic products in use that are responsible for the noise.  The headphones are perfect for doing chores around the house during football season!  I get to listen to the game with great sound and when there's a play I want to see, I can just run to the TV and best of all, no disturbing the rest of the family by blasting the TV throughout the house."
R2B7WTR6IWZGHR,3,"I had a few questions on the item, the questions were answered in an excellant manner."
R145UH9HXLUA9L,5,I've been using Sennheizer products for many years and this product stands up with the quality I've found in all this company's products.  I highly recommend this setup.
R3S5XC5ERYWXC1,5,"i'm up all night and bought these to watch tv without disturbing the people here...  was thinking they probably wouldn't sound too good but should be ok and i could stop waking up the house...  well, these sound soooo good and are sooo comfortable, that i often wear them in the daytime, when i wouldn't be disturbing anyone...  they just sound way better than the tv...  i've wandered approx 70 feet without static...  they're crytal clear!!!  and it's really nice to be able to go into the kitchen, to make a sandwich, during a commercial and not miss anything if i don't get back in time...  they've actually become kinda priceless to me (maybe that's putting it a little too strongly) and they're on sale for cheap!!!"
R2YC5YCWNRJW2,5,I work night shift and sometimes watch tv in bedroom when wife is asleep. This unit while not perfect is close enough for my purposes.
R2NACNVIHFW584,5,"This is an amazing headset for those who have trouble hearing the television.  I purchased these for my mother who had to have her tv on volume 35 to hear it.  With these, she has the volume on 14, which is comfortable for all of us!  The sound is clear and not at all muffled. They are not heavy or awkward to wear."
RFH3TSPDMCOVG,4,"I haven't had any problems with these headphones and have no complaints. I had a Sennheiser set before this set that stopped working after a year or so. I wasn't particularly pleased about that but got this set at a good price so gave them another try. So far, so good."
R3KVIX4RNEG4J8,4,"I bought these for my wife,she is very happy with them.she listens to the radio while working on the computer.you can change frequencies to adjust for local interferance.They have a very good range of distance.Overall a very good buy."
RPIRJHF411CGY,4,The good part:  The sound is very good. The range is very good.I wore these headphones to my mailbox which is about 325 feet and the sound never faded.  The bad part:  The ear peices are not cupped. They are flat and after about a hour they begin to hurt your ears. I have a big head and I have trouble keeping the phones on my head as they get very loose.
R3I6LB37C6QX3O,5,I can now listen to tv without blasting everyone out of the room. Clarity is exceptional.
R2Z9Y93RKZD30,5,"Ordered this to use with a treadmill. Works great. Very easy to set up and figure out. Would not hesitate to purchase. In fact, I am going to order another for the bedroom so as not to disturb my spouse. Hope they don't interfere with each other!?"
R30QLWB162KE4J,4,"I bought this so I could watch T.V. while my husband is studying, computer and T.V. are in same room and he needs quiet to study. I had the tv ears before that and they were terrible! This product is much higher quality as far as sound and works great for me to watch/listen to tv while he studies undisturbed. However, it isn't that comfortable to me. The headphones just don't adjust enough for me to get a comfortable fit so they slid around if I move my head to much, and I wish they were lighter. But, other than the comfort factor they are great and do exactly what they were advertised to do. I also like how easy they fit on the charger and are always ready to go as long as you put them back to charge when done. Very easy set up too although the directions are a bit slim, but it's pretty easy to figure out what to do and get them set up."
RE91PMV4IH6FV,2,"I paid and received a dead eraphphone on 9/21/2010, I then ship it back for an exchangeaccording to the procedure on 10/7/2010. So far, I have received nothing yet ! What a poor service !"
R2FUYXCCGLPJ1X,4,"Great sounding headphones with a comfortable fit. The range of operation is fine with minimal buzz or interference. I can't speak to the longevity of the headphones but I can tell you that you will need to replace, at once, the batteries that are supplied. Even after initially charging the recommended 12+ hours we could not get more than 2-3 hours of operation before recharging was required. The standard rechargable batteries we installed last at least 10-12 hours per charge. It would be nice if decent batteries were provided but our research indicated that this was going to be an issue."
RRDNBMKT3XBKK,2,"These headphones are really great, when they are working. They charge and hold that charge for a long time, but they are very prone to inference and changing the channel only helps temporarily. I was very disappointed in these headphones and would not recommend them."
R18ZF665LVB9D1,4,"I am a bit hard of hearing LOL.    This happens as we get older.   My husband is still working and needs to get up quite early in the morning.   Because I am a night owl I watch TV while I'm knitting or crocheting for charity.   Even through a bedroom door and down a hallway, he could still hear the TV because I had the volume turned up so loud.    That's all changed since I purchased this product.    I can put the TV on a very low setting or even turn it to mute and they still work.  I can walk all over the entire house and have perfect hearing for whatever program/movie I'm watching.    My only complaint is that I can't seem to adjust these to fit my head - so - I can't bend my head down without holding on to the headphones else they would slip off.  Either I have a small head or the headphones are made for the guys.    HMMM   that could be."
R39PZVMBD49YW1,5,"I have went thru 2 different cheap brands, in the past 5 years, I use them when my husband sleeps at all different times. I can even walk around the house down the basement with no change in sound, they are better sounding, dont crack and NO buzzing or white noise with these, My life is better becasue of them."
R39H0OAOF9EBV6,2,"I followed the instructions to charge before use, etc. I then tried using all three channels to tune the sets to eliminate the hum/buss in the background. While settling for ok/poor quality sound, the headsets dropped the signal and inserted a very loud static noise level in my ears. So loud it hurt. I then returned to headsets to try another brand. It may have been more than one issue but I don't have time to test and return. The set I have now are great. Try tma's."
RUW2V82JJE3TR,3,"These headphones are excellent in some respects. The charging system is terrific, the battery life is excellent, and they are very comfortable. That being said the audio quality is awful. And the programming going on in these headphones is simply atrocious.     I imagined that there would be some static, as there is with most wireless devices, and that with some careful fiddling I could make it disappear; this is not the case. There is literally always audible white noise being pumped into my ears when I use these. It's not entirely intolerable, but the fact of the matter is that it will never go away.    The other major issue I have with these phones is the apparent \\""automatic volume adjustment\\"". Although not mentioned in the advertisement you'll notice if you turn up the volume on your audio device the volume will not change in your headphones. When tuning these headphones you're either on the channel or not. There is no middle ground, no \\""fine tuning\\"". It seems good on paper, no hassle, easy to tune in to the appropriate wireless channel. However, in practice this just makes the phones automatically \\""enhance\\"" the static they already produce and effectively prevent you from ever being able to fix the problem. The control is taken away from the user and entrusted to a poorly designed computer.     My final issue is that if you don't provide any sort of audio input for ~3 minutes the transmitter shuts off and the headphones Blast static at whatever volume it should of been at before the programmed volume adjustment. This is really fun if you've left them on your head.    Also, It sounds like I've blown out my speakers whenever I try to play loud bass. I don't believe they are blown out, but there is a distinct rattle. I don't recommend these if you like to listen to loud music, you will be disappointed.     I truly believe this would be an excellent product if they simply let me do all the volume adjustments and tuning manually."
R2IF5QWTLRZ2C0,4,"Overall, this is a great product.  It is comfortable, has a great range, and very good sound.  The reviews about losing signal in a few songs is true - about 1 of 100 songs the range of the song is too quiet and low and it simply goes to static.  Also, the further you are from the source, the more likely you are to get a low hiss.  But the value is incomparable."
R1UUZL0L794U2K,4,Surprisingly good.  The only criticism is that the headphones keep the area surrounding the ears fairly warm.    The price was quite affordable.
R2XRHMRON9XJGC,2,"I really only have one complaint about these headphones. The sound quality is good, the comfort is good - I wear them 8 hours each day, and the charge always lasts the entire day.    My problem is that I listen to music with a lot of dynamic range, which wreaks havoc with the dynamic audio leveling. For example, during a quiet part of a song, there may be a sudden crescendo, which is immediately clamped down to the level of the quiet section, and continues so for several seconds while attenuating to the new level.    While this might not matter for some music or listening habits, this is not for music with any dynamics.     I should have researched the product a little more closely. Now, I'm on the quest of another set of headphones that sound good and will not get tangled under the legs of my chair."
R3KFJBI5MFK9DY,4,"These headphones are amazing!  I had been looking for lightweight, wireless headphones for years - I even bought a couple that were either very heavy or just didn't work.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, these headphones work best when you turn off your tv's speakers and adjust the volume on the tv and headphones; I encounter major static when I don't do this (this is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). Otherwise, they are perfect and, on my recommendation, my brother - who demands perfection - also bought them and also loves them.<br /><br />Good job, Sennheiser!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I have been using these headphones for more than two years now and they still work as good as new (and I use them almost every day).  Love them!!!"
R17UHDRIC6KRSS,5,"I bought this product becuase I had a need. I needed to be able to listen and watch TV & DVD/Bluerays without disturbing anybody in the house, while they were either reading, sleeping. This product is perfect, I have had it for a few months now and I love it, and use it all the time. It does exactly what it says and its awesome quality. The sound comes through clear and crisp and I love it!"
R15W0LY9ONY1CV,2,"If not for the automatic on-off, this would have been a good purchase. Unfortunately, this feature does annoy you if every ten minutes the unit turns off and then you hear a loud static sound! Frustrating! I ended up watching the program on TV without using the unit. Angry stare from wife? or damaging my ear drum?...lesser evil - chose angry stare from wifey."
R1SKRG10DEQGJD,4,"Pros - indeed a wireless headphone that is not heavy, nor difficult to use  Cons - disconnects after a while, making a very loud hissing noise when the signal is paused.  Sound is not crystal clear, but good enough for movies and gaming.  I have not tried it for music yet. The headphones are light (could be lighter and smaller though), but do not provide a firm fit at all, on the other hand, that allows me to use gaming phones as well, at the same time... I did not like the two in one jack, as it tends to slip when plugged to the TV and sometimes I get signal in just one of the sides, due to that.  This is probably an \\""entry level\\"" product and I bought it with very low expectations and maybe that is why I am not disappointed, nor unhappy with this purchase. I also use it in front of the TV and have not tested its range.  It does however, pick up some interference and, a good thing you may switch reception channels.  I recommend it for gamers."
R35LXLORHDVQVH,4,"I bought this headset to replace an RCA headset that was several years old.  The RCA had cupped headphones, that stay in place very well, though they lacked the excellent sound quality and positive charging of the Sennheiser.  The sound quality of the Sennheiser is simply wonderful.  Their method of direct charging, which includes a light telling when the unit is charging, is far superior to the RCA's induction charging method.  On the other hand, the range is not as far reaching as the 120 feet advertised, it is more like 35 feet.  The greatest difficulty with this headset is how easily it falls off my head.  Even leaning forward to get up from a chair requires a hand to hold them in place.  Adjusting the headband doesn't help.  One of the main reasons for buying such a headset is to allow mobility.  These are not convenient in this regard at all.  If all you plan to do is listen to your TV while sitting very still, these are great, but don't plan on moving around with ease."
R3GRHQKWKPYS71,5,"Headset is awsome. Sound quality is great, fit great, and the abilty to charge them on the stand without having to hook up and disconnect cables everytime you want to charge them is a great design."
R3EAGG5MCN06ZU,5,I have been extremely well pleased with the headphones. The reception is excellent and I especially like the fact that I can wonder around the house and continue to listen to my TV program. The only drawback I have found is that the headphones do not fit real snuggly and they fall off my head when I bend over. I also like the recharging cradle that the headphones are stored on when not in use.
R2NXYIIVUWPF4H,5,"I agree with the good reviews but have somethings to add.    Documentation was worse than terrible. at least for neophytes like me. I think all I really knew to do from the documentation was to install batteries in the headset and charge.    Thank goodness for the web because at first, all I got was a whole lot of static.  Turns out because my TV is connected via HDMI to my Tivo box, my only option (that I know of that works) is to connect the sennheiser to my Tivo box, not to my TV (even though there were definitely appropriate audio plugs on my samsung hdtv).      Once I removed cablesfrom the TV and reconnected cables to the Tivo audio ports - things worked great with no other installation problems other than to do some tuning and volume control. I used the red and black connectors from the cable supplied in the sennheiser box, things worked amazingly well.    I like that whoever is wearing the headsets, all they need to do is turn down the audio on the tv using standard procedures. Results is that others in the room without the headset don't hear the tv but if the wearer of the headset adjusts the volume on the headset itself, they can hear everything very well.  If I'm on my computer 6 or 8 ft away, I can't hear a thing.    Most importantly, they don't need to be plugging and replugging the headset.    Though because of the connection directly to the TIVO, this means that if we ever get a DVD player, we will need to disconnect sennheiser from TIVO and connect to the DVD player.  It seems the sennheiser for it to be functional needs to be able to be plugged into whatever box has the \\""active\\"" or \\""in use\\"" HDMI connection to the TV."
R2GPXGUBIWPF6A,2,The workmanship is shoddy.  There is a loose wire so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn not.  Inadequate accompanying material to describe product and its use. Sound quality average when it works.
R17UN2GWTCVAC8,5,"have had two other earphones needed for my lousy hearing from flying 14000 hours in prop, turboprop and jet jobs.  These German desgined RS 120  the 926 MHz phones are used about 30 feet from the TV in another room and work perfectly.  For the price you have a good deal.  Loud and clear and fit comfortably.  frank b."
R74AWDGKA0KBL,3,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    The sound is excellent for the price.  However, these headphones do not have an adjustment for width and keep falling off while trying to recline and watch tv.  There is no adjustment that allows the user to make them fit more snuggly.  Additionally, the way the Amazon product info is provided for this item, it shows two associated cables that are ordered with it making the customer believe that they may also be needed for it to work properly!!  This is not the case. Everything needed comes with the headphones themselves.  I will be looking for something to replace them as soon as I can afford it. I hate having to constantly adjust this set because it keeps slipping off.  Highly recommended if you have a very wide head!!"
R1QEXUDAVBG8JT,5,I had Sony IR wireless headphones.  It used to break the audio when ever someone walks between the headphones and base.  This one works like a gem.  No audio loss and audio goes through walls.  Battery works great.  Headphones are lightweight and comfortable.    I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for good wireless headphones within small budget.  5 star.
R3JFRJS9CIWGDW,5,I received these headphones promptly and replaced my old wired headset.  Very straightforward and easy set up with no worries headset recharging.  Headphones are always ready to use. Just plug the headphone charging cradle into the stereo receiver headphone output jack and turn the headset on.  Highly recommended.
R2DSDBLNYM87TT,5,"I've just received these headphones and I have to say they are really great. The headphones themselves are very light weight, so I can watch TV or listen to music for hours in complete comfort. Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't hear any hiss or other noise from them. I've been able to get quite a long way from the base & still receive everything perfectly.  I have tried other brands & didn't find any that could compare for the price. I'm sure the higher priced sets from this company will be even better."
R1QFUUFF7F2FI3,4,"I wanted to buy this headphones for my husband is a huge Sony fan, but after reading some bad reviews about the Sony headphones, I took a risk and tried this brand for the first time. I don't regret it! He loves it and me too. They are very comfortable, great sound reception, excellent sound quality, very easy of recharging. Will definitely buy again!"
R2MOCF4NO2PXBZ,4,"This is my first set of wireless headphones and unlike Sennheiser's corded over the ear and their earbuds, these hardly have any bass. As rated, their reception, volume, comfort, are all great. Sound quality I would say is just good. I've had these headphones for about 2 years now and only use them about once a week when I'm vacuuming and cleaning the house. These do a pretty good job of drowning out the vacuum and I never have interference issues. I've never had the batteries die on me and use them for about an hour or two at a time, then recharge."
R100TAMS0PVK3Z,4,"The only drawback to these headphones would be the tuning, you have to \\""tune\\"" them in much like a radio; if they had 'locked on tuning', they would be the best headphones around.  Everything else about them is fantastic."
R18JJIKQT4IEV7,3,It sound verily well maybe A little static and fits well works good in other rooms and very easy to charge .
R3MYYDYQ08V57S,4,"The headphone set was pretty easy to set up, and once I got the right tuning (it's a wheel on one earpiece, just like on a radio) it worked just fine. I use it to watch TV while running without having to blast the volume. When I took the dogs out during a commercial break, I left the headphones on, and the sound was still clear even outside my house. I always turn the headset off and put it back on the charger after each run, so I haven't put battery life to the test.    One thing that may become an issue for me but is specific to my use: Because I'm working out while wearing the headset, I do get some sweat on the foam earpads. Over time that will probably degrade the foam; I'll likely need to look into whether I can get replacement pads.    Overall, I'm very pleased."
R97D9CD2AURWW,4,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Headphones to listen to various videos, news and clips on my Macintosh computer without being aggravated by a wire connection or of annoying others with the sound,  and I am very satisfied with the high quality job it has done on this.  But there is another way I did not expect that these headphones have given me pleasure.  I can listen to the audio from all the different  programs on the computer all over the house and even for a short distance outside.  This include sportscasts, iTunes music and the many radio stations listed on iTunes.  Now I can go to the mailbox across the street, go get or refill food or drink or leave the computer for brief periods for other reasons without missing an audio beat."
R3TEQIV7X1L5KY,4,"My last wireless headphones were Sennheiser RS-130. The over the head plastic started cracking so I knew it was time to replace them. I remember shopping around before buying the RS-130's and found Sennheiser way ahead of the competition on frequency response, range, quality, and easy of use. I found the RS-120's and decided to give them a try since the RS-130's were much more expensive.     PROS :    1. Reasonably priced.    2. Great wireless range. Held signal through underground parking garage       from a 3rd floor apartment. Held signal is different than full fidelity      but 85% of fidelity at that range with obstacles is impressive!    3. Lighter weight headset than RS-130.    4. Good wireless channel fine tuning.    CONS :    1. Have to switch channels at base on RS-120 versus on headset on RS-130.    2. Less bass range than RS-130.    3. Ears are not covered by earpieces making it easier to have headphones fall off       when bending over to pick things up. Also requires slightly higher volume to       cover up other noises from the outside.      A small bit of bass loss is worth the lower price tag. I'm amazed at the wireless range.      I like the sound quality of the RS-120 which does lack some of the bass of the RS-130's. The RS-130's had surround sound which isn't on the RS-120's but I don't think surround sound is critical for my use, which is listening to TV when out of the room.       The fit of the headphones is different between the RS-130's and the RS-120's.     The RS-130's ear pieces actually fit over the ear surrounding it. Perhaps this, or the surround sound, resulted in the RS-130's have better bass. I believe the frequency spec on the RS-130 actually went down to 20Hz. I didn't check the RS-120 spec but am sure, from use, that it is slightly higher.    The RS-130's wrapped over the head slightly better than the RS-120 allowing for more looking down range without the headphones starting to slide off of the head. The RS-130's were slightlyheavier which makes the RS-120's more comfortable when moving the head around or wearing for longer periods of time.      All in all I'm very happy with the RS-120's."
R22Y3JDLYWQCZM,4,"Hello, I'll keep it simple. I got this product because my girlfriend goes to sleep at 9pm and I can't go to sleep w/o a late night dose of cartoons or history channel.    First the good. I really needed something I could just turn on and go and that is exactly what I got and more. The device cradle pluged so quickly into my TV; I turned on the headphones and boom!...I'm listening my cartoons at midnight like it's noon! The sound quality is crisp as loud as you can handle . You might have to play a bit w/ the dials to tune into the best signal, but that is really easly done from the headphoes themselves. It is conmfortable on my ears and does not make my ears sweat at all. I tried them walking around the house and even went to my back yard to try them and the work! I haven't run out of battery yet, but I always put it back on the cradle when I get up in the morning, so I haven't tested that continuously. Maybe someone else can comment on that.    Now the bad. My only complain is the size and its weight. The headphones are too big so as I lean on my pillow or the headboard, the headphones are pushed off my hears, so I can't really get too relax and fall asleep waring them. Also, they do not hang onto my head that tight and there is no adjustable feature so with its weight, I have to keep adjusting them evey so often. If you have a small to medium size head, they might be a little hard to keep on.    Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who with similar needs, considering its drawbacks."
R19EV8C4GGMT78,3,I live in the city & there is massive interference. VERRY loud interference. ALL the time. I have a place in the country. I will try it there.
R222HZM27ZGAXP,5,"My wife likes to watch TV in bed after I've fallen asleep and these Wireless Headphones were just what the doctor ordered. They sound great, are comfortable and if you're TV or receiver are across the room, no need to worry about a cord reaching. As a test I wore them outside to mow the lawn...not only was the reception very good, they also helped drown out the sound of the mower.    For the price I don't think these can be beat!"
R2INIXTA1KGXDR,1,"I love the idea of these headphones.  And when they have worked, I have been happy with them.  The acoustic quality of our media area is not great so my wife really likes how they make it easier to hear and underatand movies.  I am reasonably happy with sound quality.<br /><br />My problem with them is reliability. The first set I received was deader than a wedge right out of the box.  I sent those back and received a replacement set.  It worked immediately.  We have used this set perhaps a dozen times in the approximately two months we have had them.  Now this set is dying, working only intermittently.<br /><br />I am not impressed with the quality control of these units.....the failure rate of those delivered to me has been 100%.  I cannot recommend them."
RDIFYZ8D8AAIJ,4,"The RS120's are exactly as advertised. Setup is easy as can be, as is charging. Just set them on the cradle. It's kind of a drag to have to fine tune the reception, but once you dial it in, the audio is clear and static-free (sitting about 10-12 ft from the unit). It fades out a bit when I get up and go to the kitchen with them on, but is still clear and keeps me in touch with what's going on.     Audio quality is what it is. Do not expect high-end headphone quality. Period. Do not expect sub-woofer lows. Do expect to get everything you need from sports, news, sitcoms, etc. without anyone else in the house or even the same room hearing it. My bedroom opens up over the living room and my wife often goes to bed an hour or two earlier than I do. I can watch the whole second half of a game without bothering her a bit - as long as I keep my outbursts to a minimum."
R3UGE170J7WNB1,4,"OK.    So, I got these so that I could listen to the tv while my son is busy online chatting on his headset with out the inevitable volume war ensuing.    Now to the headphones, they work and they sound pretty darn good. If you are a hardcore audiophile, these will probably not satisfy your needs. But, if your needs are a little more basic, these would be a good choice.    The directions are poor, to say the least. Rather than try and put information in 9 different languages they would do much better to do large diagrams. I spent 30 min trying to tune this thing by switching channels, turning the tuning dial, trying different RCA sockets. Do yourself a favor, if you have an audio jack on your tv, use it. If you do not, tune your headset first by using the included RCA/audio jack adapter using your iPod, MP3, or CD player. Once your headset is properly tuned, then try the RCA plugs in each audio out until you find the proper one.     After that, then you can tweek the fine tuning to where you like it.    I don't know yet about battery life or how dependable they are, so I will update my rating when I have any info on that."
R17VUXUJCH6MID,5,"I like this headset.  I didn't even notice at first that these are on-the-ear rather than around-the-ear.  Very comfortable.  The sound is excellent.      I thought the last set I had was RF because it mentioned 23MHz prominently in the verbiage, but it was in fact infrared.  I really like being able to remember I need to take the garbage out and still being able to hear the newscast I'm watching.  I'll never have a line-of-site headset again.    The charging cradle works great.  I did make the mistake of buying the connection adapter that was recommended as \\""often bought with\\"".  In fact it came with one, and I didn't even need that one.  The native connectors are the 1/4\\"" RCA type that are the normal TV audio connection, and if you want to plug it into an MP3 player, computer, or something like that the adapter from RCA jacks to a 3.5mm mini plug is included.    If I were to criticize anything, I might suggest that the controls be moved slightly.  The volume and tuning controls are on the rear side of the right headphone.  When I lean back in my recliner and if my head presses into the headrest just right, it will occasionally readjust the volume for me.  But that's a nit.      I like this headset."
RW5C4ES4AUXSY,3,la verdad esque este equipo se ve interesante y los es pero la verdad lo que las personas buscan en este tipo de aparato es el sonido.    es pecimo se puede decir que igual al que compras en la tienda de un chino sin discriminar la calidad de sonido terrible pero facil de cargar esta interesantisimo pero el sonido terrible   [[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]  los uso pero quiero comprar otros que tengan buen sonido
R24V3B4RV5CY86,5,"Bought for my aunt specifically for her tv in the nursing home.  She likes to fall asleep listening to the tv.  Using these headphones at night with her deafness means she is not disturbing the other residents.  She finds them very comfortable and loves that charging them is easy for her. The first set we had were uncomfortable, and she went through batteries like crazy.  She also had to take the batteries in and out, which is not easy with artheritis.  We recommend them highly."
R1Q6A7LXPOMFH0,5,"This is the second set of Sennheiser RS120  and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Both my wife and I wear hearing aids, but still have some problems hearing the television, but can hear everything perfectly.    We had an older set of wireless headphones that required being plugged into headphone jack which then caused the sound of the TV to be muted.  These headphones can be plugged into the regular audio  output so that we can watch something like a football game with others and everyone can hear.    The headphones can pick up sound anywhere in the house and even outside.  My wife can listen to music while working in the yard.  Our older wireless set, tended to lose sound periodically as you moved about."
R169UPF3J9U45W,5,"THE GOOD:  1. Started using the headphones without reading the user manual (very easy to use)  2. Wireless reception works without any audible problems (I tested up to 25 feet)  3. Large ear pads (very comfortable)  4. Very good sound reproduction (highs are clear, lows are deep)    THE BAD:  1. Earphone uses analog control, similar to FM radio control (hard to lock on the exact frequency)  2. Slight but constant hissing (maybe normal to all wireless headphones?)    If I have to sum up in one word about whether this is a BUY or NO BUY. It is definitely a BUY! Minor flaws but still a great wireless phone."
R23O1Q75FVEJ8Y,5,"I have owned this system for almost a year now.  I must say that I love everything about them.  I have never had the batteries die, even after multiple hours of use.  The sound quality is great.  I use them for gaming online more than anything which is great because I play when the family is asleep.  All in all, great product and a good price."
R13M10CXBZ5P7H,4,This is a great product.  The sound quality is great and it is well worth the money.  My only criticism is that I wish it automatically muted the TV when the headphones are in use.
R3V1HP1JOUU1EY,1,"10-6-2010 Update    Well these just died so they are going back to Amazon. They worked great for about 3 days then I came into work this morning and the power was off on the base unit. I tried changing surge protectors, etc. but I guess the power supply in the base died or shorted out. Bummer - not bad wireless can for the $$. I never completely got rid of the static and interference so I will probably not order a new set.  I loved the wireless aspect, but I was not expecting to hear a lot of analog hiss and occasional buzzing.    Anyone know of a pair that doesn't have these issues?    ----  These are my first ever wireless headphones. I ordered these for my home AV system but tried them out at work on my laptop listening to my iTunes library. I was so impressed I am considering keeping them at work and buying a second pair for home. Setup is dead simple, unpack it, plug in the power and plug in the audio cables to whatever source you want to listen to.    Included is a dual rca to mini jack, very handy - this allows you to plug them into just about any device from a full AV system to a laptop or ipod. Charging is a breeze, you set them on the base, allowing the metal contacts to touch and a light comes on telling you they are charging. How cool is that? Now I can reduce the wires and clutter on my desk and I can use these on my laptop or iphone at work. Sound quality seems very good. I compared them to my tried and true Grado SR60's and dang it if they don't sound almost or just as good. Consider that cost about that same that's pretty fantastic.     Only downside is occasional static pops. I have the base 3 feet away so it can't be a range issue. I will continue to adjust the tuning and see. So far the drops & static aren't enough to worry about. I had to play with the channels and tuning a little bit, the headphones were freaking out every time some called the phone here at the office - weird.    A note to classical music fans, these are basically analog headphones - so there is some background \\""hiss\\"" or noise - you will never notice it with the average pop, rock, jazz tune but with some classical music that have very quiet, subtle passages, you will hear a little ssssssss in the background using these. I was able to turn down the volume on the cans and minimize it mostly. Just a note. At first I was really put off by this but I think it's manageable."
R3CJSSTKENO8KS,4,"I just timed the auto turn off function, it doesn't kick in until it reached 3 minutes of idle time...    For the reviewers complaining about the auto turn off:  If your gonna do something thats gonna take longer than 3 minutes, pause whatever you're listening to and turn off your headphones. When you're done doing what you have to do, turn what ever your listening to into play and turn your headphones back on.    This product is real cheap for a wireless headphones with great range. really worth the money"
R2ZOOJ2XA62QAL,5,Excellent sound quality. The self-charging feature when stored is very handy. It fits very comfortably and is an excellent product for the price. I have had it for over 5 years and have bought 3 more of these as gifts and for other rooms. The durability is amazing and the sound quality is still great.
R2ITB7635T1UDY,4,"Easy to hook up, does not interfere with my wireless system.  Very good sound.  Not tight over my head. I ordered another one!"
R2ZEDJDNSB4QST,4,"Headphones are really good with exceptional range and no static unlike the sony ones which are more expensive and have lot of static. The only thing I did not like was the placement of volume and tuning buttons. They are far too near. Also, if you wear them for more than 2 hours, your head starts to ache. Overall, very good product."
R1NGKHV0PYDG29,4,"Fairly good sound,fit somewhat comfortable,good distance,& really nice feature that allows headphones to start charging as soon as there placed on the holding cradle.       However, I would not pay full price for these headphones. I've seen & owned better for same price. I bought these because I had a money off coupon that was good only for Amazon.com so, thought I would give them a try.Bad features are,no tuner dial on transmitter,not as comfortable on ears as my old ones,and sound quality not as good.My old ones are RCA, purchased at Radio Shack, & within a few dollars of being the same price ,but, with my $20.00 discount I can at least be 70% satisfied & continue using.                                                       ahso@verizon.net"
RBUL5UY0C5DLZ,5,"I've had this headset for a couple of years and it still works great.  It was easy to set up and quick to learn how to use it.  Although I live alone, I like to use these so I can still hear the TV when I'm doing other things around the house.  I don't have to be glued to the couch anymore!  The sound quality is very clear and I've gone from my down stairs to my upstairs and still have been able to hear the TV without static. I've also used this headset when I'm sitting in front of the TV but the sound is not clear.  With this headset, I can hear everything clearly.  The charge seems to last a long time, but I have not timed it.  The price has gone down since I first got mine and I am considering purchasing the same set so I have one for each TV.  Really love this!"
RJ0UPYQ716DQY,4,Great value for the price. Works very well. I can walk two rooms away & still hear everything.
RJE8S60TI7KN4,4,"I have had the headphones for about a month.  The sound quality is great and you can go to  any room in the house or into the yard and still receive good quality sound.  Slight problem  with the headphones staying in place when you bend forward.  I purchased these for my wife  who has a hearing impairment.  Biggest test is going to be longevity; had two previous sets  \\""TV Ears\\"" and neither lasted more than a couple months - junk."
R5C0N485RUPC5,5,"The head set is the best!  My mom who has hearing issues, uses the headphones to enjoy TV.  She can walk all over her home and hear as if she is sitting next to the TV.  We tried other brands and there was always static and she could not leave the room.      I believe the Sennheiser Company should be marketing this product through AARP publications to senior citizens as the need is so great for this type of product with this level of quality.      Many of my mom's friends have tried her headphones and bought their own.  This product has added to the quality of life she is able to enjoy.  A+."
R2NGIRTUUP6EZQ,5,"Previously owned Sony wireless headphones.  I had 2 pairs that snapped just above the earpiece. Thought I would try a more expensive pair and I am very pleased. I wish the on-off control worked like the sony and would turn on when you placed them on your head. Sony's sound is line of sight, so if you move around the room you can lose the sound -- not so with the Sennheiser. Overall, well worth the extra $."
R2W1RKTMOHZ6AV,5,I am very happy to use these wireless headphones. I use them with my work desktop. Their performance is great. Very comfortable fit in the ears. Awesome sound!!  Very convenient to use. Totally recommend them for anyone.
R285LH8GU9CR8Q,4,Bought these headphones for watching TV while not disturbing anyone else.  They work great.  Have good sound and tone to them.  Headset itself could fit a bit better but overall I have been using them for 6 months now and love them. Would recommend to friends.
RQ5LJN8SNJEMG,2,These headphones are very uncomfortable. The ear cuffs are very hard and hurt my ears after about fifteen minutes of usage. The headphones actually work well and have decent reception to about thirty feet away from the base. The tuning buttion is too easy to touch and move when you are trying to change the volume.
R1J7SRMG4C7UU0,4,"I use them in bed so I can watch TV while I fall asleep. This is my second set, first set if this brand. They are not bad for the money. Sometimes I get a click sound in them. The dials are a little out dated, my last set found the frequency automatically but they also cost more. The charging system is really nice, better then my last set. You just set them on the metal rack on top and recharge automatically. The batteries hold a charge great. The headphones are still playing when I wake up in the morning. Hope this helps the bed wearing customer like me, I didn't see a review for \\""us\\""."
R2MX4AXRRBMNME,2,Hard time getting both channels (L&R) equal in the headset
RMDD7CKWMVHZJ,4,"After reading other reviews and the product info, these headphones live up to their claim.  We have the same problem as many couples, my wife wanted the TV loud and I couldn't stand it that loud.  This really has made the experience of watching TV a lot better.  I can have the volume lower where I like it and she's enjoying her own world with the headphones.  If I'm reading or on the computer I can even turn the TV volume off and she can have it any level she wants.  I've enjoyed using them too, great for movies with special effects.  I can't compare these to other brands but will tell you they are heads above the 'TV Ears'. I give them a thumbs up."
R6TDH6D6MN73C,5,Bought this for my 30 something hubby to use while we're in bed at night.  Hes a night owl.  I.Am.Not.  This works out great!  He even prefers to have these on as the sound quality is so much better than what comes from the TV.  Hes a big nascar fan and loves that he can now hear all the subtle engine noises he was missing before.
RUJUYMI06IRXI,5,"I now have my headphones for over a month and couldn't be happier .Even better is the fact that my wife and daughter love me again and are even happier about my purchase than I am. After reading all the reviews I decided to take a chance and order, glad I did.They were easy to set up ,I throw them back on the stand after shutting them off and they are charged the next day for another 7 hours of TV.Left ear for on/off,right ear upper for volume and lower for tuning the phones but once done that's it.My biggest complaint is the fact that they do fall off without to much provocation so if I move I hold on to them.Overall I would still recommend them to anyone looking for great headphones at a reasonable price."
R1CRQS41HC4AA8,5,Was not sure what to expect in this price level of wireless headphones but these exceeded my expectations! Easy to use & charge -great sound quality & my wife said I don't have to move my TV to the garage now!
R1KE3LPHRWTL5Z,1,"I bought these because I currently own another pair of Sennheiser headphones and they sound great.  This item was a real disappointment.  The power cord did not attach properly and would turn on and off with the slightest jiggle.  When I could get them to work, the sound was too much like listening to FM radio station from too far away.  All in all, really poor quality.  I sent it back as soon as I could."
R19D4C6LA932FE,1,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    Product works very good (when working) but constantly keeps shutting down. the time varies. Sometimes 5 minutes, 10 minutes and maybe even 30 minutes.  Then it just cuts out and all you hear is noise with no sound at all.  I thought that at this $90 price you would get a dependable product.  Like they say; you get what you pay for.  But not in this case."
R1XHWZ1ONJZJSV,5,"These worked exactly as advertised. Great reception throughout the house and in the back yard although they are used primarily at night to provide peace in the house. The head phones are very comfortable, they tend to fall off when I am bending over while working but I probably shouldn't expect that much from them. They are great for their intended use. Easy to recharge and very long battery life. They are OK for music, they are great for TV."
R1KF0STG8KUIA0,4,"These headphones are for my mother.  Everything is great except the caretakers don't always put the headphones on the metal to metal so the charger is on.  I have put signs there and they don't read them.  It is frustrating, but we are doing our best. My mother has dementia and can't tell them either."
R3F27LR4QWB8H3,5,"No complaints.  Had some hiss and interference at first but moved the base away from the tv and it's pretty much chrystal clear.  Comfortable, nothing easier than to just hang them on the charger and go.  We'll see about durability as I've only had them a couple months.  So far so good."
REFS30BCS12N5,5,I did my research before making this purchase.  I was going to go for a less expensive pair but I changed my mind thanks to the positive review.  I have had no regrets whatsoever.  These headphones are excellent.  It was very easy to set up and connect to my tv.  The sound quality is tops.  The range is great.  I can be in the kitchen while listening to the tv in the bedroom.  I wish the Tune & Volume controls were in a different location but that is a very minor issue.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.
R1DGJ3B95UUG7T,4,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FTVEK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title  Nothing is perfect but these wireless headphones are approaching it; as far as portability,soundability and hookup ability.  I would recommend them. I have had other person's conversations come over them, as we might expect as we go wireless. No they were not aliens.  Warning: others may be listening to your personal conversations, while using wireless systems."
R2DVUXD90MNTZK,4,"I bought this on Amazon a few months ago. I waited to see how it would perform. It has really helped with living in an apartment. I can watch my movies at night on the weekends while the baby & the mum sleep soundly. I bought this as a gift for my wife (yeah, I use it, but she's the one that sleeps in peace!). Only time she complains is when I am watching a football game and I yell TOUCHDOWN!!! out of the blue and wake everyone up }:-(<br /><br />Only issue I have with it is a hissing sound that erupts sometimes and no matter what, there's no getting rid of it It could be radio interference with other wireless stuff in the house that might be on at that time. I'm not totally sure though."
R2M1H2587ZHEUI,2,"I'll make it short. This is an awful pair of wireless headphones ever. Here's why:    Static Noise - I hear the hiss sound all the times, yes that hiss out-of-band sound when you tune your FM radio. Although it's faint, it's quite noticeable and annoying. When I move or even just moving arms up/down, the noises get louder to compete with the music.    Short Range - 120ft? I walked 10 feet away, and already the sound degrades so much, and to compound the issue, radio noises get louder as I get farther until all I could hear is loud static.    Two stars as it's at least wireless. There's no tangling wire to limit me from moving although moving would produce hiss sound.    If I could turn back the time, I would get a digital wireless headphones instead. It may be better at handling the signals and the hiss and noise could go away."
RN21RYPN4VBW5,4,"This is just a short note, mainly to comment on the Sennheiser Customer Service.  I bought this in May, it worked for a while, then I had some problems with it (read below, though).  It had been a few months before I even had the problem, so it would have been past the initial return period.  I contacted Amazon online, and had some contact with the online middleman company.  However, I really just wanted an answer or a lead as to what the problem was, and how to fix it.  So I called Sennheiser.  I talked to a guy that seemed to know something about the unit.  When I told him that I had determined that the lights weren't coming on at the base, and it looked like the power was not working (I had done troubleshooting at other plugs, etc.)  Anyway, he was real nice, said it looked like the power supply was out, and that the company would send another one.  He transferred me to a woman that was in another department, she took my location information, and sent it out.  When it arrived, I plugged it in and it worked(!).      The device works just fine, as the other reviewers have said.  I can go to the other side of our building while using it, have not run out of batteries, it fits a little bit lower than my Phillips brand hp's, so I look a little less like a dork at the office.  By the way, using hp's is not just for music, I can listen to reminder recordings, language recordings off my mp3 list compiled on computer and conferted on goldwave. There are a large variety of educational and informational recordings that can be heard on the computer, and then listended to  while working around the office.  Oh,and then there's aol comedy, which keeps me down at the office cleaning up when I'd otherwise leave.    So in conclusion, the device is good, and it looks like the manufacturer will help, if necessary."
RG7Q0NZN04IK8,4,"The headphones sounded great and fit comfortably over my head.  I noticed some hissing and static but I could minimize these with the fine tuning dial.  Some may find these headphones a little bulky and heavy, but they were comfortable to me."
R2NKPFMB0MZGYX,5,"I have only had the set for about a month, but I really like them.  We live in a small house and the TV can be heard almost everywhere.  We also both work from our home.  The headset allows us to watch TV without interfering with the other person is working.  I have also found that I can walk around the house, and listen to the TV.  I like that and it is an added benefit I didn't expect.  Great for sports.  Sometimes there is a slight delay in the sound and the lip movement is off by a split second, but that doesn't happen during all programs.  I highly recommend this product."
RBQ278UQDS7DT,5,"These wireless headphones are great for listening to TV programs and movies.  They work with digital sound.  Unfortunately, because of the quality of these headphones, TV ads sound even more obnoxious with the headphones than without.  TV dialog sounds great including softly spoken words.  I have not tried them for music so I cannot comment about that.  I only have 2 complaints about them.  First, a manual would have helped for tuning, charging them, etc.  However, it only took me about 5 minutes to figure everything out with some trial and error.  Second, the headphones sit a little loose on my head.  If I look down, the headphones will slip despite adjustments.  Otherwise, I am very pleased and think that these Sennheiser wireless headphones with charging cradle are an excellent purchase for the Amazon price.  They are also highly rated on another technical website."
R1CYY1SM4O9SGT,1,"After fighting with these headphones for a few hours tonight, I felt compelled to write my VERY FIRST review here on Amazon! That's how completely disappointed I am in this unit. Hopefully this will save others from making the mistake of purchasing these.     As the title says, the auto-off feature renders these headphones utterly useless. They work fine for awhile, then suddenly turn off, even though there is no break in the audio! When the unit shuts off, the resulting loud static through the headphones is jolting, to say the least. After the first time, the automatic shut-off seemed to become more frequent (every five minutes or so), even though there was plenty of sound. I'd give zero stars if I could."
R2Y3Q8RW6XHUJ7,4,"Overall, I enjoy these headphones...they have a few major design flaws though.        GOOD  -Perfect weight, not too heavy not too light  -Actual sound is nice and rich  -Charging dock looks neat...and works just fine  -Charging dock uses swappable cables(the input is 3.5mm so you can use any cable)  -Includes accessories      BAD  -Auto shut off triggers after about 1 minute of silence....then HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  -Fair range, static begins after 13 feet."
RJRSXDU41GJIZ,4,"We live in a thirty two foot fifth wheel trailer, which allows us to stay where the weather is nicer and see some of our great country.  We have two televisions and sometimes outside noise (planes and trains or construction) interfere with viewing pleasure. My wife and I thought this item would afford a way to assist her in hearing the television as well as allow the sound to be off on the livingroom TV so the bedroom TV could be viewed without dealing with the sound of another TV.     We feel the headphones are excellent in sound quality. The charging dock is convenient. Our problem is the fit for my wife.  If you have a smaller head size (my wife wears size 6 1/4 hat) the headphones are loose and fall when she bends forward.  They fit my size 7 1/8 head just fine. The information with the headphones cautions against storing them over anything which would spread them. From the day we received them they have been too wide as they are now.  No instruction was given to cause them to be smaller or closer together. So if you are buying for a smaller head you might want to consider another brand or style."
R3I0MWQRGXS1NO,3,"If you can only spend $50, these'll do.  They're not great but they're better than tripping over a headphone extension cord.  Now...    My spot is 10-15 ft. away from the base unit.  If I tilt my head the wrong way or something, I get \\""fuzz\\"" along with the source material until I adjust how I'm sitting.  Next, because these don't fit over your ear but rather rest entirely on your ear, they are uncomfortable after more than an hour or so.  Lastly, the sound quality is less than ideal.  I suspect those of you with iPods and Zunes get better audio quality from your stock ear buds.    Taking all of that into account...  If you can't afford the $200 and up sets, these do work and I've been using mine for over a year.  Regular headphones, like these, in a wireless model keep getting harder and harder to find.    Thought you should know..."
R2KYLHQWZR1JCF,5,"This works on my Samsung Plasma.  I plugged the base unit into the wall and into the audio 3.5 jack on the back of my TV.  Just go to tv menu and turn set the audio to external speaker.  Works perfectly.  There is a tuner wheel and volume wheel on the headphones to eliminate any buzz or static.  They work all throughout my house.    Note the base unit needs to be near the tv, stereo or other device since it has to be plugged into the audio output."
RGBVBXJA60C47,4,"I'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET... THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE GREAT! I MAINLY USE THEM TO PLAY MY PS3 GAMES AT NIGHT... YOU CAN EASILY PAY ALOT MORE IF YOUR INTO ALL THE \\""NAME-BRANDS\\"" OR \\""HAVING THE LATEST VERSION\\""... OR IF YOUR LIKE ME AND DONT REALLY CARE FOR ALL THAT, GET THESE YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
R3OP9OS5Q31U06,5,"This product is of exceptional quality; I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend the headphones.  They boast clarity, comfort and do exactly the job I wished.  The price was right, ordering was simple, delivery was timely.  World Wide Stereo, I'll be a return customer and recommend you highly!"
RK1PVG1WY1DUF,5,"First the bad which are minor.  1. I would like it if the tune and volume controls were not so close together but it is a minor thing.  2. The connection cable ends in 2 RCA connectors. They include an adapter that plugs these into with a male 3.5 mm standard plug. The problem with this set up is there are going to be some situations where it is going to be very hard to plug in because of the size of the adapter. I can just barely plug it into my flat panel TV because of this. I promptly ordered a short extension off Amazon which will fix this. Again it is a minor thing.  Now the good. These use replaceable AAA rechargeables. They come with 2 and I have some already so I was ready to go. I bought these to watch TV at night. I work odd hours so I often want to watch TV while the Wife is sleeping. Had been using a set of headphones with an extension cord which of course works, but is a PITA. I had looked at some of these that were cheaper and saw a lot of bad reviews. These work great, sound is about the same as the headphones I had been using, and no more wire in the way.    So I decided to see how they sound with music. Plugged into an MP3 player in bedroom and walked around the house. Sound quality is about the same as a set of cheap wired headphones. You do need to have the volume up all the way at the source to keep the hiss out. Now if you are expecting great sound quality, no you will not get it. This same company makes some of these that cost 3 times as much so I expect they would sound much better. Bottom line for the price of these you get your moneys worth."
R3J95WL8LTMDCL,3,These are great when you plan to sit still otherwise the headphones will constantly slide off. After wearing these for a long period of time my ears began to hurt. These are perfect for watching TV. I love to be able to hang them up on the recharging stand and be ready to use for the next time.
R2VKTTH233OT6A,5,"This was purchased for my husband, who likes the TV loud!!!  It is the second one we have purchased, the other lasted about three years.  It does save a marriage."
R2F0CV9HW93IKQ,5,"I have used this product for several weeks and found it easy to use and with very satisfactory reception. It has a very attractive design that melds in the living room setting. We have connected it with the settop box because the tv with which we use it does not have an audio-out outlet. Once in a while we listen to shows like the GLEE and the music reception is very satisfactory. In otherwords, I am not sure it will satisfy listners of classical music who are extremely serious about the sound. In comparison, the Sony headset not only did not charge properly but was extremely bulky and ugly. I would recommend this unit strongly."
RLL69ATXUHBIY,5,I love my new Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle. I have been suffering from hearing loss over the past few years. I have 3 kids so the noise level in my home can be overwhelming. I bought these so that I could enjoy the upcoming football season. I have found that I am using the headphones more than I anticipated.<br /><br />These headphones are amazing. The sound quality is great and they are extremely easy to use.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
R30QZC0QO8D0WP,4,"My last Sennheiser was the model HDR 65 and I was a little unsure I'd be happy with this less expensive model.  I'm pleasantly surprised as it sounds as good and the charging and reception is every bit as good.  The only thing that is of mild concern is the looseness of the fit.  Although that makes it very comfortable it also let it fall off very easily if I'm not careful. Listening while washing dishes or cooking is of particular worry.  I just have to be more careful with it and the looseness almost makes me forget I'm wearing it, which is good."
R6TFA90EHMY3T,5,"THANKS,  I NOW DON'T HAVE OTHERS YELLING AT ME TO LOWER THE VOLUMN OF THE TV OR DVD OR STEREO .  EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE IS DISABLED AND NOISE OF ANY KIND REALLY BOTHERS OTHERS.  I ENJOY ALL TYPES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND THE WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE PERFECT FOR EACH KIND AND GREAT IN EACH ROOM. I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HEAD SET EXCEPT IT IS A LITTLE LOOSE ON MY HEAD.  I LIKE A REAL TIGHT FIT, HOWEVER, IT'S NOT A REAL PROBLEM !!   I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I WISH I HAD BOUGHT IT SOONER !"
RN0FC8VZTHA7P,4,"these headphones are great. i was looking for a wireless set to take some of the noise pollution out of our house and experience some of my music collection at a deeper level.  Both happened. Physically, they are near perfect. They are easy to use and adjustable to all shapes of heads and the volume control is very simple.  Overall, I am very pleased with these headphones and hope to have them for several years.  I read reviews here and though I did my \\""research\\"". Sometimes things aren't quite how the reviews say they are. But in this case, it's a home run."
R3VN6GPGLMX39T,4,"The tuning wheel for reception is a bit fiddly, and the power switch is small.  But they otherwise fit well and have good sound quality."
R2JTWR7ALXG5W0,5,Loved everything about it from the ease of use to comfort to sound quality.  Thinking about buying a second pair.
R38NZUGD0PGBKF,5,"I spent A LOT of time looking for wireless headphones. Stumbled across these and kept coming back to it as a possibility. I ordered them and they are AWESOME!! Hook-up is simple enough and the sound quality is great no matter how far from the base I am. The recharge feature is so convenient; I don't have to worry about batteries!! The only downside is that the frame is a little big causing it to slide occasionally, but never off completely. Its adjustabily just doesn't count for smaller heads. All in all, a great buy. ^_^ definitely worth it."
R1VI7A2URY31L,4,"Sennheiser RS120 are the first wireless headphones I've owned, so I can't tell how the level of background noise compares to other products.  However, the quality of sound is clearly inferior to that in wired headphones.  The phones have a tuning control, which can be used to find the frequency with least noise, but the best it can produce is still imperfect.  Nevertheless this product is very convenient if wired phones won't do, and even if the quality of sound isn't perfect it's still good enough for watching TV."
RHHICW7HSKDE5,4,"Except for the volume/tune controls being too close to each other, these have been great. They do lose their reception if the do not perceive a signal for a period of time, but it's not an issue with the music I listen to, or the games that I or my kids play.  The alow us to complete our \\""wireless\\"" computer with wireless keyboard, mouse, monitor and sound.  For the price, these are great.  I would recommend these to anybody who is looking for a wireless headphone experience - not the \\""audiophile\\"" who is used to a $300 pair of headphones, or $2000 speakers."
R1AVHC649HIEBD,1,"Hello,    Got the headphones to work with my stereo receiver but can't get them to work with either of my plasma TVs.  Am I doing something wrong?  I doubt it!  Tried every plug on the TV and still no go.    HELP!"
R1DS01O9KY23ZT,5,"These headphones are the best thing since canned corn. I can listen to tv in bed while simultaneously drowning out my husbands snoring. No more having to turn the volume up and waking the whole house to hear it over mister \\"" I don't care how loud I'm snoring and I'm not going to the doctor even if I swallow my own tongue\\"". I can get up walk around, get a snack etc. And not miss a thing. Awesome product."
R3RA9B9IQF3TZI,4,"Even though the reviews were mostly positive, I was skeptical and held off purchasing the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones until the last minute.  Now that I have had a chance to use the headphones, I couldn't be happier. They're comfortable and the sound quality is quite good. I wear the headphones when I am out in the yard and want to continue listening to my favorite music channel.  At night, the headphones come in handy when I don't want to wake anyone up.<br /><br />Update: January 2012<br />After using this headset for a year-and-a-half now, it still continues to come in handy and works fairly well.  My one complaint is that the volume is a bit sensitive.  Sometimes I need to switch the unit off and then on again to get the volume to work.  Other times I need to press onto the volume dial to get it to work.  Quirky things, to be sure, but I am hoping they aren't indicative of a bigger problem yet to come that may render the headphones inoperable.<br /><br />I've reduced my five star rating to four based on the events of the past year that were described above."
R3D3CPRBYAEMZ1,4,"These wireless phones were purchased to replace some Sony's that were damaged by a lightning strike (NOT while on my head.) I have owned 3 sets of the Sony product, and wanted to try something else. The Sennheisers are very impressive by comparison. Since the basics of this product are fairly straightforward, there aren't many bells and whistles to rate. They fit well, hold a charge well and the sound quality is loud and clear. The Sony product may hold a slight edge in ear comfort, but it's a close call.    So far, I really like these Sennheisers."
R1GMO3WOS8FZKF,5,"I purchased this item about three weeks ago primarily for use with the Television and it serves this purpose well.  The main problem I have with Television is that many times the background music or noise is such that it garbles the sound of the dialogue.  With these headphones there seems to be a crisper sound so that the dialogue is clear and crisp.  I have been able to run off to the back bedroom, which is probably fifty or sixty feet from the Television and the signal is still strong.  It is also a pleasure to be able to reach up the left headphone and click the off button to silence the screaming commercials... or just slip the headsets off.    I have Time Warner and they have a group of music channels on their lineup and I re-discovered the pleasure of listening to stereo using headphones again.  I had forgotten just how nice that can be.  They can also be used with the computer.    I doubt you can do much better in this price range and likely not even if you spend quite a bit more.    It was a good choice."
R3BS4UG211IUBQ,5,Much better than previous models which had a tendency to break at the at the head piece. Also better reception.
R1YC1WX9NH12A2,4,"These work best if you have a way to silence the regular TV/audio device speakers, thus you can turn up that silenced volume to mid-level and adjust the headset volume to mid-level.    They work poorly if you can't silence the TV speakers and you just try to turn that volume low. There isn't enough audio signal above the noise(carrier frequency) to prevent poor quality reception.    The two headsets can receive different signals independently, even when co-located or both can lock in on a single source. The base transmit signals can be easily adjusted to different frequencies.    I have not noticed any RF frequency collisions, at all-  other headset, baby monitor, cell phone, cordless phone, WI-FI, garage door opener, bluetooth, nothing, na-da, ...    I have no experience with more than two headsets, I have no clue how well a third headset might co-exist."
RP9EED6Q4KFBB,4,"I bough the RS210 type and to be honest I had a hard time setting up the headphones initially because I kept getting this spotty static kinda sound which stayed whatever I tired. I even wrote an email to the Sennheiser guys, but just after I sent out the email, I discovered a little white knob at the front lower edge of the base unit. It says \\""CHANNEL\\"". It is quite small, almost invisible. I tweaked with this knob, changed it to another position and BAM! the static sound was gone. Now the sound is almost as clear as if I am using wired headphones.    Now I truly believe the product deserves all the positive surveys it has gathered. For anyone who is on the fence thinking about buying this thing, I'd encourage them to buy it."
RPL5RNRDJH2QV,5,"I have two beautiful children, a 1 and 2 year old, which, as anyone with kids know, there's simply no time to watch TV (or much else) while they are awake.  So we record our favorite shows on our AT&T Uverse system and watch them when our little ones go to sleep.  Of course, we try to keep the volume down so not to disturb them (NEVER WAKE A SLEEPPING BABY), but we're always rewinding the recording or asking each other \\""what did he say?\\"".   So I decided to research for wireless headphone that would solve our problem and found the Sennheiser line to be very popular and reliable amongst reviewers.  I took the plunge, but not before debating over what model to buy.  At first I thought that the pricier models might be better, but then figured I'd take the chance with the Sennheiser RS120 and hope for the best.  I was soooo pleasantly surprised with these cans.  They are crystal clear, the sound quality was amazing, and the comfort level was definitely up there.  Although my ears did get a little fatigued after about 2 hours of use, nothing extreme though...very tolerable.  The range is great as well.  My wife sometimes gets up to get a snack and she can hear everything perfectly from the kitchen which is about 40-50 feet from the source.  I read on other reviews of hissing and noise problems, so I was prepared for some myself, especially with all the wireless toys I have (wireless internet, wireless surround sound, wireless telephone - all of which have been one at the same time while using the RS 120).  But through it all, the sound quality remained perfect.  Even when there's no sound (i.e. pausing or muting the program), I still don't hear any noise.  I have no regrets buying this model.  You'll enjoy them too!"
RBS503SIYOTZS,5,I don't usually leave reviews but I have to on this one.  I ordered it because I am hearing impaired and have the hardest time hearing the TV.  I usually leave it on mute and just watch the closed caption on any show.  Now for the first time in YEARS I can actually watch tv/movies.  I seriously love it!  The clarity of it is amazing.  I can go do the dishes in another room and not miss a single word.  I didn't think I'd ever hear tv again.  I suggested my step father try it out because he too has horrible hearing and rather than tune the whole house out with the loud volume I think he will love this.  I will probably be buying him a set for his upcoming birthday.  Even if you don't have hearing problems and you just want the feel of a surround sound system without blaring out the whole house you should seriously give this a try.  I don't really like how loose it fits if I lean down but if it were too tight on my head it would probably give me a headache.  Just beware not to lean over if you are wearing them because they do easily slide off.
R3P1FXNP4TIDJK,5,"These headphones fit well and provide high quality sound.  I love the fact that they are wireless, making it possible to walk around in the house and still hear the TV or music clearly."
RPDBFEFTYLTJC,5,"I have been using superb Sony studio style headphones for last few years, but was annoyed when I had to step outside for smoke while watching some shows. After reading the reviews for this product I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad that I did!! The headphones feel featherweight, they fit so perfectly on my ears that I can wear them for hours without getting tired around ears. The springy action of the band is neither tight not too light - it is perfect! The quality of sound is fantastic! The volume control is a great convenience built right into the headphones - not rocket science but something I missed on the previous Sony headphones. The reception is superb. I now listen to music all the time - while working, while cooking, etc. Very pleasurable experience!!!"
R1IB5QUQS5WF4L,1,"I purchased two of these to replace two old ones I had.  I thought I'd upgrade with modern headphones.  It was a big mistake.  These were really bad.  There was static and background noise.  When I turned my head, the signal was lost.  I tried without success to make them work.  Further, they didn't fit well. The ear pieces are flat and press on the ear, rather than cupping or enclosing the ear.  There is uncomfortable pressure on the ear and if you bend over, they slip off. I went back to using my old headphones that work perfectly.  They are much better than these, even though they are approximately 10 years old and were inexpensive.  I was, however, impressed with Amazon by the way they handled these returns.  They make returns quite easy."
R24JH73JKFODWU,5,I purchased the equivalent model at least two years ago and I love them.  I even wear them when there is no one around to bother.  I did a bunch of research on these earphones before I bought them and decided that they fit my needs and the price was more than fair.  I have recommended these to friends and this year bought my sister a pair for her birthday.  She had been using a pair of el cheapos that hardly allowed moving around the room before the distortion started. She called me the first day she tried them out and was blown away by the difference in sound quality as well as the ability to move from room to room without missing any of the program.    One of the gripes I read about was that the controls were too small and it was difficult to use them.  I found no problem with this.  I have noted no abnormal frequency in having to change the batteries and I use them alot now that I am retired and have more time to watch TV.  The sound on many movies these days is often variable or too low so I especially like not having to keep replaying a scene to see if I can figure out what a performer just said.    Well worth the purchase price!
R3VNHMYT53IOS1,5,Used these to replace my nearly worn out set of a different make. What a difference in sound and ease of use. No messing around replacing or recharging batteries thanks to what I think is a very clever recharging stand.  Bravo Sennheiser.
R31DVFFYS6JTH6,5,"Headphones are great, would recommend them to anyone with a hearing problem, My brother uses the headphones with his TV so he can hear it, before the volume on the Tv was so loud it was disturbing others.  These headphones are his new best friend.  I would recommend the headphones to anyone."
R3827D1WT49MG5,2,"I also bought into all the 4 and 5 star reviews and have had these headphones for almost 2 years now. The hiss, although noticeable, isn't what bothers me the most about these headphones.    What bothers me the most is the automatic gain control. Automatic gain control tries to normalize the volume of what you're hearing by turning down the volume when something loud plays. Other reviewers say that it ruins the music you listen to if the music has fast crescendos or other suddenly-loud attributes. For gaming, this is a problem all the time, especially for first person shooters like Modern Warfare or Counter Strike Source. When the game gets into a lull, any sudden gunfire will lower the volume almost to the point where you can't hear anything for the next few seconds. I also have problems listening to people talk on Ventrilo if they have a (bad) microphone with a high initial attack. They'll talk and then I won't be able to hear the next 5 or so seconds of speech. If you game or voice chat, these headphones will likely frustrate you to no end.    Other cons: noticeably poor bass compared to my 5.1 speaker system, and poor reception if the base is near my monitor.    Pros: No sweat on my ears; I can wear these for hours with little discomfort. Freedom to listen to music or voice chat while in another room is great. Really decent midrange audio.    NB: Since I'm a gamer, it would have made more sense for me to buy wired headphones with surround sound. But at least now I'll be able to say I've tried wireless."
REMTAM1NW86J8,5,This is the best wireless headphone I ever had.  It was so easy to tune in and the sound is great for the price I paid.
RUHAX2846IYHO,4,"They have great sound quality, no need to tune it to find the right frequency. There is no hum or high pitch tone that I had with old model, unless there is no audio signal of course.  I love these headphones and if forced to talk about minor problems they would be a) if wearing the headphone and you attempt to change the volume you may change the frequency instead, both control wheels are on the same side. B) The head phones charge by placing them on the main unit, this is great, but initial charge the connection was hard to maintain and I had to put a book on the head phones to maintain the connection. As I used them over the next few days it occurred less and less, and now I place the headphones on the charger and there is no problem. It seems the padding was getting in the way and after some use the padding was compressed enough to be a non-issue."
R18I47OZJIH667,4,"Its one of mine first reviews and im not the guy who writes a lot. so, here it is: first thing that i want to say is that this is a product for the money. when i read other reviewes about them its came out to be true about side noise when in use but its not a big deal in reality. Good quality of sound i would say and sometimes i have statick noise but its fixible when u take jaks from tv (as im using it for) out and put them in right back. And i think its a solution for this problem. over all its dicent piece of equipment and for almost 70 buck u getting more than everage quality product."
R28TIOFXJC3CSV,5,Received two units one of which is the transmitter plus a spare. It took two minutes to connect to the TV and the units have worked tirelessly ever since.   Great value for money from a high profile brand.
RFTO0MR602R70,1,"Well the noise is horrible on this things, whether it's from picking up static or from auto gain I don't know. And I don't care. The fact that it's constantly in your ears a little and when the sound on tv is low you get a lot of the static noise (can deafen you) - has no excuse.<br />I didn't return it because the charging station is very nice and I bought it so my wife won't bother me with blasting TV, so I don't really care about quality of her reality tv shows. But I wouldn't recommend those to anyone."
R2JICNQUQ062W1,5,"For the money, this turned out to be the best  decision. I would buy this again."
R2YDVPNJ5IQ3BJ,4,"I received this item today. After playing around with it, it turned out to be a decent product. The only complaint I have is the ear cushions. After a while they become really hot, and I have to take them off for couple mins.  The range in incredible, I can go farther than my wireless router can. Another small thing is that there is a faint hiss, and can be noticeable if listened to soft songs. Sound wise, I was really shocked at the quality of the sound, can't really expect better than this.     Pros: The range is awesome. Sound is incredible, very similar to wired.     Cons: The ear cushions get hot after awhile. A faint hiss can be heard."
R2YFM70UOU3ZPF,5,"I work in an open bull pen office with 300 people. I sit right next to the phone bank for customer service. Headphones are essential to my working sanity. These headphones are great. I can wear them all day with no battery issues, no earlobe pain, no sweaty ears, and no need to continuously adjust the fit. I put them on, I turn them on, I tune out the world for hours. The recharge base is super easy to use -- just set the headphones on it. No plugging in each time or changing batteries. I set mine behind my monitor so I don't have to see it or have it in the way. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't comment on the finer points of audio quality, but for your average techy geek who likes electronics and wants something that sounds good (like me) these fit the bill. Haven't had any interference in the signal. Haven't had any issues whatsoever. Very pleased."
R1W1HIAV43I3B6,4,"Sound quality is good. *NO* noise cancelling, but that might not be a bad thing -- with the music turned up about half way, I can still hear my coworkers when they need my attention.    Being able to walk around without yanking the cables off of whatever I'm listening to is nice.     Just wanted to mention: These are only comfy if I'm not wearing my glasses. If you wear your glasses while wearing this for more than an hour, it presses in and hurts terribly. =("
R2B9IA88X392KO,5,"My husband is a full time grad student and has a full time job.  This means no TV for him for a while.  But we want to be able to occupy the same space, even if we aren't doing the same activity. These headphones are terrific.  I can go all the way into the back yard (5k sq ft lot) and upstairs and the headphones don't even crackle.  I usually DVR whatever I'm watching so I can fast forward during the commercials.  But now, I can get up and put laundry away, do some dishes, grab the mail, and know when commercials are up.  This came in especially handy during World Cup, when I was quite glued to the TV for a while.  The only downside: I can't lay down (on my side on the couch) and watch a movie.  The headphones are plenty comfortable when I'm just wearing them, but they aren't exactly two giant pillows.  I don't imagine any design, other than ear buds, would really change that fact.  Love these headphones. I seriously don't know why I hemmed and hawed so long before getting these.  They're worth every penny.  Feb 2012 Update: Now that we have a new baby, I use these after he goes to bed so I can watch a show or movie while I'm on the elliptical.  They do warm my ears up a little, which I don't love.  I just hook them up to the laptop with the little adaptor that comes with the unit (glad I didn't throw that out) and away I go!  They are too heavy to stay on my head for stretching after, but that just motivates me to stay on the elliptical for a whole show.  Great product."
R91H6OX88HYMA,1,"These headphones, despite the miraculous reviews on here, don't even work with my TV!  They're incompatible with the newer TV's, which don't offer RCA Audio Output anymore.  These headphones are old school, and will not work on the newer model TVs.  Complete waste of time & effort for me ordering these headphones.  I wouldn't have liked them anyway, had my TV been compatible.  Not worth the $64 price tag.  They probably cost $4 to manufacture."
R13TFZRL9I6XFQ,4,"Re: Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle<br />....Almost returned these because I did not receive any transmission from them when I plugged the jacks into the TV, nor did I see any light go on the transmitter.<br /><br />But then I noticed a very small box in a corner of the packaging in which the device had been shipped; it turned out to be the adapter, a necessary component for the operation of the set. As soon as I plugged that into both the transmitter and a wall socket, the transmitter lit up and the audio turned on.<br /><br />It would have been useful to have solid instructions that clearly listed the purpose/function of each component instead of assuming that all are self-evident. Unless a client has had previous experience with wireless devices, self-evidence is not a strong suite....Also would be considerate to state the average or proximate length of time the headphones continue to be effective before the sound fades as it takes 16 hours to recharge the batteries."
R26YZKFTT0LV8E,5,"This product works very well for watching tv; it is crisp, clear and the sound quality is excellent without any static.   The range is over 35'.  However, if you are an audiophile and want to listen to music, I would suggest a higher model.  It only takes a few minutes to set up.  Comes with RCA connectors and the large and small single plug adaptors.  My only criticism is that the earpieces are flat rather than fitted.  I feel they would be much more comfortable if they fit over your ears.  Bottom line:  this is a good product that works the way it is supposed to."
R30K7T5XTVSKSZ,5,I read all the previously written reviews about this particular wireless headphone.  I also compared those reviews to reviews written about other wireless headphones.  Then I went ahead and bought the headphones and have been very pleased with it.  The previous reveiws were very helpful to me becasue they informed me of what to expect from these headphones so when I purchased them and used them there were no surprises.  The sound is excellent.  The ease of not having a wire attached to them is wonderful.  I was able to get up and walk around the room and didn't loose the sound.  It is so convienent to sit them back on the cradle where they recharge.  I would definetly buy this model of wireless headphones again.  They have met my expectations.
R3ADXG68ZS7D6O,4,Received the product sooner thanexpected.  Installation was easy.  Works well. I was a little dissapointed at the sound coming from of the unit.  I guess I expected it to be better than the sound from my TV.  It is not.  Would I buy it now that I have some experience with it? - Yes.
RANOWJG4Y614S,4,"I got these for my dad to use when watching TV.   For him they work great he just leaves them on and they turn them selves off when you lay it on the charger.  Also because of the design he doesnt have to deal with plugging anything in to charge them, you just rest the headphones on the stand and they charge.   The only issue we have noticed is that they just kind of float on your head and dont feel sturdy.  This is fine most of the time except that he wanted to use them while doing dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen but we fear that they will end up in the sink.   So if you only plan on using these while sitting down i give them a 5 star, but why would you really want wireless headphones if you cant do stuff around the house while you wear them?"
R26KJY1XJHXLBZ,4,"the earphones perform very well, and allows others in the room to have normal TV volume while a person with hearing difficulty can have great sound"
R38PUL1VWZ7FIA,4,Found these headphones to be worth the money for my use. Watching TV late at night.
R23TPQDBX1GA8R,4,"These work great.  My only complaint is that, if I am working around the house and I bend over to pick up something, they may slide off of my head.  Sitting in a chair is no problem.  I recommend them."
R16LI3C9J3H78J,5,For the price this is a very good unit. The sound for movies and music is excellent and I would think for the average person they would agree. I bought this for guests/family watching TV late at night and can do so and not keep everyone else up. The instructions are not to clear and you really have to pay attention to where you hook the audio out. I have a flat screen TV and the sound is outputted to a Denon receiver to external speakers. I also have a blue ray ( LG - wifi ) player hook to the TV via HDMI cable and we only watch Netflix movies over wifi. So I had to hook the unit to the AUDIO OUT on the blue ray - LG player to get the sound ( not to TV or receiver) but to LG audio out. Works great and very happy.   If its a little scratchy the sound you just have to make sure you FINE TUNE the headset frequency by turning the knob to exactly where its clear and than you wont hear scratchy sounds if you move.   I will be buying another of these units very soon.   I am not sure how long the battery last as I have not worn them out yet but seem to be holding up well.
R3CGIX5QABPW2Z,2,I replaced my original pair of headphones of the same brand with this model. This must be a different model than my original headphones. The 10-level tuning push button on my original pair is was replaced with a tuning wheel on the new set. My mother in law is hard of hearing and uses the headphones which allows my wife and I to hear our TV in the other room. Unfortunately my mother in-law also has no manual  dexterity and she is constantly touching the tuning wheel loosing the audio.     Make sure you upgrade to the model with the tuning button if the headphone are for an elderly person.
R3K9PKNP39RKZH,2,"Sennheiser has been one of the leading headphone manufacturers for   years and when I was looking for headphones for the work computer  and saw these it seemed like a no brainer to purchase them.  While they sound great when working properly, they cut in and out   repeatedly and lose sound at times due to what seems to be  bad connections to the earpieces. This happens to a lot of  electronics firms when they try and move to the lower end of  the price spectrum (witness the lack of quality of Bose since they  they started mass producing the home theater line). Because of this problem I cannot  recommend this product."
R8FIMHGY91D6J,4,"I've been using these for about an hour or two at night after my GF goes to sleep and they are great. I am using them with my receiver and the sound is good. The range, which I haven't tested the limits off, seems good as I have no problems throughout the apartment even when in other rooms. The hiss is only audible when the volume is dialed up. I mostly use it for TV, so I don't know how the sound is for audiophiles..."
R2DUA3OROQZW5R,4,"These headphones work well for my purpose. I am not an audiophile, but I find the audio quality to be very good. The headphones fit in such a way that I can lay back in a recliner and just listen to music. I also find that wearing the headphones let me hear the television better because most of the distracting noise I get otherwise is blocked, yet I can hear if someone tries to get my attention."
R3QLCHF2FVERA3,4,"This headphone exhibits the usual Sennheiser quality and attention to detail.  Keep in mind that this is an analog set, not one of the newer digital variety.    Sound quality is fine, reception good.  Battery life seems OK but no real data yet - it  has been used for about 12 \\""on\\"" hours without needing to be recharged.    The ergonomics of the base station/charger unit are the same as in previous Sennheiser models, a bit too large and visible for my taste.  Also a fairly large opening vertically is needed to place the headphone unit on the charger stand (about 8\\"").    The phones fit my head fine but the pads are fairly firm - definitely not 'cushion' fit.  Allows a bit more external noise than I would like.  However, they are comfortable enough after an hour or two.    Bottom line:  this is a capable wireless headphone, and for the money, an outstanding value."
R1ARSZ6992WN8I,5,"My husband has trouble hearing the TV and has had headphones before. Some have been uncomfortable, some have static every time he turns his head, this set was just great! No negatives and does allow him to now enjoy television again."
RMTZZGWIGEIK4,4,"This product works very well and allows a person with hearing loss to hear everything on TV clearly.  The only drawback is that, when someone is wearing the earphones, they have to be removed to hear what the person next to you is saying because they block sound not coming from the TV."
R2C5YQN16FCGWF,5,"I bought these headphones for my hard-of-hearing mother last year.  They are fantastic and high quality.  Now my mother can watch TV and hear perfectly, while the rest of us can set the TV speaker volume to \\""normal.\\""  (Just make sure you connect the headphone wires so that you still have TV speakers ON)  Battery life is great and the auto-recharging works perfectly.  The bonus is that that my mother can now also work around the house and even out in the yard and set listen to her favorite TV shows.  And they are perfect for watching late night TV without bothering anyone else.  I would recommend these headphones to everyone."
R2ZJ9A5JWJ5YJE,5,"I bought this headphones in Nov 2009 for $63 from this seller.The headphone has been great for last 9 months, good reception and clarity.   -  This is compatible CRT TV, HDTV, Computer.   -  I can play games without disturbing others.   -  The range is pretty good, I can listen to TV anywhere I have tested upto 70-75 feet.  -  The battery has got long life...the battery last for 24-36 hrs of  playing.  I highly recommend Sennheiser RS120 from this seller."
R2FKJH5H8FWV04,4,"I love the wireless feature.  comerical comes on I jump up and get something done ie fillup washer, clear table of dishes, take out trash and I always know when the show is back on.  the only downfall of this Item is when you bend over the headphones slip right off your head.  I solved this by wearing a baseball type cap with a bill.  Of course while I watch my Tv I hear everything more clearly and family can listen to thier music or chat on phone and it doesn't bother me, or them."
R3T0E0RWV8K9N4,5,"I've read the one and two star reviews that find fault with these headphones, but I have yet to experience any downside.  I've owned these headphones for about one month and just love them.  The transmitter was simple to hook up to my cable box with the included component cables (other connectors also included, i.e. earphone jack adaptor) and the headphones worked as soon as I turned them on.  The sound is so much better than the 10W down-firing speakers in my Samsung HDTV and really helps me hear every word and sound of the show or movie I'm watching.  I'm a bit hard of hearing and didn't realize all that I was missing listening to the TV through the speakers.  The volume control is broad, allowing me to listen as quietly or loud as I choose.  Even with my hearing loss, turning the volume all the way up is too loud for ear comfort.  There is no sound distortion even at higher volumes.  So far, the range of the transmitter has been excellent.  I can walk all around my house, including upstairs and into the basement without the slightest static.  Since I'm usually watching TV lying propped up on the couch, I wear the headphones just in front of my ears so they don't bump into the couch cushions behind my head.  Therefore, I can't really speak to whether my ears get sweaty after prolonged use.  I do know that I have no discomfort from the ear cups even after 3+ hours wearing them.  Recharging is also simple, as the headphones naturally slide into the proper charging position on the transmitter when set on it.  I have yet to have any issue with battery life, even after using the headphones constantly for 3+ hours.  In short, I love these headphones and they have lived up to my every expectation!"
RHHNQZ15S8BXP,5,"Well, this product amazed me it had the sound quality of $80 skullcandy's but it was wireless, the wireless part of it is also amazing great quality until about 350 ft, outside of my house, with the transmitter in the basement connected to my computer, i listen to alot of music and it just seems to work great, you can mow and actually hear the music, a definite good buy, i just was wondering if they could make it more portable so you dont have to plug it into the wall, otherwise I highly reccomend it"
R1UCF2XHID6MS6,5,This unit replaced a pair I have been using for over 3 years that finally died.  This unit is much easier to use (only one frequency adjust) and is much more comfortable wearing.  The sound is also much better than the old pair.  The batteries are standard rechargable types also.  I am expecting many years of use with these!!!
R3INUNLE5AWUCO,4,"I should start by saying that in terms of cord-free convenience, these wireless headphones are great.  The cradle works great, too, and everything is really easy to use.  They are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />However, I am constantly annoyed by two things.  First is the built-in volume compression.  I listen to vinyl records with them at my office desk and if I bump my desk (which may cause a spike in volume), the headphones reduce volume automatically.  Which means I have to turn up the headphone volume.  Which means more hiss and audible RF pop and crackle.  And second, the damn things beep at you all the time.  I read how you can turn off the beeping by holding down a button while putting in the batteries.  This fine works for a while, but eventually they start to beep at me again when there's silence for a minute or so.<br /><br />These are REALLY great if you're going to be moving around a lot, but I wish I'd spent the same amount of money on some wired headphones."
R2SEIGCJMYX70S,5,Very happy with the headphones. Battery life is longer than I anticipated and I can walk all around my house without losing  any sound quality.
R2A9IXTCBJAZ0G,5,"These just arrived yesterday and were bought as a gift for my husband so he can watch tv while I sew.  They worked from a room away (as far as we've tried them) and were crystal clear.    The earpiece covers could be a little move comfortable (they are just ont he verge of \\""itchy\\"") but other than that, they seem to be great!"
R2IG53E3M7V197,5,"I picked this over the lower model for the built in stand/charger, it was a gift for my father so he can watch tv when other people are in the house doing things, hes a bit def and these work wonderfully for him, he can hear the tv and the rest of us can talk and cook or whatever without him getting all Donald duck mad that he cant hear whats going on on the tv."
R1T62PUDB8EQVK,5,"I can actually enjoy tv now. Don't have to listen to it so loud! My husband loves them, but not as much as I do! Haven't had any trouble out of them."
R33TAMR7JJHP5J,5,"I use these for about 5 hours a day with no problem. So far the furthest I've been away from the base is about 200 feet while doing some weeding or getting the mail.  The reception has been clear at all times except when I accidently moved the tuner wheel.  This is the fourth set of earphones that I've owned and is the best by far. The others I have are RCA, Sony, and a direct wire set that are hooked up to other TV's."
RL8GQMIAFYGF2,2,"My son in law said this was a good product.  There was always a \\""shhhh\\""  in the background.  I used it while I exercised on the bike.  I could hear but it didn't have the quality that was reported.  My husband and son in law could not make it clear of the \\""shhhh\\"" sound."
R1WXZ71Z98ZVTU,3,"These FM wireless stereo headphones suffer from poor reception; there is almost always a hiss.  The closer to the transmitter the less the hiss. Within the house they work fine unless I am moving around. Being in one place with minimal movement gives best reception. Outside the house reception deteriorates rapidly.  Sound quality is good and the controls are easy to locate and operate with the headphones on. For $70, these are good value.  I found the headphones loose-fitting, and need to use a headband to keep them on my head when I move. But then I have a small head.  I originally tried headphones using Bluetooth, but the range was too limited at 30 feet. If I could find Bluetooth technology with a longer range, they would be my choice."
R2HCDKFG7MFGM,5,"I am extremely happy with this purchase and the quality of the product.   In a nutshell, it works as advertised.  The sound is crisp and clear.  Battery life is good.  The charging cradle is very convenient.  I recommend these headphones without reservation."
R26KKKFBKCQIUL,4,"It does what its supposed to do. If you need to wonder away from your TV (like say to another room) you will probably lose reception. However, if you are in front of your TV it works just fine. I consider myself a HD sound junkie, but I have relaxed my requirements in terms of wireless headphones as I am not willing to spend top dollar on something else."
RZYAEZ0TDVWIV,5,"this is my first pair of wireless headphones and i find them to be VERY comfortable and the range is very good 100m hard to beat that but i haven't taken them more then 200 feet so far but the farther u go the more static there is but thats expected with out it in direct line of site i got it to reach about 100 ft not to bad thats with its have to send a signal through a a thick wall tree and a table so its very good for distance and with the base sitting in my room i can go through the whole house with out a problem.......... when ur around metal like going in ur car to get something it gets kind of staticy ....... they are load headphones......... will last a whole day on one full charge.... u can hook it up to ur mp3, tv, computer, an electric guitar with the 2 adapters that come with it so if ur looking to not spend more then 100 bucks on a pair of wireless headphone these are ur best bet i would say because my friend has a $[...] pair of headphones that only have a 100 ft range so yea definitely consider these    update: i've had these for about a year now and they still are amazing i have had the base sitting on the ground level floor of my house and i went about 250-300 feet away from it and i could still use them!!!! and i forgot to mention some stuffin the last review like the fact that these are extremely comfortable and the sound quality it awesome and i think to oly problem i have with these is that you cant take them everywhere but i knew that when i bought them so not really a con so if you looking for a pair of wireless headphone i dont care if you find a 500 dollar pair of wireless headphones and you can afford the get these!!!! sennhieser is a great brand and if you want portability get there bluetooth set yes they are far more expensive but if you have them money go for it but if you have say a 150-200 dollar budget get these!!!!!! you wont be disappointed i promise"
RNM2R2XS7X866,3,"This headphone was given to me as a gift, at first I thought it was great but after owning it for a few months I can honestly say I don't like it. I have a problem with the volume dial, it is so close to the reception dial, what that does is make it so hard to turn up the volume without messing with the reception dial and visa versa . Another problem I have is with the size it's extremely bulky and ugly. The only great thing is the ease of recharging and the effortless connecting set up. My advice pay more get more"
R13KWB068PL6AD,5,"I couldn't be more pleased with a purchase than these headsets.  The sound quality is excellent, easy to wear, but could be a bit smaller, which would be the only change I would make.  I wear them all over the house and they maintain excellent reception.  I like to watch television to go to sleep, my husband does not.  These have saved multiple arguments over turning the TV down.  :)  I wear them a lot and have yet to run out of battery life.  As for the sound, it turns our regular television into a surround sound -- not actually, but it seems that way.  Being older, 60 to be exact, it also makes the dialogue much clearer.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for good headsets for a reasonable price."
R3PP7X8TLJAN0E,5,"I've had experience with Sennheiser headphones in one form or another for over 20 years. They have always been the right choice for phones, whether you're looking for audiophile grade, or are looking for a good sounding set on a budget. The decision to pick up the RS120 wireless unit was based on my experience with the RS140's at my work. I was impressed by the clear, artifact free sound I was getting, even at a 200 foot range, with the 140's. When I went to purchase a set for myself, I was sad to see that the 140's were discontinued, but the 120's seemed to have similar features, and were considerably less expensive. I'm happy to say that, though the 120's are missing the auto tune and compression features, the sound quality is actually better (fuller) than the 140's. This is due to the fact that the 120's utilize an open-air design, and the 140's were sealed cans for isolation. They definitely leak sound at high volume settings, so if you are seeking complete isolation, then the 120's may not be for you. For me, it's a non-issue. The sound quality, build quality, range and comfort of the 120's are so good, I almost can't believe that they are such a good deal! The re-charging system, which consists of hanging the phones up on the base unit's antenna, is ingeniously simple. The rechargeable batteries that come with the set are excellent, and they've never run out of juice while using, and I've used them as long as 8 hours at a stretch before. A real nice feature of this RS series, is that I can bring my 120 cans into work and tune them to work with the 140's transmitter! Excellent wireless system - I recommend!"
R3QZYC0TDVCQYE,4,The overall iem is good. The fit is a little loose and the sound is scratchy sometimes.
RD278UVVO55UJ,4,"Overall I really like these headphones. The good... The sound quality is excellent. The battery life and range are very good also. I just spent the last 4 hours outside detailing my husband's car for Father's Day. These headphones are hooked up to my computer on the opposite side of my house. I did not have a single moment of reception loss or static. I also use them to listen to music/podcasts while I am cooking, gardening and playing computer games.      The bad... These headphones are really large. I have no trouble when playing games or cooking. But when I bend over (garden/car) they quickly fall off my head. I either have to hold on with one hand, or move it so the strap is on the back of my head when I am bent over. Admittedly, I do not have a large head. However, I tried them on my husband with the same result. As another reviewer mentioned, I have also been told I look like an air traffic controller when I wear them. However, I don't care about that. I just wanted good sound. And they definitely have good sound.     Recommendation...  If you are going to be stationary while using these (computer/tv), I highly recommend them. If you are planning on working while using them, they may annoy you."
R1CU82ALKYW61O,1,"I bought this headphones couple of years ago.  Over the last year, when I raise or lower the volume, I can hear very bad noise or statics over the headphones.  By touching the knobs, the statics overpower the music.  I had to take the headphone apart at one time to clean the electronics, that was good for couple of months, now it's worse.  I might end buying the RS 140 now, since not too many companies make good quality wireless headphones, I still have hopes in sennheiser, and I'm willing to give them another chance."
R9P2LWWLTFT1X,2,"You might want to consider something else. I bought this in Oct 2008. By mid 2009 it was beginning to fail: static heard once in a while, one side or the other would stop working then come back, recharging took longer & length of use decreased as time progressed. Then in the spring of 2010 it died altogether. The head piece was comfortable, but loose fitting. The sound quality was ok but I think my Inke'd ear buds to my mp3 player sound better. The cordless convenience was wonderful, but I really expected these to last MUCH longer than they did. I don't think it's worth the $69.89 price. Over all I'm not happy with the quality or durability the Sennheiser brand lead me to expect, especially for this price range. I recommend you buy something else or cough up for the replacement warranty cause I think you'll need it."
R191YI42DJLHJ9,2,"I bought these for my husband.  Happy first father's day, I bought you a pair of crappy headphones. He's using them with his computer so as not to get distracted when working at home.  Firstly, they're kind of bulky.  The bar over the head is so oddly shaped, but he does have a small head. Then we plugged them in, it was easy to get going, but everyone in the room can hear what's going through the headphones.  Sound quality was good but definitely not discreet or  contained. The padding on the ears are flat rather than cupping around the ears, which relate to the lack of containing sound but also lends to being uncomfortable.  We gave up pretty early in so can't comment to the charging, batteries, etc."
R231GJ36WA7VIH,5,"These headphones solved a major problem in our household.  One person bothered by loud noise and the other person hard of hearing.  With the headphones, one person can enjoy TV or music at their desired volume and the other can read with the sound on mute or listen in at their desired volume.  We previously purchased this same headphone for a friend who resides in an assisted living facility.  He enjoys being able to listen to his TV or music without worrying about bothering the other residents."
RDXW09KJUHMP3,2,"I hated these as soon as I put them on.  They don't fit well and don't stay in place.  Try making dinner with these on -- you know, bending down to get pots and pans out of the lower cupboards and such...  These things fly right off.  And the ear fatigue is TERRIBLE!!  My ears STILL hurt.  Look at the profile of the ear pieces.  They're completely flat -- big flat panels pressed against your ears.  Really horribly uncomfortable.  No idea how these things got more than 3 stars...  I guess people just use them sitting down for short periods of time.  They still don't feel good, even for short term listening.  (Otherwise they're fine...  the radio works well and they charge and everything.)  But, I'm returning mine.  WAY too uncomfortable."
R1TO352ZUF7EQS,5,"Everything I read about these headphones is accurate and true. They are amazing.<br /><br />The sound quality is incredible and far surpasses that of my old headphones. The signal distance is super long. I can't believe how far I can go and still hear it crystal clear.<br /><br />My dad has a set and I have a set, and we each use a different channel. Then if he wants to watch something with me he just tunes his headset to my channel and boom, we are both listening to my tv. It's awesome.<br /><br />I do not like the positioning of the tuning dial... I would rather it NOT be on the same side as the volume dial (so there is less of a chance of bumping the tuning dial when adjusting the volume).<br /><br />The headset is a reasonable weight considering the size and that it contains batteries.<br /><br />Overall a great product and worth the price. It has completely changed my tv and gaming experience."
R2A7INPGMGNYT6,4,"After TONS of researching, I purchased this wireless headset for listening to the TV in another room (while cooking, cleaning, etc) while not having to blast the volume.  I've been very happy with the unit for a year now. The range is great and sound quality (for a wireless) is very good. Battery life has never been a problem.    Minor problems: After wearing it for an hour or two, it can get uncomfortable.  Also, when my house phone rings, there is a loud static sound coming from the earphones during each \\""ring\\"".  Every once in a while, there will be a constant stream of static - try turning toggling the ON/OFF switch on the earphones or pull the jack out & reinsert into your TV/receiver/stereo.     TIP: when placing on the recharging cradle (which I actually keep behind the TV, out of sight) make sure both sides of the earphones are extended to the same length. The charging light will not go on unless both sides are equally balanced."
R2YE0OEHW8CSNB,5,I am moderately hard of hearing and would have to have the TV sound set where it would be too loud for normal  hearing people. This thing takes care of that problem extreemly well. It is also good for when my wife goes to  the bed room and I stay up in the family room to watch TV a while. I can have the TV's volume turned all the way  down and still get whatever volume I want from the headphones..  The only con I see is that once in a while you get a short burst of static noise. But it is not enough to over ride  all that is good about it.
R7FHA41JM0QUH,5,I've purchased many wireless headsets over the years and have yet to find one that actually works.  Until now.  I just moved into a new home and the layout prohibits me from having a wired headphone going to the media center so I researched and decided on this one.    I don't want to rehash all the positive reviews because I agree with them all.  I set it up this morning and was able to go all through my house and out to the furthest point in my back yard (approx 150 feet or so) with great quality.    Very happy with these.
R3LXWRPGUZPKRD,3,"Generally happy with these, but they slip off when I bend over (and I have a very big head). The foam is flat where it intersects the ear, so there is no ridge to go around the ears and keep them in place. I will probably come up with a home-made fix for this, but it is annoying. The sound is decent for the price. Really good sounding headphones cost more, even for wired.  UPDATE: Still quite annoyed with looseness. Lowering to three stars."
R1GPSP4G3W7KXX,4,"Had the headphones for about a month now and have really enjoyed using them in our quiet work environment.  Range is really incredible.  As long as I don't mind looking like a dork walking around the office!!  Only complaint I have is the the earpads.  I really wish they were the \\""over the ear\\"" (earcup?) style, rather than just flat against the ear.  I'd feel better about increasing the volume a little bit.  Recharging and controls are really easy and I have had no problem using them for nine hours straight and not needing a recharge."
R96JQTXQYZ3LM,4,"This is the second set I purchased for my husband. Bought the first set for Xmas and they worked great, now bought a 2nd set for other TV. They're a lifesaver!!!"
R23RUVWI3K4O28,4,"The sound of the equipment is excellent. Controls are not easy , too small. If I bow the headphone will not hold in place.      Refer to the Sennheiser Wireless headphone RS 120  pURCHASED THRU AMAZON"
R245IA3YQFYF8Q,5,Has a range of about 600 feet as long as there is no building between you and the output. The sound is great
R1Q8BTP9CAL5TY,5,"Great Phones, what can I say .  Crystal clear and one can leave the room without compromising anything,  My House is 2 story 4000 sq feet,  Done, hear it any where, Wont be disappointmented. I came back and re-rated it after having used it for some time. I just had to give it a better rating.  Great price. I was Bar-b-cuing and was able to go outside and not miss a step in the movie."
R1DK8JREJG88S0,5,"I bought these headphones for my father, who is in a nursing home and is functionally blind. He loves to listen to NPR and PRN and also books-on-tape. I needed a headphone that was wireless, with good sound quality, good range and a very easy charging dock. For all of these qualities the headphones delivered without disappointment! With Dad's impaired vision and some slight dementia, he is still able to get the headphones on and off without incident, and the way the charging is accomplished through the wire hoop that acts as a stand/holder for the headphones was pure genius on the part of Sennheiser!  The range is good enough that he can not only listen anywhere in his room, but even as he roams the halls and the dining room! There are controls right on each headphone earpad , one for on/off and the other for volume control, which Dad has a little trouble with, but I am sure were designed to be discrete for the average user. It took a little training to get Dad to be able to find and use those switches.  Dad gets daily use out of these headphones and they have brought much enjoyment to his life.  Our only concerns were about accommodating his needs. The switches on the headphones are a little difficult for older, stiffer fingers, and the two LEDs on the Base unit are too small for him to see easily. But this was never designed to be a tool for the visually impaired so it's hard to really fault there.  The sound quality surprised me, and I may well buy another pair for home use for myself!"
R30U536GDKGNQW,4,"I was so pleased with the first one of this item, that I almost immediately bought another. It is very pleasant to be able to hear TV and movies  without disturbing everyone else in the house. My only complaint is the off/on switch; it is hard to move on each one I bought."
R2SRSC579UI0AT,1,"Got this headset for my wife so she could be more mobile & still listen to the TV while our baby is sleeping. Works great, she loves them but I see a few flaws. (1) they slide off your head really easy if you learn forward (2) the wireless signal control is located right next to the volume control which means almost every time i've gone to change the volume i end up changing the wireless signal control, which is annoying. (3) there are only 3 radio stations on the signal mount/emitter, why does the headset need a dial for only 3 station options?<br /><br />UP DATE:<br />The headphones stopped working less than a year from purchase. Not sure what the problem is, only used them infrequently and then one day... nothing. Would not purchase again."
R2RAIEV0ZQ4WK3,4,"Purchased for my elderly mom so she could watch TV without the neighbors 10 blocks away hearing her blasting TV.  It worked great. Tuning was easy, and to too heavy to wear."
R2YGU2PXP2RNZT,4,"I ordered these headphones because my husband needs more volume than do I.  They've been perfect for us during baseball games and for British DVDs that we rent.  I hate the crowd noise in sports but still want to listen to comments made by the sportscaster; that noise doesn't bother my husband at all, so he can have his headphone volume higher and we both can enjoy the games.  I don't have the technical knowledge to evaluate the headphones in that way.  I do know, however, that my husband had no difficulty in hooking them up to the TV and we've had no difficulties whatever with the sound production.  As noted, we use them only for speech on TV, not music.  I agree with reviewers that the headphones are not tight, but I believe we wouldn't want them that way for hours at a time of wearing.  We, too, have tried the reception from outside and have been very pleased with it, but we don't intend to wear them out of the house (just don't want to miss a home-run or who the Brit villain turns out to be in the movie).  They're perfect for our use."
ROFLOFVUNF10X,1,THESE HEADPHONES CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS.  WHEN WE TRIED TO RETURN THEM WE WERE TOLD BY AMAZON THAT THERE WAS NO RETURN POLICY WITH THIS COMPANY.  WE TRIED THEM WITH THREE DIFFERENT TV'S AND GOT NOTHING BUT STATIC.  WE WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANY PERSON.  DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH SENNHEISER OR AMAZON'S SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.  WE ARE OUT OVER $50 FOR A PIECE OF JUNK.
R2YNXYEMPR7LG4,4,Got this for my grandfather and he is hooked to this device. Watches TV for about 8 hrs a day and he is 91!! Need I say more?
R3D9S79ZEK7J8W,5,Needed a head set to use in our bedroom so that I could watch TV and ot wake up the wife or our new baby.  Tried several others that failed and this one WORKS!    Easy to install and set up.    Sound is really good.  A slight hiss at times but not over-riding on the experience.    I use this every night and it just works great!
R13NAO75WZ2F45,3,"Look, these headphones have some nice features and some not so nice features.  I'll list them out for you, you make up your own mind.<br /><br />Positive features-<br />Charging system- could not be easier.  Put headphones onto cradle.  Done.<br />Reception - at first I was getting lots of interference, I had to change the baby monitor to channel B, now they are crystal clear.  I sit 4 feet from a Wireless access point in my office and there isn't any issue.<br />Sound quality - they sound really good. Not spectaular, but good.<br />Sound Volume - no issues for me here, I have them plugged into a home theater amp and the is plenty of volume left to be raised.<br /><br />Negative features-<br />Comfort - the foam ear pieces are completly flat... not cupped like my Sennheiser HD590.  They sit ON your ear, not around them.<br />Base Auto Shutoff-  Shuts the base off after a few minutes of no sound.<br /><br />Regarding this last point... this maybe would make sense if the headphones themselves shut off if no audio was detected for 3 minutes.  In this situation, the BASE shuts off, leaving the headphones to happily drain battery life.  Why ?  and Why such a short time period?  Are we saving THAT much power?  Could they have let the base sit.. maybe 5 minutes? 10 even?  Enough time to grab a drink of water or something?  I don't know about you, but for me, the beauty of watching TV and movies at home is the simple fact that I CAN pause, take a break, check on the kids, answer an e-mail, then go back to the entertainment.  But leave these alone for 3 minutes and you'll return to the lovely HISSS of the base shutting off while the headphones are still on.  Then it takes a few seconds once pressing play, to get sound again.  So now you have to rewind a few seconds, or just miss some dialogue.  Stupid stupid auto shutoff feature."
R15BOFL2F3PHGF,1,"It did not work.  The base unit did not work when it arrived, very poor quality control."
RT1W97CA85XFF,5,"After receiving a letter calling me a stupid person, irresponsible, and other profanities from my neighbor. I decided  to purchase these headphones for barbequeing in. They have a great range and are built tough. I've dropped them several times on hard tile from about 6'. My elderly neighbors still don't wave at me or talk to me but they don't send me hate mail anymore. Some people just don't appreciate Pantera. These headphones will last about 16hrs on a single charge. They sound great and audio clarity is superb."
RHTN961A55SZZ,4,THis is a very good unit ir fits nice and being hard of hearing it bring the sound so realestic that I forget I have them on. the only objection I have is that if the soumd on the TV is not up far enougfh than you will have it on and all of a suddeb you get loud static. I had to callwhich was not toll free and talk to a tech and thats when I found out about the TV sound was to low. that shoud have been in the manual
R33V6ELBPYQ60N,1,"After charging batteries 24 hours AND PUTTING INTO SERVICE, I could not get the thing to function. The red lite worked for charging , the green light would not function to indicate a audio tranmission. I tried rebooting it by unplugging power supply, and removing batteries, but to no avail.  Batteries tested OK, all I received was static and a hissing sound.  Don M.  Galt Ca"
R6K7S6RIG6TWL,5,"I use them primarily for TV listening but I'm very happy with the performance, comfort, ease of use and setup.  Well priced for such a high quality item."
R1PLAUE0KVKBYV,5,Very good product. Listening quality is awesome. Charging station is cool. You just set it on there and it charges. You will not regret buying this.
R3BNP0NS4BSPRD,2,"I have used these headphones for about 5 months and pretty much hate them, here's why.    * the stand allows you to select 3 different discrete frequencies, but the headphones make you tune it in to the right frequency with an analog knob, which is awkward, imprecise and is always getting knocked when I adjust volume.  If there's 3 possible frequency settings on the base, there should be 3 on the headphones.    * after a minute of no output from your computer the headphones will generate static VERY loudly into your ears.  Apparently this is to save \\""battery\\"" life, I'm not sure how generating very loud static saves any battery life, and since all you need to do on your PC to start them up again is press play, so clearly it hasn't turned off the receiver.  If it went dead silent that would be fine, but generating static is annoying/pointless.    I'm not an audiophile, I don't care about the sound quality so much, I just want an easy to use pair of wireless headphones, this is not it."
R1HRX6MAET0LT2,1,So far I have a problem using headerphones. The green light connecting me with my tv disappears in a minute after I plug in and all I hear is a noise. I do not know how resolve this problem and I do not know where to get advise.
R3GKKWYS9IYM9,2,"very uncomfortable ear pads, I still use old set that has cut away for ears o/w good product"
RPV6ULB8PBQRB,5,I bought these refurbished for my grandmother who had trouble hearing the TV.  She loves them!
RVARGAFRX8IS4,5,"awesome, great sound, great range, I move around a lot at work and dislike my coworkers, this way I don't have to listen to them."
R3N6G6EPHGGR36,5,"My elderly mother wears hearing aids, but takes them off in bed when she watches television.  She is delighted with these headphones.  Her vision is poor as well as her hearing and she had a little trouble learning where the volume control was, but that was quickly mastered.  She says her ears do not sweat, she can now hear and understand even when the speaker has a slight accent, and she loves being able to go into her bathroom or kitchen and keep up with the dialog.  She has commented that she must stand up straight when walking around or the headphones do fall forward.  They have lost charge only once when she put them on the charging stand incorrectly. Her hearing aids are far inferior to this headset for television and music. She loves them and I have supplied over a dozen copies of Amazon's listing page as she has eagerly shared her pleasure with the set with many friends in her retirement community who also have hearing problems.  And when she visits me they come with her, making it possible for me to continue to work on my computer down the hall without having to share the audio of the programs she is watching.  I highly recommend these Sennheiser headphones."
R2PJ9YX3AOJO4O,2,"I got it 2 years ago and I didn't use it a lot, just once in a while. After couple of months the sound was interrupting from time to time and the sound quality was poor. Changed the batteries and nothing changed. The led on the base stays lit even if the headphones are off. This is not a good item to buy for sure."
R7C5JGK9S03CB,4,"Excellent product    Pros:  - good sound quality  - reasonable price    Cons:  - volume and tuning button are next to each other, so easy to choose wrong one. Minor flaw"
R2HJWJS8FV1M6J,4,"I got this wireless headphone to watch tv in quiet.  I even got 2 of these units so the wife can enjoy it as well.  They work great and each transmitter can be set to a different frequency while the headphones can pick up each signal separately.  The only drawback is one of them seem to be on the blink after a couple of years?  It could also be the new tv set I've installed it on?  Either way, I've enjoyed this model for the time that it worked perfectly."
R1BVLERLQ95KJS,4,"Good sound quality!!Distance capability not as far as claimed.  Well made product, easy to use, needs very little setup"
R2RWZ0T9U13VY,5,"Being a Senior Citizen, and not hearing too well, for more years than I can remember, I never had luck with headsets on my TV.  (this is, I think, my FIRST time writing a review, so bear with me please. And Only just used it, but had to write a review.)    My wife has her own TV, and even when I play my TV loud, I still can't make out words, so many years ago, my best guest would be in the 1990's, I bought my first Headset.  Not knowing if I should say where I bought them, a well known store, I won't mention them.    I bought so many from that store that I lost count.  I can't remember if they were 30 days or 90 days warranty.  All I remember was that right after the Warranty they just didn't work.  This went on for years and years, until in one of my magazines I get, I saw a re-conditioned headset, a Sony, and for $49.95 I bought that.  It had 2 year warranty, and for $2.00 more I bought another 2 year warranty.  I bought the Sony Headset, and reason I bought this new headset from Amazon was because the Sony one was starting to go.  By the way, the Sony headset lasted 7, at least 7 years.  If I had to put a downside to the Sony Headset, it was the cost of the batteries, they were expensive, but for 7 plus years I never had to replace those rechargeable batteries that only can be gotton from Sony.  Other than that, this particular Sony Headset WAS my best.  When I needed another headset after the 7 plus years, I went to Sony site first, looking for same one, but they don't make them anymore, and in short, the reviews were awful.  I checked Amazon on headsets I thought maybe were good, and even Amazon had terrible reviews.    Needless to say it took me a month or two to figure out the best headset for me. When I came across the one I got, the Sennheiser Cordless RS-120, the reviews were good,at least for me.  Another reason I thought they were best for me was because they were always out of stock when I tried to buy it at Amazon, and thought maybe these were good.I received headset yesterday, April 17, 2010.  I charged, as per directions, the batteries for 24 hours.  Even though I am just trying it, so far I can honestly say that this headset IS DEFINATELY the best, even better than the very old Sony I had, which is a good backup in case something happens to the Sennheiser RS120.    I was curious in reading the low reviews, meaning the distance.  I connected everything to my TV, and tested distance, and believe it or not, at least for me, I went outside, walked half way up the block and the signal was GREAT.  I would never need that distance, but good to know it goes far.      Because of my health condition, I'm limited on what I can do, which is watch TV, and DVD movies, and of course my computer, which is the 2nd reason I needed the headset.  1st reason, before getting headset years ago, was my wife yelling \\""turn down the TV please\\"".      I am extremely pleased and happy with the purchase of Sennheiser RS120.  In reading the 1 or 2 or whatever low stars, I'm only guessing that people expected much more, whether battery or distance, I just didn't understand why there were low ratings. RS120 has on/off switch, and even though for most people it could be a hassle turning it off when not in use for a while, but that's okay for me.  RS120, it says, 20 hours of battery use, my old Sony was 18 hours, but DID last longer.    For me, though, and I'm only talking about myself, the RS120 is, by far, the best headset I've head since early 1990's.    Even though I was spoiled spending the $49.95 for re-conditioned Sony that lasted so long, the price for RS120 was a little steep for me, but IT WAS WORTH IT. Once one reaches Senior Citizen, and especially the economy the way it is, I couldn't buy the headset that is maybe one step above in price.  Amazon, for me at least, is the best place to check all products out, and of course to buy products too.  I haven't found any place, other than Amazon, that I can buy products like books, products for our dogs', DVD's, etc. etc., than buying it from Amazon.    I hope my review is clear, and my review is based from 1990's on headsets, and at least for me, the RS120 is awesome.    I know it's only one day I've used RS120, but I don't think I'll have any problems at all.  Main thing is I can return it because of warranty.  Last point, in all the products I've bought, no matter what they were, from Amazon, we have never, ever, had to return anything we bought.    I thing that is saying something about Amazon.    Thank you all for reading my first review."
RGY9G2KE434DD,5,"I have had the Sennheiser RS-120 headphones for a month and find they are fine for TV audio. No distortion, they stay on my (bald) head and are comfortable. Those who complain of slipping must be bending over excessively. Replacing them on the charging stand is NOT a problem. Recommended."
R33KOY9BDJ7CEC,4,"ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THESE HEADPHONES FOR BEDROOM TV SOUND TO KEEP FROM DISTURBING OTHERS. I ERRONEOUSLY THOUGHT ALL TV'S HAD EARPHONE OUTLETS SINCE ANOTHER OLDER MODEL I HAD DID. MY BEDROOM TV DOES NOT. AM WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM. IN THE MEANTIME I AM USING MY RS120 SET TO LISTEN TO iTUNE MUSIC FROM MY COMPUTER WHILE I  DO CHORES IN MY APARTMENT. I THINK THE SOUND IS GREAT. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SOUND DISTORTIONS OF ANY KIND AS I MOVE AROUND. THEY SOUND JUST AS I HOPED THEY WOULD. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS SNUG ON MY HEAD AS I WOULD LIKE WHEN I AM MOVING AROUND. THIS WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM AT ALL IF I WERE USING THEM AS I ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR WATCHING AND LISTENING TO TV. NONETHELESS, I CONSIDER THEM A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND THEM.                                                  NM"
R1R1J04CUMVF9O,3,"These headphones are a bit expensive for what they offer. While the range is great, the sound is great, and the charging station is fine, the issue is interference. I'm not sure why, but I get a warbling beep every once in a while. Changing the different frequencies doesn't alleviate the issue and it doesn't happen all the time, but it is incredibly annoying when it does. I use my headphones about an hour a day and get a beep almost every time. The nice part about these headphones is the range and the fact that they aren't line of sight. As I said, when they work, they work great. One thing to keep in mind is that if there isn't a sound signal going to the transmitter you get static. All in all, decent headphones, but a bit overpriced for my experience."
R2X8T14V84NXV6,2,Did not set up and test this product. The headphones were too heavy and bulky for my elderly mother to handle.
R2IZW219ATUFFO,5,"THE GOOD:   I've owned these earphones for 1.5 years now.  I got them so I could hear the TV over the noise of my two young sons.  They worked like a dream and I loved being able to turn the TV volume down all the way during their nap time and be able to watch my shows at a high earphone volume and not wake them.  I am really thrilled that I can move around the house, do laundry, dishes, and still hear the TV without blasting everyone in the house.  My only dislike is that they are a bit big on my head so sometimes when I am moving around the house, I will add a knit hat over them to secure them better to my head.  But it is not a problem at all when I am sitting and watching from one location.    THE BAD:  The trouble began after we moved.  I thought maybe the new house had \\""interference\\"" that was causing the base unit power to suddenly shut off, causing the earphones to static in my ears at an unusually loud volume.    So I moved the base around to different areas around the TV hoping for improvement, to no avail.  My husband tried plugging them into various outlets behind the TV, Home Theater System, etc.  But I ended up giving up and put them away for months.      THE GOOD AGAIN:  One day I dug them out, really wanting to watch a movie without the distractions of my noisy house (er, boys).  I looked through the reviews on Amazon to see if anyone had figured out a fix to this problem.  Mostly I concluded that people gave up.  But since I knew that these earphones worked perfectly at our last house and NO electronic equipment had been changed, there must be a simple solution.  I got my husband involved (again) and after many tries at connecting the base into the home theater system into places where the earphone worked (and then later turned off and went to static) we eventually found the RIGHT place to plug them in and VIOLA!!!!  I've been happy . . . thrilled . . . even delighted every since.  And as an added bonus, my youngest son has been having trouble with his ears and will soon get tubes.  Until them, the earphones belong to him (otherwise he blasts us with volume since he cannot hear well)."
R1PP2WZF54UGN,3,"The headphones are way too loose and unless you keep head erect they slide or fall off. There should be something that could tighten the earcuffs so they do not fall off.  By the way, I do not have a small head.  For a woman I am on the large side.du"
R2S37RSHCPM5U9,4,"I wanted some wireless headphones that I could use on the treadmill so I could hear every word that was said on my t.v.and not have to miss out on the programs that I was watching while exercising. These headphones work really well. The only problem is that that I sweat a little bit underneath the headphones because the padding that gives them comfort also creates heat. Other than that, I am satisfied with the headphones and I can now enjoy watching t.v. while exercising without having to turn the volume way up on the t.v."
R1NF8PQL6C1J4R,4,"I purchased this item from Amazon for my father. He has a hard time hearing and they were just the ticket. Rarely did you ever see the two of them apart...you see Dad, you see headphones! My only complaint is that after a little over a year they have quit transmitting. My Dad misses them so much (since he has a hard time distinguishing words from background noises). Most likely, we will be purchasing another pair as these have been the ticket for him. They really did work, and work hard for the year + that he had them."
RWUQ85PRIF8J,2,"I won't go over too many details, since there are over 1000 reviews and I mostly agree with them.  However, I just wanted to weigh in on one flaw:  the \\""auto-off\\"" feature on the base causes these headphones to periodically blast the wearer with loud static if they stop listening to audio but continue to wear the headphones for a few minutes.  I find that I do this fairly often without really thinking about it, so this flaw is really annoying, even though it could have been very easily fixed in several different cost-efficient ways.<br /><br />Also, I don't think they fit especially well.  They're comfortable, but the parts that cover the wearer's ears are completely flat and can easily slide off if I tilt my head down.  No adjustments seem to fix this (as far as I know, I have a normal, non-mutant head, so this probably applies to others, too)."
R3FCM3A0GQQKOH,5,"The product is great, but if you don't know how to connect the headphones you will be very frustrated. The leaflet enclosed was in a lot of languages but lacked the essential info about how to connect it to the tv. I have a new Panasonic 42\\"" plasma and still can't get the headphones to work with regular tv. I can hook them up to my blu ray player and use the headphones for movie watching so haven't sent them back.   Updated info on connection to tv: I have a panasonic plasma hd tv and the only way to connect these headphones is to purchase a connector from digital audio to rca jacks plus a digital audio cable. The cost? more than the headphones my friends. Buyer beware unless you have an old tv."
RZTWZFBN16YOD,1,The product did not function after merely a week of use[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]
R260LALKHZKDMP,4,"The headphones are excellent in all respects, but are limited by the Part 15 wireless connection.  It is somewhat susceptible to noise, distortion if not properly tuned, RF dead spots, and so on.  Placement of the headphones on the charging cradle requires some fiddling, or the headset doesn't charge.  There's a light on the cradle to tell you when you have a suitable position."
ROFKI67WCWHCX,5,My only complaint is that the headset tries to fall off if I bend over......
R3JH0FAK7B99HG,4,"These headphones work very well, have great sound and reception is generally good. Maybe I should have read the manual (!?), but it took me a long time to figure out that these things will cut out and give a loud static noise when the volume of the device you're listening to (such as a TV) is turned off or down low. I guess it's to let you know the headphones are still on if you've turned off the TV, but left the headphones on. So, if you mute the TV, but leave the headphones on your head you might be shocked by the sudden loud static. If you have problems with reception, try changing the \\""channel\\"" on the charging base and/or adjusting the wheel on the headphones. When adjusted properly, I have very little problems with reception, even when walking around the house. Occasionally, I get some very faint interference, but if I move the headphones an inch one way or another it goes away. I'm very happy with the sound quality and comfort. They do fit \\""on top of the ear\\"" and don't lock onto your ears/head as well as I'd like, but that's my only gripe. I've had them for about 2 years."
R1ZARKEYAAGY17,5,"Gave this to my hearing-impaired father for his birthday, and he said it's the best present I've ever given him. He walks all over the house listening to news, has actually used it outside. I've tried it too, it's much more comfortable than the cheap headphones I'm used to."
R2CLXWO8BCFUTI,5,"I used another headphone for many years until it conked out.  It worked, but was marginal in providing understandable speech.  I bought the Sennheiser 120 as a replacement based on reviews listed by other users.  When I first put it to use it was WOW, what a difference.  I have had the new headphones about a month, now, and I am still amazed each time I use them at the clarity of the sound, especially speech.  My old ears are dancing to a new tune!  Jim F"
R14G8N4WO973WL,1,The headphones sit on a charging bar when not in use.  After two month the charging bars has become corroded to the point that the silver-colored plating is flaking off and the underlying metal is exposed.
R1E4LZMKL1PU4M,5,My 90 year old Grandpa is very hard of hearing from the war and he really enjoys this.  He can walk through the house and still hear the TV.
R2DOK5CIRTGS7S,2,"Terrible.  When I connect the cradle to my TV, I get lots of static on every channel.  The static is much louder than the actual sound of the program.  I am returning it."
RB44LV3YIZB0A,3,"I read the other reviews before ordering Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle   Was so hopeful an 84 yr old very hard of hearing friend living with us- could use these.  He is very alert and love technical things- but, the headphones just arent versatal enough for all we need to use them for.  We needed something for not only tv, but the DVD player/ VCR player which are all hooked into an entertainment center.   It appears each time a change is needed from one to another, we have to move the furniture around to change the plug to the unit to each item different item. We had also hoped to be able to put them to the Computer so he can listen to it, which they do work, but always have to keep changing the plug.  when needed.     Yes,we can change the plug to the earphones EACH time, but what a bother!  We need ONE thing to be able to do all.  We are still looking.   Going to have to get a special bookcase by him for all the electronics needed, if we dont run out of money first.  Also, the headphones get very warm when using."
R3TDSX1XXDMURA,4,"I've only had these headphones for a couple weeks and haven't had the time to tinker with some of the reception issues mentioned below so keep that in mind.    Sound quality with music playing is really good.  There is a hiss and buzz (interference to signal?) when initially turned on.  As a result, I question whether or not they would work for classical music.    Another issue I have seems to be a waiver in the signal when listening.  Music will occassionally fade in and out, not significantly but noticeably if you're really listening.  Once again not sure if this is a base placement factor or inherant in the product.    Otherwise, they are great to wear while working out though I do wonder about how sweat will affect the ear cushions.  Bass is very good and sound can be really chrisp depending on the production quality of the cd being listened to.    All in all, I would say I'm satisfied given what was paid for these headphones and I'd recommend them for casual listening to music or for the convenience of listening to music louder than you could with speakers while still being able to move freely around.  The 300ft distance seems accurate"
RGES0SJSZDK0W,4,"These are great.  Great sound, and picks up better sounds than my surround sound system. The only reason I would not give this 5 stars is that it falls off my head sometimes.  There are just a bit wide and I have a conical aka egg shaped head. and the other reason is that you can't just turn off the base when not in use.  Once it picks up an audio signal it will turn on, even if you are not using the headphones.    For the price, it really can't be beat."
R1B8HY8DWTMXNX,5,"I purchased this wireless headset mostly based on the reviewes of previous buyers, and to my surprise I'm happy I did. The headset has excellend sound quality, the reception is good even as far as 50 feet away from the transmitter. I had this unit for about 2 months now and it has worked as advertised every time. Occasionally when I walk away from the source sound and place the tv on pause I get a low hiss in my ears but as soon as I turn the tv back on the recetion is again very good. Oh one added bunes and if you are nosy like me at times I can hear the phone conversation from my next door neighbor when they speak on a wireless phone. Overall a good product I would recommend it to anybody."
R2TXTGNKWF35ZW,1,"I have had these headphones for about 2 years now. It was working OK. Yes, there was some hiss, but it was tolerable. Then, out of the blue, the transmitter just died. No, it was not a receiver battery issue. NO matter what sound source I connect it to (and I have tried a few different ones to be sure), the green light on the transmitter won't turn on, and the unit just won't transmit.    I expect something like this to last for WAY more than 2 years. Shame on Sennheiser for a poor quality product."
RYCTTU3P4HQX5,5,A Simple solution to all those negative reviews>Read & follow the step by step instructions.  Product works great w/ my 10 yr old JVC receiver & new Panasonic Plasma & my Rocket-fish wireless speaker set up
R2TVCI9U5DLCMX,1,"I'd been in the market for a set of wireless headphones for over a year; I researched the product; I read other reviews. When I saw the 50% off sales price on this Sennheiser unit I told myself, \\""wow; I can finally afford a pair of these things.\\""      I ordered.  They were delivered promptly, in a new, never before opened package.  Here's what I found and how I rate the product:    Instruction materials:  Very Poorly done.  For example, on the battery charger, transmitter unit, there is a switch on the bottom of the front of the unit.  The switch has a barely visible left, center and right toggle for apparently opting for 1 of 3 positions.  However, nowhere in the instructions is there either a picture of the switch nor any information about what the switch is for.  Is this an on-off switch?  Is this a channel choice switch?  Is this a transmission frequency switch?  Is this just a play switch that really does nothing except...?    Battery Charging Cradle:  Very Poorly created.  One must position the unit with extreme precision and ensure the charging unit/transmitter rests on a flat, level platform where even the slightest vibration say from footsteps of a passer-by won't jostle the units off center thus aborting the charge operation.    Sound Quality:  Fair to Good, but only when and while the transmission of the sound was in fact working.    Transmission: Very Poor.   These are wireless units that, when properly installed (easy to do following the booklet from the TV company, not so following the Sennheiser literature)and working allowed me to listen to tv programming.  Problem is...sound continued to be delivered sporadically...intermittently.  For no reason I could ever identify, transmission was start/stop seemingly without cause.  Then, again without cause...silence!      Over several days, I tried using the headphones.  I was never able to listen to more than a few lines of dialog of a program before the units shut off and went silent.  A few times, the silence was preceded by nearly ear-drum bursting screeching sounds.      I thought at one time all of this might have been a result of the failure of the batteries to properly recharge so I went out and bought new batteries.  The fully charged, new batteries made no difference in performance."
R224M0G91NC144,5,"My husband and I both work at a desk in the living room of our home.  It's difficult to get work done without the headphones.  I got these as a present for my husband and he likes them.  They are big around the ears but they are very comfortable.  There aren't any hard spots around the ears and the reception is great.  It makes me feel like I'm in an office with the door cracked.  Only negative... when the portable phone rings, the reception goes away and you hear a buzzing sound in your ears.  It doesn't do it except when the hand set is ringing."
R24A8VDBYWEU6W,5,"I purchased this particular product after reading the reviews of most of the other wireless headphones on Amazon. I was particularly interested in the range and being able to recharge the headset. The range has impressed me. I walked outside the full length of our driveway and was still able to get decent reception (when plugged into the pc).Recharging is very simple, just set them back on the cradle. No wires to connect at all.<br />My son loves to use them when playing his video games and I use them streaming music late at night. They have a good volume range and good sound clarity with my classical music.<br />I have noticed that the headphones tend to pick up my neighbors' cell phone conversations. These are easily tuned out, but be  aware if you live in close quarters.<br />The headset is very comfortable to wear, even over several hours. The extra weight takes a little getting use to, but they are well balenced so this wasn't an issue.<br />Overall, I would say that this was a very good investment of my money.<br />  ***** Consumer Note: Check the condition of the batteries in the headphones frequently! After using them for nearly two years, one of the batteries leaked and corroided the wiring. It's easy to forget about the batteries because we'd just set the headphones back in the cradle when we were through. The headset was ruined and we didn't think to check on the warrenty until it was too late."
R25TM0S6JUKFKD,4,The headphones work very well I can walk downstairs to the kitchen and hear when the commercials are over. They are pretty comfortable my only complaint is when I lean forward they slip off my ears. For the price I paid I would recommend them to a friend.
R19CA950H0J3B9,5,"A few years ago I purchased an expensive Panasonic wireless setup which recently failed completely.  I searched for a replacement, and wanted something less expensive.  I hear fine, but my wife likes to read and the TV sound intrudes.  I read dozens of reviews, and can now say that the most positive ones about this unit reflect my experience.  I was disappointed however in being able to know exactly what came with my purchase in reading about this system, so I'm going there for prospective buyers like me who like details.  I have submitted a picture of what came in the box.  The cradle/transmitter; the earphones; recharchable AAA bateries; power cord; extra connectors for different situations: (see picture); instructions in several languages.  Built into the cradle/transmitter and coming out of the bottom, is the RCA red and black audio cord which plugs into the audio out on your TV or cable box etc. to which you choose to plug in.  The power cord plugs into a little opening on the bottom of the cradle/transmitter which was tricky for me.  However, once you plug in your done.  I charged the batteries on my own charger which took about 30 minutes, and started using the unit.  Considering the cost, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound.  It took me a few seconds to turn the tuner on the earphones and get the best quality, and after that I was done.  I plugged the audio cords into my Comcast cable box because my plasma TV is mounted over my fireplace, and it would be a chore to take it down to plug into the audio out, even though that's probably the most convenient.  If I want to listen to my DVD player, I have to take the 15 seconds or so to disconnect from the cable box and connect to the DVD player, a minor inconvenience.  I ran my own audio tests listening to various shows and music and was very pleased with the sound.  All in all I can recommend this unit, and have had zero problems with it."
R28IVEVWJ5QGMX,5,i have tryed so many but i think this is the one best so far
RHUWXTKP4ADWT,1,"Ordered on 1/31 and after a two weeks I was informed that their \\""outside\\"" vendor ran out of them and could not fulfill the order.  After a small hassle we were able to get our money back and then reordered them in the middle of Feb from Amazon itself.  Amazon said it will ship them when they get them in stock, possible as far out as April.  Can't say anything about them if I don't have them - thus the 1 star for the problems we have had in even getting them."
R2D5I9BXV455JT,2,"IMO, headphones costing close to a hundred dollars ought to last for more than a year.  The price made me think it was higher quality than it was.  That attitude made me a sucker, because my headphones died after several months.  The wiring inside it has such a small diameter, it wears out in no time. My headphones short-circuited one day, ceased to charge up, quit picking up any sound, and finally went dead. An examination of the wiring showed me it was little better than filament wire. Can't they afford to beef up the wiring so the device will last awhile?"
R2MT71USD03U34,5,"I got these headphones on sale and I am very pleased with them. They have weird problems though. The fit is lousy. They fall off if you lean forward even a little. I use a stretchy headband to keep mine on. The volume dial and the tune dial are on the same side and it is really easy to use the wrong dial when adjusting the volume. The headphones lose the signal but it isn't very difficult to get it back. It's just annoying. I tried using regular alkaline batteries and they work great. I wear my headphones for seven or eight hours at a time. The alkalines lasted three days before I decided to switch back to rechargeables. I prefer to use rechargeable batteries, but I take them out of the headphones and charge them separately. The headphones don't fit on the charging stand all that well and the charging indicator light always stays on. Better to be safe than sorry! The range on these things is fabulous. The sound quality is excellent. The headphones come with lousy written instructions. You need an internet connection so you can go online and see how to set everything up. I love these headphones though and plan to buy another set in the near future."
R1DU05O0KIK9Q0,5,"I purchased this product after going through 3 iterations of the similar Sony wireless head phones. The Sony's always had terrible interference and therefore sound quality. The Sennheiser sounds great 99.9% of the time, with a just rare scratchy noise, which is to be expected with wireless. Fit is great, convenience of charging is great, and they look great in the living room. The only issue I've had is laying my head on a pillow may sometimes cause the tuning dial on the back of the ear piece to get moved, but it rarely happens and is not a big deal."
R39I0RC28JJF87,4,the only negative thing about these headphones is the fit.when looking down they slide off.
R1FQ7QWLBLNJOJ,3,"I tried it for a few days, but returned today.<br /><br />First, the positive:<br />1) great sound quality when watching TV<br />2) range was pretty acceptable. Could go to the kitchen or bedroom and still get a very decent signal from the living room.<br />3) very comfortable in general. Your ears will get a bit too hot after extended periods, but hey, it's headphone! (of course leather would be better than cloth, but it'd be >$200 like the Bose). If you wear glasses it'll require a bit of adjustment so it doesn't put too much pressure on your glasses over the ears.<br />4) Battery seems to last enough. I used for several hours and still going strong. My Xbox batteries gave up much before the headset.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 3-stars and the reasons for my return are:<br /><br />1) It DOES HAVE a constant hiss in the background. Differently than most other reviews I found it quite noticeable, especially on interviews and dialogs, or  when your music has frequent level changes like classic music, jazz, etc. I'm using to play RPG games on my Xbox, so your mileage may vary. As RPG games have lots of dialogs and parts with subtle music mixed with high intensity action, any small interference gets *very* annoying after a few hours.<br /><br />2) Also noticed there's an audible high pitch noise when the xbox is loading something from the DVD. Again, it's only noticeable during silent parts, but when you're playing Mass Effect 2 that's pretty much the entire time. I tried moving away the xbox and using shielded cables but no improvement. Also tried adjusting the frequency on the headphone and changing the station without luck.<br /><br />In summary, when watching regular TV or other source with constant high sound the automatic gain control will work fine and you can barely notice the hiss. If you're planning to play videogames (specially RPGs) or other sources with long pauses and subtle music, maybe you should look for something else."
R11FU3XZDWMOVX,5,"These were purchased for the bedroom, where one person has to get to sleep before the other. The headphones provided the perfect solution: lightweight with excellent sound reception and reproduction, they allow unimpeded viewing pleasure while the other person has the quiet needed. Recommended!"
RRQRM2YM2PA59,3,Comfortable with good sound quality.  The only complaint is the positioning on the recharging cradle can be tricky.  But it seems to have improved a bit lately.  It pleases a very picky person who is accustomed to very high quality sound...
R1DBPJ4G8HQ6I4,5,"I couldn't be happier with these headphones!  They were easy to hook up, they charged easily, and the sound quality was much better than expected.  I'm not a highly technical person so I didn't feel the need to spend $100+ on a set of headphones.  I simply wanted to listen to the tv in bed without my husband asking me to turn the volume down to the point of muting the tv all together.        I have not had the problems with static that other people have reported.  I even have the base unit on the shelf where the dvd, alarm clock, cell phones, and other items are plugged in and/or charging.  I also don't have a problem with range because I'm only using them to watch tv in bed.      If I had to change one thing, I wish the headphones cupped around your ears to block out background noises - in my case an air purifier.    For the price I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend them to others who will use them as I do.  Good luck!"
R18N7DSNNZ6M0T,3,"So far I've yet to find the sweet spot when tuning in to a channel that allows for a normal to high volume level that doesn't have static.  When you tune off the channel a little the static goes away, but the sound gets muted some, like its being played through a pillow.  When its tuned in to the channel the quality of my music is good, except for the constant, faint hiss of static.  Tuning off a little drops the static completely, but the bass, mid and vocals sound like someone is playing music in the room next to you through a wall.  I've not had a chance to fully test the range of the product as I bought them for use at my desk at work.  I hate having to take my headphones off when walking to the water cooler or grabbing some papers off the far end of my desk.  The max range I sit from the transmitter is 3-6 feet, so reception should be perfect, but its not.  As far as comfort, they do feel good but don't hug my head very tight and can come off easily if you lean over to pick up a pen or something off the floor.  The tuning wheel on the right side is in an easy place to bump when trying to adjust volume, the two wheels should have been reversed so volume was lower instead of the tuning.  I love Sennheiser head phones, I bought these to replace a pair of HD497s that I've been rocking out with for almost 9 years.  I should of had my HD497s repaired instead of buying these, but hind sight is 20/20."
R1EB9SLA0JBWK,5,"I've been using these for about 3 months now and they're excellent.  The audio quality is better than the factory speakers that came with my television (which actually weren't too shabby).  I've never had an issue with battery life, though I rarely use them for more than 5 hours or so without a recharge.  Perfect for watching a late night movie while the spouse/kids are sleeping, or for playing loud video games without disturbing the rest of the household.  Rarely I get a tiny bit of interference, but it's short duration (under a second) and not really distracting.    The headphones are comfortable even for extended use.  My only (very mild) complaint is sudden head movements can dislodge them fairly easily.  For stationary use however you can't do much better than these."
R120USC89AJO1,1,"6 months in and the headphones have failed. After sporadic use totalling maybe 50 hours.    I can use them for perhaps 30 minutes before all I get is static. Then, if I turn them off and put them back on the charging stand, they'll be good to use for maybe another 30 minutes after about 2 hours.    Absolutely not worth the money for this."
RPCZ6VTJQ89C4,5,being a long time user of Sennheiser products i am really pleased with this middle of the range headset for the TV.the service was excellent. thank you R.Davies
R9HMZJ0W89I5K,4,"This product has a good quality, it is easy to use and nice to listen to. The buzzing when you activate a remote and the sound loss if you turn your head is quite annoying. I have expected a much beeter quality product for the amount of cost from a premier produced at Sennheiser. I am quite disappointed in the ease at which youlose channel and the flat foam ear covering. Very cheap in my boook. It cahrges nice and it easy to install. There are many techiical issue whisch could be improved to make the comsumer life better."
R24I1WLS3D5BZM,5,"since this purchase my wife,  not  me,  goes up an down with the  volume  but  mine  never changes  i take them off for comercials  to cool down,  i get the swets  due  to  meds."
R1KPHAPIE12BRX,1,"I had realistic expectations of my new headphones. Big disappointment with the fit. I bought these for watching/listening to t.v., while I cleaned the house. They wouldn't stay on my head! The ear pads are flat and don't provide any grip on your ears. Everytime I bent over, they slid off. I don't have a small head, and a friend with a big head tried them, and the same thing happened to him. Adjustment options were minimal. Reception was also spotty through my walls, reaching a high pitch screech at times. I packed them up today and am expecting a replacement headphone from a different company. Yeah, I don't recommend these headphones. I am disappointed and just plain annoyed with the hassle of dealing with the return."
R3V2PTFAE4U38O,5,"I use the RS120 headphones to watch TV while my wife reads. The sound is very clear and the headphones are comfortable to wear. For me, this was a great buy."
R25Y8DP3AKS7UL,4,the only issue I had is with installing. My 3 month old Panasonic Plasma 50 inch tv doesn't have headphone jack. It took me over an hour to figure out that I need to plug RCA cable into cable box and not the TV. Now all works great. I got them for one kid not to wakeup the other .....so far all are happy!
R212TJAK06G9D1,5,Works so well I hardly notice mom and dad are up watching tv. works so well dad gets sleep while mom stays up watching her shows.  Dad makes breakfast with it (mind you the tv it is connected to is in the living room) on so he doesn't miss a thing. a wonderful investment.
RWWE6ULFP4U6N,2,"I went into this purchase with my eyes opened, so I blame myself mostly; but I figured that with all the good reviews that perhaps those witting the bad reviews were exaggerated or perhaps they simply got that 1 in 100 defective item. However, as others have said, the base station shuts off if it doesn't detect audio. Well, if that were all it was, I would deal with it. However, when the base shuts off EVEN WHEN THERE IS audio, thus producing the ear drum shattering static, it becomes unacceptable! I use my wireless headphones on my computer to watch DVDs and online movies in bed and the base station will \\""go out\\"" in the middle of a conversation; so I know there is audio. In order to get the base station to come on again, I have to get up, shut the headphones off, place them back on the cradle wait a couple of minutes, pick them up, turn them back on and MAYBE they will again be working. Unfortunately for me, I already threw the box away so I won't be returning them. However, I won't be wasting my money of Sennheiser products again and because I paid less than [...] for them, perhaps I got off lucky.<br /><br />The range is likewise less than optimal. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment (approx 1,000 sq ft). Static is heard while even in the same room as the base and if I walk into the kitchen from the bedroom... forget it; the static is so bad it becomes too difficult to understand the conversations taking place on the DVD I am attempting to listen to.<br /><br />I've never encountered the problem some have mentioned concerning the discomfort on the ear pads as I have not been able to keep them on my head long enough to see if the pads become uncomfortable.<br /><br />But other than that, these headphones are fine. If you need a paperweight or want to decorate a room, then these are perfect. However, if you want to listen to music or movies, perhaps you should look elsewhere."
R21Y8L0XAB2NEQ,4,"The headphones are good. The only problem noted is that they can be disturbing to your partner if the volume is set slightly above the minimum, specially in bed.  The outside noise should be limited somehow."
R21OO93H3AZW2G,4,"The headset needs to be placed on the charger just right, but overall it seems great. You can't beat it for the price. Nothing flashy, but works as described."
RJ5PT4PL9P62I,1,"Lots of static sound with these.....I have tried playing around with the settings for hours, but not matter what channel I use I get static, and if I move my head slightly it changes.  Even worse, sometime when I'm listening it will suddenly stop sending music, and instead sends load static noise at full blast which can damage my ears!    On the plus side they are fairly comfortable, look good, and have good battery life, but what is the point if they can't even produce sound properly.    I live in an apartment building so perhaps there is interference with other people?    Anyway I would stay away and spend a little more money on a pair that actual works (I'd recommend digital rather than analogue)"
R3TOR9NQQI6R5V,5,I researched wireless headphones for about a week before buying these.  These make it possible to watch tv and not wake the baby.  My wife was not thrilled about them due to the fact I already tune her out a lot during tv.  Installation is simple.  Just plug them into the rca jacks on the back of the tv.  My tv has a speaker on and off setting that is a pain.  The headphones will not pick up a signal from the tv unless I manually turn this on and off.  That is an issue with the tv though.  I was expecting the ear foam to be a little softer than what it is.  Its a firm foam rather than the soft molding foam you would expect from an expensive headphone.  The signal is excellent in the same room but does have some static when walking around the house or when the microwave is on.  I chose these headphones over the sony brand.  I have heard from friends that the sony headphones are not as good when it comes to interference.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Amazon had the cheapest price I could find on this model.  A+
R2304RNOJ8GK5T,4,Let me say first I am not an audiophile. I mainly use these for my TV and iTunes on my Mac. The sound is very good and well balanced. I haven't had the hissing problems some seem to have and wear them more than I anticipated. They are great for my living situation which is not wanting to bother my neighbors as I have pretty thin walls in my apartment. I can crank them up with no worries.  As others have mentioned I agree with the fact that they have a very flimsy fit and it's very true you can't bend your head down without them wanting to fall off. I didn't have the option of being able to compare fits with other headphones and purchased them merely on other reviews. If I had to do it again I think I would have gone for the RS 170's. but I am very pleased with these. The sound is very good and full. Sennheiser has a great reputation and the price was hard to pass up but the extra $150 for the rs 170's may have been worth it. I just wish I could have done a side by side comparison.  If you are sitting upright and not moving around much I highly recommend these. I use them watching blu-rays on my Sony and feel like I am in a theater environmant.
R11SPS65AVMMCH,4,"I've only been using this gadget for a little more than a week.  Overall I'd rather have it than not.  Here are my comments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o  Wireless<br />o  Easily recharged (I would have regretted getting one where I had to remove the batteries to recharge -- a pain)<br />o  When tuned to frequency (see cons below), the sound quality is good enough for me but I'm not fussy.<br />o  My purpose was to watch TV late at night without disturbing my wife -- it works for that.<br /><br />Cons:<br />o  When I walk around with it on I get pops, snaps & static.  (When lying still this rarely happens.)<br />o  It doesn't lock on the frequency of the sending unit.  You have to manually tune it to the frequency, and the tuning is sensitive/fussy. Once tuned to frequency it stays on frequency until the tuning wheel is moved.  But, the tuning wheel is easily moved.  When I lay the headset on the bed the tuning wheel often gets bumped/moved requiring it be readjusted.  The tuning wheel is near the volume wheel.  When intending to adjust volume you may mess up the tuning instead.<br />o  The ear pads are continuous cloth (no open area over the ear canal), so the pads can become a little warm.<br /><br />Followup:  I have now used it almost nightly for over two years and I am glad I bought it.  Everything I said in my review above is accurate, but if the review sounds negative that would be a wrong impression as I am happy with the unit."
R21V44DUVHW3KN,4,"Some people complains of hiss. At the beginning I had the same problem but switching in the base to the channel in the middle or the one at the right solved the problem completely. The sound quality is very good and more than enough for TV or movies. The recharging base is quite practical as you just leave the headphone dangling on the chrome holders an that´s it.    Mine came with RCA connectors and an adaptor for stereo mini plug and the bigger plug as well.    In my experience headphones require some hours of use before they start to sound at its full potential. So maybe some people didn´t like the sound at first but I am sure that after some hours the bass becomes more present and the sound gets fulller.    I used to have a wireless infrared headphonesbefore and they were a bit annoying as sometimes when moving my head caused noise and of course I could not leave the room. The range of the Sennheiser RS120 is exceptional as it covers my entire house with no hiss or distortion at all.    On the other hand they leak sound so they are not so quite to anybody close to you but anyway, the sound being leaked is way lower in volueme than the normal sound of the TV with no headphones. So it is a very good improvement after all."
R6TYNWTUBD04Z,1,"While this headset is made by a highly rated manufacturer, the quality of the product is less than stellar. They are of a high quality build, but operationally deficient.  We had a difficult time tuning the headset with my TV, which was the only reason I bought it. The transmitter was within 6' of the headset, but that made no difference. Got a lot of Ham Radio interference and they just plain didn't work for me.    Too bad."
R12NJMJ5IRZTOU,5,"I work midnights and have both in-laws living with me with these headphones I can enjoy TV without closed caption or music at a level I can enjoy, they also allow my wife to watch TV while I am sleeping.  They have worked out great."
R1JCQF8B0AIOI7,5,We purchased these to use when we are on the treadmill so TV does not need to have volume so loud. They work fabulous. We tried another brand but had to return them. I would highly recommend these to everyone. They tune in with ease and accuracy. The volume control is easy to adjust. If you are looking for wireless headphones do not hesitate to consider these.
R1EBJA798ZY1RB,5,"I got wireless headphones to allow me to watch TV and play video games after the family has gone to sleep/before they get up.  For this purpose they are excellent.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  I was able to hear sound effects in games that I didn't realize were there!  They remain connected throughout my entire house without interference and were easy to setup.<br /><br />It did take a little feng shui to position the base unit away from the entertainment center for a clear signal.  Also, I find the quality of sound the best if I turn the source volume up high and the headphone volume low."
R2HZUITYP7MF1X,5,"These headphones are great! The sound quality is spectacular. They have a fine presence to go along with a good bass response. I use them on the treadmill. I usually watch CNN, so when the commercials come on, I shift the phones off of my ears a bit to give my head a break. Not that the headphones are that heavy, it's just good to let your ears breathe from time to time. I have worn them upstairs with no loss of signal. When the weather warms up, I'm going to see if I can listen to them while fishing on my pond! I highly recommend these headphones to anyone."
R1MTACYQN1CK6Y,4,This is the 2nd set I bought-we use it mainly for TV but sound quality is excellent  for music also. All in all a good product and I highly recommend it.Gave 3 stars for comfort but had a case of shingles that left my one ear very sensitive to pressure and so 3 stars (for comfort)is probably not fair to the product
R3U0HFS75MI8A0,4,"I got the headphones for my wife so that she could run on the treadmill and not have to crank the volume on the TV up so loud that I could here it upstairs. Overall, she is very pleased with the reception and sound quality. The only issue that she has had is that they tend to slide off when she bends over, for instance, to tie her shoes. Other than that, all is well. Very happy with purchase."
RKQTK0LM6I3DO,5,I bought this as one of my husband's Christmas gifts.  He absolutely loves it!  thank you...thank you...thank you
RXITDYKILKX1S,5,Perfect. Got them for my mom to replace a pair that broke and these are far better.Now my dad is happy that the TV isn't turned up all the way.
R51XEF2FQIQQK,5,My husband had been wanting wireless headphones for a while and so this was his Christmas gift.  He really is impressed and has nothing but great things to say about them.  I think I am going to get some for upstairs also.
RD2LNM5UY7ZF,5,"I bought the Sennheiser RS120 wireless RF headphones for my wife so she could watch television into the wee hours of the morning without keeping me awake, and they're working perfectly for that.  When we first unboxed the headphones I spent a few minutes trying to figure out the best way to connect them to the TV in the bedroom.  We have a Sony LCD TV on the wall, and the headphone jack in in the back.  So I knew I wouldn't be able to plug the headphones directly into the headphone jack.  The best solution was to plug them into the line out of the cable box.  Because audio and video is delivered to the TV via HDMI cable, it's a simple matter of switching the audio output on the cable box menu from HDMI to \\""other\\"".  Two clicks with the cable remote and the TV is muted and delivering sound only to the headphones.    The angle of the earpieces is a little awkward and tends to get uncomfortable after a few hours.  I watched an entire movie using the headphones a few nights ago and I found I had to take them off to give my ears a break.  The size of the earpieces also requires some creative adjusting if you plan to lay down with the headphones on.  Overall, however, the sound is great and these headphones are still WAY more comfortable than those annoying ear-bud styles.      I also tested the range after we hooked them up and I was able to go from the second floor bedroom all the way to the laundry room in the far corner of the basement before I experienced any signal degradation.  In the summer I'll walk around outside and test the range, and I suspect it will be pretty far."
R3BXS5ECSJ5ABC,4,"So far, these headphones have performed as hoped.  i can listed to the TV in our bedroom with the lights out and my husband can sleep in a quiet room."
RXUVZLKFP00NY,4,"The sound quality is wonderful. I would enjoy them more if they were more comfortable to wear. They are hard on the ears, so I can't wear them for long. They are flat and non-cusioned. This also causes them to slip off if I tilt my head back or forward too far. The controls are really pretty easy to use, once you get used to the location. The battery and reception hold up well. I also like the charging cradle. Easy to know when placed correctly and charging."
R34IVZLGQPWG3Y,5,"This is one awesome product!  Excellent sound quality, reception, and ease of use.  You can even leave the power switch on the headset in the on position while it charges on the stand.  Love them!!"
R1ZRSEOPEET8CA,2,"I bought this wireless headset for watching TV or playing video games while my wife is asleep.  It's a noble idea, but I now get the impression that you have to spend >$200 to get a decent pair.  These had a few qualities that I didn't like, and one that I absolutely HATED.  The minor things: in short, they didn't fit.  The part that fits on your ear is flat, and angled odd, so it doesn't stay on your ear if you lean over and it tended to slide forward even while sitting upright.  The sound quality was OK, but there was a constant low tone \\""hum\\"" the entire time they were on.  The major thing: the auto on/off switch in the transmitter.  I can't stress enough how annoying this is.  This is the main reason I decided to return these.  The transmitter would turn off automatically while I was using them, followed by a loud annoying static sound.  This would happen every 5-10 minutes, and last for about 30-60 seconds.  I first thought that I just needed to turn the audio source up more, but that didn't fix it.  It seemed purely random.  I then switched channels (there are three to choose from on the transmitter) and tuned the headphones accordingly.  Same result.  I checked to see if the microwave was in use, or any other transmitting electronics in the house were in use, but nothing was.  Instead of playing detective for any longer, I decided I had enough.  $80 should get you more than this inconvenience.       The good: the charging stand was really easy to use.  you could practically throw the headphones onto the stand and it would charge.  I just can't see why anyone would have a problem with that feature.  Also, the range was good.  The same (mediocre) sound quality was delivered at 5 feet to 50 feet in my house.      My solution: I bought a 20' 1/8 jack extension cord instead.  I'll use my in-ear phones with the extension and know that I'll be able to hear my media w/out interruption.      Recommendation: either spend $150-250 on wireless set, or just get a long extension chord for your existing phones."
R352CKSR0NROV2,5,I purchased these wireless headphones as a gift for my wife who likes to listen to music and movies very loud.  She loves them and wears them every evening.  She can listen to whatever she wants from any room in our house as loud as she wants.  Great product.
R1EL00BHXUGAWP,5,"This was a gift from me to my husband who has a hearing disability.  I was unsure if he would use them or not.  Well, he loves them.  He said he is able to hear what is being said on TV like never before.  One night he was so excited because he heard background music that he never knew existed.  Now when we sit down to watch TV I reach for his \\""ears\\"" and we are both happy!"
R2P48A27J83RP5,5,"I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW THESE THINGS WORKED SO I BORROWED A DIFFERENT BRAND AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE,THEY WERE CALLED TV EARS. THE RECEPTION RANGE WAS HORRIBLE, I COULDN'T EVEN GO INTO MY KITCHEN WITHOUT STATIC, AND I HAVE A SMALL HOUSE. SO I SHOPPED AROUND ON LINE AND FOUND THESE. I READ THE REVIEWS AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD SO I GAVE THEM A TRY. THEY ARE GREAT. I HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR 3 MONTHS NOW AND THEY HAVE MADE MY EVENING TV WATCHING SO NICE. I WENT OUTSIDE AND WALKED ALL AROUND THE HOUSE WITH THEM AND THE RECEPTION WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THEM IS THAT I WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALLER AND FIT A LITTLE MORE SNUG ON MY HEAD, OTHER WISE THEY ARE GREAT AND EVERONE GETS A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP. THEY WERE ON SALE ALSO FOR A GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THESE TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR TV."
R1Z4WF3QZ0PZIZ,3,"I bought these as a gift for my father for Christmas. He couldn't figure out how to work them. I wrote to Buy.com to get a return authorization at least 3 times and never heard back. Now I have the headphones in my possession and they don't seem to work correctly.  There is a lot of static and the on/off light never comes on. It is difficult to seat the phones in the cradle to get the charge light to come on, they have to be perfectly balanced.  Plus, these things are HUGE.  So, I can't speak for the sound quality or anything else because they are sitting in the box, but customer service from Buy.com is non-existent."
RQC3BY2RBT1RO,4,"I really wish I could give this set a 4 1/2 stars since they are awesome, but two tiny flaws keeps them from being perfect.    I want to say that first off, I am NOT an audiophile. With that out of the way, these things sound pretty darn good to my ears. They have been run through their paces with music ranging from thrash metal to opera, movie watching, and are used extensively for gaming. Everything sounds as I would expect except... and here is flaw number 1...    It's hard to explain, but having the base station in direct line with the phones creats a sort of whiney static every now and then. Turning my head left or right causes the sound to go away completely. Repeatedly shaking your head as if saying \\""no\\"" will make the sound come, go, come, go until you stop shaking your head. The sound doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough to be slightly annoying.    The other flaw that I found is the power saving mode. After so many minutes of no signal, the BASE STATION turns off! I don't really see the point in this as the base is plugged into the wall, not really needing to save power nearly as much as the phones would since they're on battery power. When the base turns off *useally when you least expect it to while working on the computer* you are greeted with a sudden jolt loud white noise static in your ears. The headphones themselves have no power saving feature for auto turn off to save the batteries, which just seems a little backwards to me.    But, with that said, battery life in these things has been a complete non-issue. I've had this kit for 10 months now and never had to replace the batteries. Using a pair of Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries, putting the headset on the base when finished with them recharges the batteries. Even then, I have litterally used these phones ALL DAY without recharging them and have never had the batteries die on me. Wether this is due to the quality of the batteries of the efficiency of the phones, I don't know, butI'm impressed either way.    And for being wireless, the range on these things is incredible. Living in a two story house with an addition on the far side, I was able to walk outside to my car or to the farthest side of the house without nary a change in audio quality. Occasionally there would be a hiss or a tiny bit of static if I got just one step too far out, but really the range is FAR longer than I ever anticipated. I had free roam of the house and part of the outdoors with these babies!    Overall they're a really awesome set of headphones for my uses. Good quality audio, NO WIRES to get pulled or tangled, and excellent battery life. Now if only they would add auto-off to the phones themselves, fix the weird straight angle whine, and add a microphone to the mix, they would be the perfect set!"
RTPPCRW6YW7MO,3,"I ordered these headphones even though I already owned a set of Unisar ones (which are far less expensive and work quite well). I bought the new ones for greater range. The range is very good, but the sound quality is horrible. There's a tuning dial on the headphones, and no matter how I have them set up, it sounds like there's a helicopter in my left ear. I can get it so that the helicopter sounds far away, but it's still there. That is annoying. As far as range goes, though...you can walk out of the room and into the basement and you can still listen. That will be nice when I want to listen to TV while washing dishes or doing other things. I just wish I could figure out what I'm doing  that is causing the helicopter sounds.    Oh, the headphones are really large (nearly too bulky) but quite comfortable. I likely look like an NFL football coach when wearing them.    Although the headphones were rather easy to set up if you knew what you were doing, the instructions are hugely lacking. They are in about eight languages, but there is nothing in-depth. I would have likes a troubleshooting section to help me with the helicopter noise in the left ear piece."
R2A5X8R0971VMM,4,"This is a very good sounding set of wireless headphones. They are a little too wide for my taste, and I occasinally have them slip around as I move my head. I also occasionally have to adjust the wireless connection and \\""re-tune\\"" the base and the headphones, but it's a minor annoyance. Again, I think the sound quality is very good, especially for wireless."
RVLHVBTT6PVJN,4,Worked out well. Used with graphic EQ to watch movies on TV.   Batteries last for tull evening viewing.  Wireless reception good.
R2T5WWULFI286W,5,Very pleased with these so far.  Purchased them as a gift for my dad who has trouble hearing dialoge when watching shows and movies.  Now he can hear what is being said without having to turn on captions! Set up was easy and he can quickly un plug and plug in to another tv in the house if he wants.  Great product!
R3FXPL2GA74WGC,5,I have been using wired head phones before and I find these much better.  The sound quality is great and I no longer have problems with getting the cord tangle in my swivel chair.  It was easy to set up and charge and allows me to walk around the house and still hear.  I have only used it on my computer but I think it will work for tv's also and that will allow me to get good reception in the kitchen when I want to watch tv.    I am very happy with the device so far.
RDD6KBQEE8TQI,4,"This is the third pair of wireless headsets I have owned.  I can't recall the brands of the previous two, but this unit is the best of the three, overall.  I don't put great demand of my headsets; I deal with hearing loss and use them to watch TV.  The sound quality is super and the volume available is outstanding.  Controls are easy to locate and use.  I haven't determined just  how far I can be from the transmitter, but I am able to stand at my BBQ and continue to monitor whatever athletic event I'm watching.  Because of the 'shape' of the headsets I have to wear them backwards, but that's OK.  Hook-up was simple enough with the transmitter hiding in my media cabinet.  Hang them on the transmitter/recharger in the evening and they're ready to go.  For the price these are a great solution for those who prefer not to 'blast' the TV to the neighborhood."
R2FCCKZS6XOGJZ,5,"We've had these for a couple of weeks hooked up to the TV in our family room, and they're perfect for this.  I have them plugged into the rca audio out on our Samsung lcd, so we can mute the tv sound and adjust the volume on the headphones.   No need to turn off the tv speakers or mess with any menu items.  I can watch tv after the kids are asleep, and the range has been really good for me. I can move into the kitchen or even down into the basement (still within 20 feet straight-line) of the transmitter and only get a little static.  Best of all, we have the base unit behind the wooden doors of the entertainment center, so it doesn't show at all but the connection is still good.   There's also much more harmony in the house when my daughter wants to watch the Wizards of Waverly Place marathon she dvr'd and the rest of us don't have to partake.   I wouldn't call these super high fidelity and wouldn't want to use them for music, but they're perfect for tv."
R36MKVN1VRFJOL,1,"Bought this because my wife is hearing impaired and cannot hear the TV.  Much to my astonishment we could get ZERO reception from ANY distance of our TV.  After reading the instructions I found a footnote that says electronics can cause interference, especially TVs and you should put the base unit as far from them as possible.    YES YOU READ CORRECTLY.  The manufacturer states that electronics (especially TV's) can be incompatible with these headphones.    Please note you have about 3 foot of cord to get the base unit away from electronics... this was not far enough to make any difference for us.  We will be testing this on other TV's but my advice is that you can't afford to take the risk that this won't work on your TV.  (Yes our TV headphone jack works on other headphones).    My advice is to keep looking."
R17AIRONTADRS1,1,"My wife bought these for my birthday and I was too lazy to try them as soon as I got them, I know my bad. But as soon as I opened the box I was disappointed. I mean those suckers cost more than $100.00 dollars with shipping!<br /><br />I was thinking I am getting great stuff, instead, I found pretty crappy packaged unit with VERY POOR manual and quality of the plastic is very low!<br /><br />When I connected them and tried them with my new SONY BRAVIA 1080 HD TV they worked with a lot of static in the background even at 3 ft away from the TV.<br /><br />First of all, you CANNOT put the sound on your TV all the way down (like I was thinking to do) because those headphones will not work at all. On my TV the min set on sound bar should be set to 6. I went over that thinking everything else will get better if I maybe charge the batteries it came with more over the night.<br /><br />The next night I put them on again and they again had static in the background. After 10 min or so the sound from TV abruptly went away and horrible static went in. Scared me to no end!<br /><br />I used them for three nights more for about 10 min every night and the horrid static comes in after about 10 min of use.<br />Please note that I am about 6 ft away from the transmitter. So, these headphones are JUNK!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY, THIS IS JUNK! I would give it zero stars if I could!<br /><br />STAY AWAY! 100% waste of your hard earned money!"
R16T827INS776I,2,"These are an excellent price, and the sound is \\""ok\\"", but there is a hissing sound in the background that is difficult to minimize (even changing channels, moving the base like it says)."
R1PTHE2HRYY374,4,"I bought these wireless headphones to replace an Acoustics Research set  that conked out.  These Sennheisers have good sound in all ranges,   easy recharging, and good TV compatibility for their moderate price.  The only thing that prevented me from rating these headphones 5-stars  is that the design and comfort leaves much to be desired.  I knew when  I purchased them that they were \\""on-the-ear\\"" type and that's not the  problem; the on-ear part is very comfortable and can even be replaced  if necessary for a small charge.  The annoying, uncomfortable part is  the headphone band that goes across the top of the head.  It does  have some foam/velour padding, but the way they're designed makes them  press on the top of the head regardless of how you adjust them.  After  an hour or so, I have to re-adjust them so my head doesn't hurt.  I can live with this, but the most infuriating thing is that when   moving around the house while wearing them, if you just bend forward  slightly they fall off and hit the floor regardless of how they are  on your head.  The only way I got around this was to position the  headband far back, behind the crown of my head.  This works if you only  bend forward slightly, but if you bend way down to pick something  up, they still fall off.  If you're standing on a hard floor, this  could cause them to break.  I wish the designers would test these  products on human beings with various head sizes and moving around  like you're supposed to be able to.  That's the idea of wireless  headphones, right?  I honestly think they tested these on a  honeydew melon.  Otherwise, for the price, I think these are a good  sounding, good range wireless set.  They just need a design upgrade  that's more comfortable and effective."
R3PI2WMUR34Y5W,5,"I purchased Sony's cordless headset locally without doing any research and I hated them so much I returned it immediately. They were simply awful. It was suggested to me to look on Amazon, which I did, and I found numerous positive reviews for the Sennheiser and numerous negative reviews for the Sony. I purchased the Sennheiser for about half the cost of the Sony and it is far superior in quality. The sound is most important and the Sennheiser delivers. I am so very glad I purchased my new headset from Amazon."
R2N7QNU33W4T4A,3,"No fault of the Sellers, but the item did not work (I personally believe this was the manufacturer's problem).  That being said, when it was time to return the item the Seller was right there.  They were friendly, understood the problem and refunded our purchase price in its entirety.  Obviously, this Seller has a wonderful reputation and knows how to deal with problems. I would readily purchase an item from them again.  Additonally, Amazon contacted the Seller immediately to resolve this issue.  Thanks to Ace Photo and Digital and Amazon were are satisfied."
R3IJRR7E9LSD8C,4,"Helpful hit:<br /><br />Turn off any other wireless devices in your house while useing the headphones.<br />I had my baby monitor on and I got scratchy reception.<br />However, when I turned it off, it was clear as a bell!!  :D<br /><br />The product has 'some' bass, but I usually listen to ambient - house music, and the headphones aren't cut out for it.<br /><br />Classical, country, rock, and TV would be great for these headphones.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great product!"
RU9HH0AO93OQ9,2,I have not been able to find a way to eliminate an annoying interference for the headphones (I have two)  The transmitter is plugged into the headphone outlet of an Onkyo receiver.  When playing radio or cds -no problem.  When viewing dvds or watching tv it is really a pain.
R20XXRNZI0AHLD,4,"I WEAR THEM AS I WORK. THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS, I ALWAYS HAVE TO AJUST THEM WHEN I BEND OVER. OTHER WISE THEY ARE GREAT."
R2MXCNCB847B41,5,"I've had Sennheiser cordless headphones for years and use them virtually every day.  My older pair gave me great sound with limited range.  These give me superior sound with excellent range.  The 'fit' is easily adjusted and I can wear them for hours with no noticeable fatigue.  The charging 'cradle' is a big improvement over my old pair; those required me to remember to turn the headphones around before placing them in the cradle, being careful to position the charging points so there was solid contact.  The new pair simply requires you to place the headphones 'on' the cradle; charging contact is made automatically.      My ONLY complaint with this unit has been mentioned by other reviewers; I have accidentally adjusted the 'tuning' on the right earphone when I was trying to adjust volume, but I've learned not to do that and now it's not a problem.  Speaking of tuning, for those reviewers having problems with signal sound quality, I must presume not everyone has taken the time to 'tune' their headset to the 'receiving' channel (there are three separate channels that are selected on the bottom front of the base).  Without proper 'tuning' there is indeed quite a racket through the earpieces but tuned properly, the signal is clear as a bell and of extremely high quality.  When listening throughout the house it is true that increasing the range from the base will increase noise from atmospheric interference but even at it's worst, these headphones give excellent fidelity from many different listening locations.  I recommend them without qualification."
RSKSQU4YOZIMS,4,"When they expired, I bought a new set from Amazon. Unlike other reviewers on Amazon, I am not going to talk about my shipping experience, which was great. Nor I will go into intro great detail from people who are obviously engineers and are obsessed with how they should have been designed. Get back to the lab, fellas, break is over.    My review is: They worked great and broke. I'm getting another pair. If this pair breaks, I'm not getting another pair of HS-120's.     I will put my change in my change jar and buy a pair of RS-130's when I get enough. If these break after a short period of use, that mean the factory in China has a problem and I don't want to be a guinea pig for them.    I'll get another brand other than Sennhauser. End of review.     Whoops, this was more than a review wasn't it? This monologue shows some of the characters we bipolars have. We talk to long, to loud, and to much. And we digress. Kinda like engineers."
RUTSYPLWLILMW,1,"This is the third time I have ordered from Amazon and the third time I received inferior merchandise.  My cousin ordered a coffee pot, many yrs ago and it has the same defect that mine has.  I asked her where she bought it and ... yep ... it came from Amazon.com   Three times and you're out. Goodbye!"
R22TS5VET7KRMV,1,the sound breaks up. there are moments of silence that are very irritating. bad buy. would not do it again.
RMW6BVOPKRW6R,5,We bought these for my dad. He is blind and somewhat hard of hearing. Now he can listen to the programs he enjoys at the level he needs without disturbing anyone. He loves them.
RYL99V61D89HQ,3,Could have been cheaper. Not very comfortable on the ears as it does not surround the ears but sits on it. Painful by the end of the football game. Hissing sound and clicks very loud at times. Not a huge improvement over the cheaper one I bought at circuit-city few years ago.
R3JSR1ZI75QSLW,1,Terrible sound quality! Bad clipping. Will not tune properly on any preselect channel.  Insufficient volume. If you have three discreet channels on the transmitter why would you put a really touchy analog tuner on the headset right next to the volume control???   I tried all three channels and had the same result.  Really disappointed in these.  Based on the previous reviews it appears that they either work or they don't....
R29Q4H8AGV3ID9,4,"The earphones are excellent in all qualities except that the controls tend to be a bit hard to access on the earphones and are not smooth - particularly volume and tuning.  The biggest problem is that they are open phones and I wear them in bed at night.  I did not realize how much sound escapes to disturb my wife who is sleeping by my side.  These are not earphones to get if you wish to preserve quiet around you.  Get closed phones.  Otherwise, excellent"
R3N4Q8LSMHORTS,5,"I'm hard of hearing and had a problem understanding words on the TV. Before I got these headphones, I had to sit in a chair next to the television, and still missed a lot, even with the TV on the highest volume. My audiologist recommended RF headphones, so I got this one. With these headphones, I hear perfectly, don't miss anything, and they are very comfortable. I love them and so do my neighbors who don't have to hear my blaring TV any more! I feel as though they have actually improved the quality of my life and would recommend them to anyone."
RI1OOS2UFIBD9,5,"Ok I fugured out the set up , if you plug in the single prong into your tv,dvd player,blue ray , single prong headset female recepticle , turn the volumn on your tv,blue ray , dvd player all the way up \\""max\\"" (after you plug in the head set ofcourse)..doing this increases the signal , I TRIED THIS AND ABSOLUTLY NO STATIC !!!!!!!!!! This is only my 3rd day with them and now that i figured how to get rid of the static it is a great bargain , these are easily 150$ headset . quality is fantastic , when playing ps3 , the missles go from one side left  \\""through your head lol \\"" to the other side right ! awsome . best of all no static ! no hsssssssssssssss ! and reading the other reviews im expecting to them to get even better ,,,,supposedly the speakers need time to be broken in , so it is supposed to get even better ,,,,,improving on the sound I already think is great !      I dont know much about headphones , my first pair . they fit great , very soft on the ears and head . they look kewl ,it gets 5 stars ...except the HSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS(static) IN THE BACKGROUND . that is kinda the purpose isnt it to hear fantasic sound quality . when its turned up and u can drown out the hiss it is surpberb . I bought this for my ps3 and watching blue ray's late at night . So during movies and games where there is dialoug or brief quietness , the HSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS becomes annoying . I have read other reviews and advice about controling the HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS by the way you set it up , sorry but they are wrong , TOO USE THE 2 PRONG AUDIO OUT ON ANY TV OR RECIEVER IS USED FOR OTHER \\""COMPLETE\\"" COMPONANTS , NOT HEAD PHONES , SO THAT SET UP DOES NOT WORK , THE ONLY WAY IS THE HEAD PHONE SINGLE PRONG INSERT. ( SO THEREFORE SLIGHTY WEEKER SIGNAL MEANING STATIC OR HSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.) NOW IF THE HAD A DIGITAL OPITCAL OUT HOOK UP ,THAT WOULD WORK CAUSE YOU COULD USE THE HDML for  DISPLAY (VIDEO) only AND SWITCH THE AUDIO TO OPITCAL OUT . MEANING YOU DONT NEED A COMPLETE COMPONANT FOR A TWO PRONG AUDIO OUT (WHICH DOES NOT WORK )    Any way if you dont mind static these are 5 stars .    If anyone reads this and can recommend to me a set of head phones that does not have static . please let me know !!!!!!!!!!"
R2AZ891435KCNV,4,"An exceptional product for the price paid. Good sound quality and coverage, hooked to TV, works anywhere in my 2 storey house."
R1UC07NEFONWF9,5,"Very satisfied with headphones.  Reception is clear, and can walk around the house and yard while listening to the TV.  Seems to work well up to 150 - 200' away, through walls and out into the street."
R2FYLMJXBZVNZ5,1,"Reception was always poor no matter how one tinkers with the configuration. Put them away, then decided to dig them out again recently. The left channel no longer works, a wiring issue no doubt. I would definitely NOT recommend these headphones."
RE7DQP2M3Y6PQ,4,"I bought these headphones two years ago for use at work.  Most of my day is spent tied to the keyboard, and I was tired of having to move the headphone wires around the keyboard / mouse, or worst of all, forgetting I had them plugged in when standing up - yank!    I will give these headphones excellent marks overall, with only one real criticism.  I should note that I have not tried any other brands, so I have no comparison except to rather poor quality corded phones.    Sound quality is amazing, range is far longer than I need (do I really need to wear them to get copies, coffee, or go to the bathroom - no, but I can, so good enough), and the battery life is longer than most workdays.  The charging system is inspired - effective, easy, and almost fashionable.  The headphones are much more comfortable than my previous walkman style mini's, though their size is considerable - I feel like the guy in Empire Strikes Back - discrete they are not.    As other reviewers have noted, the system works best when you have your computer/player volume cranked, and use the on-headphone volume adjustment.  Working this way, I rarely have any hiss or static.  This does expose the one weakness of the system - the frequency tuner and the volume control are close to each other and use the same size and texture of adjusting wheel.  If one wishes to adjust the volume while still wearing the headphones (which one most certainly will), it is all too easy to inadvertently hit the tuner instead - insert loud squeal of static, then two minutes of having to find the right channel again...  It would have been a simple matter to make one of the wheels differently textured, or sized, or something.  But no.    But, I would buy them again, especially now that they are cheaper."
RHP60JX538Q4C,4,I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 for my father who just moved into a retirement community where TV's and music cannot be played after 10:00 PM.  My father is very happy not only with the performance but the freedom the unit provides to him.
RGROPEO1LS4A8,5,"I bought this for listening to the TV while walking on my treadmill.  I was blowing my neighbors out trying to hear the TV over the sound of the treadmill.  It works perfect, I love it.  I have a fairly small apartment (700 sq ft) so I can be anywhere in my whole apartment and still hear everything perfectly clear.  It was easy to hook-up and use.  I haven't used it long enough to wear the battery down so I can't help you on that one."
R1V3J43CV2WIZ3,1,"I bought these about 1-1/2 years ago and they have stopped working.  I can receive music (coming from who-knows-where) and radio signals loud and clear but I'm trying to receive my TV stations and suddenly I can't.  They are also very loose and will fall off my head if I lean forward at all.  I was willing to put up with the looseness but now they cannot be used at all.<br /><br />later: they started working again and I'm pleased with the sound but they are still very loose.  Don't know what to do about that.<br /><br />It's now 2013 and I'm still using these so I guess I did get my money's worth BUT there seems to be a short in them.  They are either on (very loud) or off, nothing in between.  I'm not looking to upgrade and confused about what to buy."
R1IUSVP43FCOZL,5,"I would highly suggest these if you or your spouse likes to watch tv while the other one is trying to go to sleep.  I am very impressed with the quality, sound, and price and would buy these again!  My husband loves them too and now we both go to sleep happy"
RVKUG25FOOWYI,5,These have been great for enjoying TV without disturbing anyone else - or when the kids are in earshot and language may not be appropriate. I got 3 of these 2 years ago for Christmas and have a set in 3 rooms with TV's and love them. Sometimes I even wear them when there is no reason just because the sound is better than the TV sound.  They are the best thing ever for being able to enjoy the TV in bed while spouse is sleeping or watching the big screen in the family room from the kitchen while doing dishes once the kids are in bed.
R2GTU1T19IPH31,3,"If you want to sit back and relax while listening to music or watching TV, these are great headphones.  They even work OK for moderate activity as long as you don't lean forward or bend over.  A simple strap around the back would have solved the problem.  I think the sound and range is excellent considering the fact that they are wireless, and the price point.  For a few hundred dollars more, Bose probably makes something better.  The loose fit actually adds to the comfort but don't lean over the pool or the toilet."
R3OVFCFRIAYDNQ,5,"I bought these after reading several reviews and I am so glad I did! My boyfriend works nights and the bedroom is right above the living room. I couldn't watch TV at a volume that I could hear it that he couldn't. These have saved me- My couch is only about 10 feet from the TV so it works great, small amount of interference if you walk into another room but for my needs- 5 stars!"
R9G1D4Q927SM2,5,"What a joy not to be tethered to my computer any longer. I listen to a lot of music, watch tons of movies, and these headphones reproduce the sound wonderfully. They're also quite comfortable and they have great range. I can wander all over the house, even out to get the mail, and the reception is still strong. The battery life is great, too. The controls could be a little easier to use, but once you set the volume where you want it, you'll only use the on/off switch after that, anyway, so it's not a big deal. I'd recommend these headphones in a heartbeat."
R2FOTNK3I398G9,1,"Seems like the reviews on Amazon for this product fall in two categories - 5 star love-fests and 1-star complaints of reception.  I'm afraid this review falls into the latter category.  I'm using these headphones literally 8 feet from the receiver, and I hear distortion when I turn my head or just when something in the universe shifts and causes these headphones to make a high pitched noise.  Also, you have to get them balanced PERFECTLY on the cradle to charge - otherwise the little charging light goes out.<br /><br />The name implies German quality, but these are Made in China, and seem very cheap and poorly engineered.  Back to Amazon they go..."
RIQ8HELGE5NTK,5,"I returned to college two years ago and I had tons of project due every week, plus I worked.  Our house is small and you can hear the TV in our computer room so my husband and I were always having battles over volume control.  My grandmother recommended this amazing headset.  I purchased one and it saved my marriage and helped my get a 3.9 GPA.  The clarity of this headset is amazing.  They make you feel like you are in a theater.  We loved this product so much I have purchase a set for my father and father-in-law.  I most have if you have small children also."
R13BGO4L8AREIM,1,"I don't understand the high ratings for this product.  I have these headphones, and I have a Rocketfish set.  The Rocketfish set looks terrible; I thought these would look less conspicuous, and they do, but the sound quality--the only thing that really matters in the end--is terrible.  That is to say, the sound quality is great--what you can hear of it beyond the steady background distortion which goes away only for seconds at a time but is otherwise always there.  I can use these to listen to the TV when I don't really care about the experience of listening--I just want to hear what people are saying.  But I cannot use these headphones for watching movies when I want to hear all the nuances and all the background sounds, like a surround sound.  I think one star is too high for what I purchased these for.  Take my advice, go with Rocketfish!"
RTVSLP1OOHEDR,1,I bought these based on the good reviews I'd read but once I got them I was extremely disappointed in them.  Maybe I'm just used to better quality than some of the other reviewers but in my opinion the sound quality of these headphones is terrible.  You get almost no bass response at all. There is a very noticeable hiss at all volumes and the volume will only go to a certain level no matter what the source volume is set at.  The earphones are comfortable but do make your ears hot.  They are like wearing earmuffs.  The seller I bought them from wouldn't allow returns of earphones so I ended up giving them to my teenage son.  $65 wasted.
R246VJO9Y5LWZH,5,"I just love these headphones - My Wife just loves that I have them - she feels like it was an early Christmas gift for her.<br />I am using these for my television - she was so tierd of my having the \\""noise\\"" going all of the time.  This has been a great relief for us both.  Ease of use is great - controls right on the phones and the recharge is so simple just rest them in the stand - no plug to worry with - great battery life - good range around the house or out to the car or deck. They are not uncomfortable to wear and you can still hear instructions from the wife or the phone or door bell.<br />I have not yet used them for music - they seem to be of a high quality sound technology so I am expecting that I will be just as impressed with the music capability as well.  I am thinking about getting a splitter switch to connect my receiver as well."
RN3H2GUVKB7GJ,4,"The reception of these headphones are fantastic, however the sound quality was a little disappointing. These will work great for watching Tv late at night but will not satisfy for high fidelity listening."
R2R43VCF3KPBAX,5,"Pro:  We have tried two other wireless remotes and neither was satisfactory. We ordered the Sennheiser 120 for my use in the bedroom. I love it. The sound quality is remarkable, I particularly like the stereo effects with the left-right separation. I've use it for hours at a time and never had to put it on the charger until I had finished for the day. My wife tried it out, and wanted one for her use in the living room. I had a little problem setting up the two until I discovered the \\""channel\\"" switch on the base unit,The two units work great now without interfering with each other.    Con:  The instructions are very poorly done, and not very complete."
R2P11M1QW0XSSJ,4,"Exceptional clarity.  Much better than TV Ears.  Great reception and do not have to be in direct line with the receiver.  Can get reception all over the house.  A little bit heavy and a little too tight, but these are manageable criticisms.  All-in-all, a great product and very reasonable price."
R2UCH8S4528NZY,5,These Sennheiser TV wireless earphones and transmitter work great.  The headphones are lighter and more comfortable to wear than the old Radioshak set we bought some years ago.  The tuning feature is useful when older model cordless telephones are about.
R5THP676O0HXX,5,this is the first wireless headphone i even had.  it works great and the sound quality is good.  the price is reasonable too.  recommend this wireless headphone for anyone who is looking for budget wireless with good quality.
R3I43FDAQKGXVX,4,I'm pleased with the headphones they came with every thing it said (including the 1/4 & 1/8 adapters) works well. I live in an apartment and watch movies late when i get off work these headphones work great. No complaints for the price great sound & and looks good (they match my TV and stand) no cut offs when I go to the frig to get another beverage ;-) .
RJ047WVD27WL6,5,"for many years I used a small set of headphones attached to a long extension wire  (approx. 12 ft) connected to the headphone jack in front of my TV. After time the TV headphone jack started giving me problems and I had to wiggle the wire to make a connection, this process did not last long before I had to have a costly repair done. After a few more years the same thing started again. So I recently purchased a new TV, because I couldn't get sound out of the old one, and decided to purchase Sennheiser rs120 wireless headphones. What a pleasure! Why did I wait so long?"
R3DYUC9B2BVFRX,4,"I purchased these so that I could listen to various sources (FM Radio, MP3's, Internet broadcasts) while doing woodworking in my garage.  They were to replace a set of Jensen wireless headphones whose earcups were falling apart.  I have the transmitter in an upstairs office so that it can be hooked to my portable stereo that is also connected to my computer's sound card.    First of all, the range (distance from signal source) on these headphones is fantastic.  I get good reception in my garage, and I have even used them when mowing the yard so that I can listen to a football broadcast on the internet.    The only down side is that they are NOT a sound isolating style of headphone.  In other words, you have to turn up the volume fairly significantly to overcome ambient noise (lawnmower, tablesaw, etc).  I agree with other reviewers that the fit isn't the best...they can slip off your head if you bend down quickly to pick something up.    Overall, I am pleased with this item."
RCMEWHYNLG2O6,4,"I am pleased with my Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle.  Once tuned properly, the sound is very good with little or no background noise.  I also appreciate the AAA rechargeable batteries over the old proprietary battery used on earlier models.  It also has a greater wireless range than my older Sennheiser."
R1SMNLNWT6QI7Q,4,"I love wireless headphones. I first owned a set of inexpensive Acoustic Research radio-frequency earphones which lasted fine for about 5 years when (at long last) the input plug died. I tried having it fixed but it broke again, so I bought a set of Sony infra-red 'phones and didn't like them. IR phones are line-of-sight and I didn't like losing the TV dialog when I went to the, um, men's room.<br /><br />Then I bought these. They've got very good range, work extremely well for listening to TV late at night without waking up my early-rising spouse (our bed's headboard is on the other side of the wall from the speakers on our big-screen LCD TV). Since I'm hard of hearing, the volume has to be up for me to understand the dialog over the average movie's eternal, irritating mood music.<br /><br />There's only a few things I would change about this set of 'phones:<br />1.) They would benefit from having an indicator LED to show when the power to them is on. No 'biggie' but an irritant,<br />2.) The tuning control is far too close to the volume control. I've moved the tuner sometimes when trying to adjust the volume and I have sometimes lost a bit of dialog. My AR 'phones had the tuning wheel on the opposite earphone from the volume control, and<br />3.) The units are a bit heavy. I often have to remove them to rest my head (and ears ... the tension on the headband is a bit strong).<br /><br />Other than those items I'd recommend them to anyone who wants a good, solid pair of 'phones at a reasonable price. I don't think they're audiophile quality, but they're good enough for all types of TV watching. The batteries last a long, long time, recharging is via two contacts on the headband and is easy to make connection with the charger, and volume and sound clarity are good; not great but good enough."
R1APNFYKDTXPHQ,4,"These headphone are technically great, the sound is very good, they are very easy to control and adjust. I am able to enjoy TV without struggling to hear all the sound while keeping the TV volume much lower. These headphones are a must for anyone with experiencing some hearing loss that usually comes with too many birthdays. My only problem is that they do not stay on my head very well when I get up and move around."
R1QVKKHFNKYKXQ,5,I am becoming hard of hearing and this headset is a great alternative to turning up the volume. I am running a new Panasonic plasma and the sound is great through these headphones.  Not sure about battery life as I haven't had them long enough but the charging stand works fine.
R2XLDN2SIE10E3,5,"Bad these for 8 years now and have only great things to say about these headphones.  They still sound great and they only issue I have had was that a plastic tab that holds the ear pad onto the headphones  broke off (probably my fault). Got a replacement in a couple days  Audio performance, comfort and overall product quality is great.  When the time comes to replace these, I know that I will be ordering another pair."
RSBSD9D27OC4Y,5,My highest recommendations ... these give amazing theater like sound ... can use with TV or just connect Iphone/Ipod and listen in perfect clarity all over house. Have ordered a second set for a friend. Can watch a game on tv and wander off and do stuff and still know if you need to get back and watch .. get stuff done and never miss important play. Endless uses and worth every every cent. I like these better than that other big name brand as these charge themselves ..  with other brand easy to leave on and battery will be no good. You cannot go wrong with these.
R2CKFJSPXKTSO1,4,"Pros - Light weight, Good Sound,battery life and reception<br />cons - yet to find one. Could have had a compact design though."
RQ3NSM6CRFAKR,5,"This is the first set of these I have ever owned, but I don't know how they could be better. They are very comfortable, the sound is great and the reseption is great.  I am not a sound guru but they fill the bill for me."
R24LUTFXB54AUM,5,"Okay, I always research and read as many reviews as possible.  WE LOVE THIS HEADSET (my wife and I). The purpose of gettnig one was soley forthe use on our TV in our master bedroom. My equipment data: ATT Uverse, 52\\"" Samsung LCD.  Works perfectly.  I do NOT hear any hissing noise when I use it. My wife is very critical of every \\""new\\"" gadget I buy.  She loves this headset.  No complaints.  We use it when the other goes to sleep first.  So, granted we don't crank it up.  There is no need too. If you're having second doubts based on the bad reviews, don't! As long as you use this tiem for what it is intended on. Watching TV while you're significant other is slumbering away :>"
R1L8DLB37F8JDI,5,"These are well worth your money. The AA rechargeable batteries that  you install (they provide them) are lasting, and so far in about four months I have not had an inkling of trouble with them.  The clarity of these headphones is wonderful (you may get a faint hiss if you don't tune them in properly), and you can walk all over your house with them on and maintain your nearly perfect reception.  The three controls are quite simple to use (on/off on the left ear, then volume and tuning on the right), and they, finally, are very comfortable to wear.....most times I forget I am even wearing them."
R1EEX8B4XXNIH5,4,Sound quality is great. This is my 3rd pair of wireless headphones and they have the best sound quality of the bunch. They have great battery life so far. the charging stand is easiest I have ever seen.The only complaint is they dont have the best fit.
R3PMCS95DX0FL7,4,"If the volume on the headphones is up and the signal volume down, I get interference.  I use these at my desk because the wires of my old ones kept getting tangled, in that regard they are great.  The sound is audible in the room though if I have them up to a decently loud volume.  I have found I can walk a good 30' away, with 2 doors in between and still get good reception."
RY1MQ44UECYTX,5,"What do people want for $64.00????  These wire-less headphones are the best thing since electricity was invented!!!!  The recharger is the easiest thing to use in the world!  Anyone who has any trouble whatsoever with the charging station has severe \\""personal issues\\""!  I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!!!!!  They are so very comfortable that I wear them for hours!!!  They hold on to your head so lightly that one must not bend over or they will slide off.  They have some weight to them so they will \\""move\\"" if you thrash around alot.<br /><br />This other \\""percieved problem\\"" with the automatic shut-off or pause of sound that happens occasionally.  I understand that this is due to poor signal.  This does happen sometimes, breifly, to me when I am listening to the internet radio. It is only a vey brief \\""dead spot\\"" then the sound comes back ASAP with no problems.  To me this is not the head-set's fault... it is the radio transmittion/signal problems from the source.<br /><br />AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED....THESE HEADPHONES ARE THE BEST $64.00 CAN POSSIBLY BUY!"
R2LG3BGLJWKG72,5,"I bought this to save my marriage, lol. My husband couldn't hear the TV with our rambunctious 2-year old around without cranking up the volume to headache-level and constant rewinding. I got him these wireless headphones for watching TV and they have been great for us. There is no hiss or interference, and the sound is really good. He can set his volume on the headphones and I can have my own volume on the TV (or I can mute it). They are easy to recharge (just throw them on the hanger). I do have to look before I adjust the volume since the control is located on the ear, but it's no big deal -- I mean, where else could you put the control on a wireless headset? The controls are very easy to use. The only drawback is that lying on your side (vegging on the couch a la \\""jabba the hut\\"") can be uncomfortable if you rest your head on a pillow or couch arm because of the size (but I knew that when I bought them- it's not like they're earbuds). It took my husband about five minutes to hook this up. So now my husband can watch all the sci-fi he wants and he's free to help me run after the little guy (hooray for wireless!). And I don't get headaches. These things are great for our purposes!! We have no complaints."
RF5Y5U1TIJDFK,3,"These headphones work great with great range.  No interference and the tuning controls makes it easy to tune when you walk farther from the control unit.  I guess the only drawback is that the bass is too low.  What I mean is that if there is a low bass part in a song the bass gets muted like the speaker int he headphone cant handle it. It really on on the really low bass.  I listed to rock and alternative, so the low bass only comes once in a while, but when it happens it seems likes its missing a bass kick.  I would go to a store, find out the best headphone and come back and buy it here."
R1M9C9HNH7TIKS,1,"I read a number of reviews of this product but missed this key problem, the transmitter for the unit turns itself off after five minutes of no sound.  This means that if you fall asleep watching a movie, five minutes after it ends you will be blasted in the ear holes with full volume static.  There's no reason for this 'feature' and it is a complete deal breaker.      Otherwise, the headphones work well.  The sound quality and reception are better than I expected.  The fit is a little floppy for my head size but not so much that it drives me wild.  Certainly nothing in comparison to the blasting static in my head any time I pause or end the sound for five minutes.    DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES."
R3CS00PQW0101D,4,"this is a \\""god send\\"" for me.  the speakers for my tv are in the back.  I had to keep the volumn so low as to not disturb the family, that I had a hard time hearing shows at night.  now I just put my headphones on and I don't bother anyone.  I never realized the amount to background sounds until I started using using the headphones.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has hearing problems. you can also still hear someone talking to you, even with them on."
RHDX6Z4NZOBH5,5,"I have about stopped watching TV because even with my hearing aids, and the TV volume up high, I couldn't hear the soft spoken words and \\""missed\\"" half of the movie.  Now, with the headphones, I hear every word clearly and don't disturb my wife because I can turn the volume all the way down.  I can wonder all over the house and still hear everything.  I highly recommend this item.  Only complaint, as many have made, they fit loose on my head, but I can certainly live with that."
ROJGLXHFM23JU,1,"I had high hopes for this product as I really wanted to be able to watch tv without outside noise interfering. Regrettably, it was not to be. I tried the headphones on three different tv sets. I got nothing but static on any of them. At least their customer service is good and they took the headphones back without argument."
RT11GP62ZGL7W,5,"I just recommended these headphones to a family member because I love the set I purchased from Amazon almost two years ago. They work so beautifully; the sound is excellent and much better than what I can hear from the TV. All the subtle musical enhancements that are often lost through the speakers may be heard clearly, and for me one of the greatest benefits is how I can walk about the house doing things and never miss what's going on during a game or a show. The headset is a little on the large side but very comfortable. I'd like to purchase one of the small Sennheiser wireless TV headsets but they cost twice the money, so I'll likely purchase a second pair of RS120's with cradle. They are a good buy and well worth the money. I really enjoy this product!"
RV66OAUMEK0H3,4,"I got these for the office.  I wanted wireless ones as chords and armchairs are a dangerous mix.  I like them, but I still wish I went for the 130 or 140's, as they seem to have more sound isolation.<br /><br />Pros:<br />They are very comfortable, easy to use, low maintenance.  Sound decent, clear.<br /><br />Cons:<br />They bleed a lot of sound (poor sound isolation), so if you work in a quiet office, everyone will be listening with you.  Not a lot of bass, especially for large headphones.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Absolutely worth the $60 I paid for them.  Not ideal for quiet places or audiophiles.  Spend the extra money."
R2F1RKH0PQ5JOW,5,"I RECEIVED AN RS110 SEVERAL YEARS AGO.  THIS THING SAVED MY MARRIAGE.  MY HUSBAND IS HARD OF HEARING AND THE FACT THAT HE CAN TURN TV VOLUME ALL THE WAY DOWN AND I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE PROGRAMS HE LIKES, IS WONDERFUL.  I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED 2 RS120.  ONE FOR MYSELF IN THE BEDROOM AND ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE SAID IF IT EVER BROKE DOWN SHE WOULD BE ON THE PHONE THAT DAY TO GET ANOTHER ONE.  SHE THEN LOANED IT TO HER NEIGHBOR TO TRY.  THAT LADY CALLED ME AND GOT THE INFORMATION TO ORDER HER ONE.  SHE IS SO HAPPY WITH HERS, SHE THEN ORDERED ONE FOR A RELATIVE AND ONE FOR A FRIEND.  THEN MY HUSBANDS  FISHING FRIEND WAS OVER THE OTHER DAY AND TRIED IT.  HE DIDN'T EVEN WAIT TO GO HOME, BUT ORDERED ONE ON MY COMPUTER.  SO DON'T HESITATE, WELL WORTH THE MONEY.."
R187H5JFVZS49U,5,"Sound quality and range great.  I have had trouble with other headphones range or wifi interference causing static or sound drop off after moving a few feet away from the transmitter.  This product sounds great is comfortable, and works everywhere I have tried it.    You wont be disappointed."
R233T2TYK6TWOY,5,"I purchased the product to allow late night TV viewing in bed without disturbing anyone.  The headphones have worked flawlessly providing clear sound while being comfortable to wear.  The battery life has been very good and just dropping the headset on the cradle to recharge is simple.  I haven't tried these in other situations or with other sources, but I expect them to perform just as well there."
R3CZ7N4AMA6OFJ,5,love it not just limited to close but can go outside and still loud and clear
RYRLG3A4JL7OY,1,"I have had good experience with Sennheiser and several other brands' earphones/headphones for my various electronic devices.  But the RS120 is a major disappointment.  As others have reported, the flat foam earpieces allow the headphones to slip off with the slightest motion of your head.  Worse, the wireless reception is poor, requiring very specific positioning & tuning to avoid buzzing/hissing noise.  The noise returns with any change of head position.  I have returned the product as \\""unsatisfactory\\"".  I should have given more consideration to previous reviewers' comments on these same issues.[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]"
RB3935GGSMC6U,4,"I use this to listen to music at my desk while my wife watches TV in the open-plan living room nearby.  I'll also use it for TV viewing when the kids are sleeping.    I had some trouble with line interference (high-pitched buzzes) when I started using these, but figured out it was another component I'm using.  When I plug it in directly to my PC headphone jack, the sound is excellent.  The range seems fine within at least 70-80 feet; I haven't tested the actual range limit.    Sound is *very* good.  Be careful to listen to a good quality source.  I played a couple of poor-quality MP3s through it and was doubtful until I realised it was just reproducing the poor input.  With high quality input it's fine.    PROS:  + Excellent sound reproduction - great range, pleasing balance   + minimal (i.e. practically none) noise if you tune it in correctly (very slight hiss in almost silent music passages)  + decent volume  + battery life (rechargeables come with it) is fine  + recharging stand is easy to use (no hunting for contacts, etc)  + no noticeable interference from wifi, cellphone signals, etc.  + excellent feeling that you don't have to worry about cords when you stand up  + 'open' headphone cup style allows you to hear attackers creeping up on you from behind.    CONS:  - susceptible to line noise if any of your sound components are unshielded (you must either remove the component or shield it to get rid of the hisses and hums)  - looks really dumb when you stand up (but who cares really?!)  - 'open' headphone style forces you to hear wife watching Grey's anatomy if TV's in the same room. (Maybe a second set for her?? Aha!)  - there is a slight tendency to distort loud sounds; try turning down the input volume and turning up the headphones volume.  There may be an upper limit to the input volume it can handle.  It's plenty loud though."
RGDZRFWILHA3Z,3,I like the instrument but it is difficult to keep on my head. If I look down the headphones fall off. I am used to headphone cups that surround the ear and aid the stability of the headphones
R1OHGUVMTSGX8O,4,"I bought these primarily for use with my T.V., however I've branched out to using them with my stereo as well. First off people these are wireless so if you have ANY other thing working at the same frequency---expect problems, there is just so much air space out there to handle all the wireless signals out there. I myself have nothing using this frequency(926 Mhz) so my review might not be helpful to you.     The range is fine, I have used these head phones all over my yard(150 ft from the base. With no problems.    Volume control and signal selector---Other reviewers complain about their proximity, i have small hands(8.25\\"" from thumb to pinkie...stretched out, & a fore finger that's .5\\"" across) and have no problem.    Sound quality---I have a corded set of sennheisers the sound is comparable    Charging base----No problems here, just put them on and they charge(caveat----make sure the charging light is lit before you walk away.)    If you don't expect audiophile sound you should be really pleased with these.    Mine were refurbished and I only paid $34+shipping here at amazon."
R3KR4VMKYK82NH,4,"I have been using the cordless headphones for shortwave radio listening . Specificalyy, the Ham radio bands .  It is very convenient not to have wires . I leave the radio room and go to the kitchen, make coffee, etc. and still stay in touch with the radio . Occasional hissing occurs but only for a second. Definitly adds a nice level of fun to the hobby."
R28XG54KX43Y2G,5,"I very happy with these headphones; very good audio quality, very good range, and most of all how easy they are to recharge (no need to plug them in)."
RHGJMH9PS6ICK,4,"I struggled with which headphones to buy to watch TV at night so my spouse can sleep. Every time I read reviews I got overwhelmed and gave up. I'm happy that I finally settled on these Sennheisers, because they do just what I needed them to do at reasonable price.I'm very satisfied with these headphones.    They fit okay. Although they are not what I'd classify as \\""comfortable\\"", I don't wear them for more than a couple of hours a night, so they are acceptable. They do get hot on my ears when it's warm in the room. I tried a pair of TV Ears before and they are painful to wear, so these are MUCH more wearable than those were. I wish these had cup design so that they wouldn't slip around so much on my head when I move, the smooth ear covers can slip and slide.     These headphones are extremely easy to put on the charging stand.     The only time I hear hissing or static is when I first put them on and I haven't started the TV yet. If the TV is on pause when I first put the headphones on, there is static. After I start watching TV, I can pause without any noise. If there is static once I start to watch, all I need to do is turn the lower dial and tune in the headphones and no more problem.     I have a little trouble with the way the dials are set up, because it's easy to turn the wrong one. When I want volume, I might accidentally tune the headphones in the wrong direction and lose my clear sound. Easy to fix, but I'd rather not have to think about it. I also would like an easy on off switch. This one is tiny and a little hard to move.     I completely recommend these headphones to people who want to watch TV without disturbing others. I can hear most other sounds in the room even with the headphones in use. There is some sound leakage but it doesn't bother my spouse at all. (I use these with a 52\\"" Sony Bravia LCD TV. I turn off the separate sound system to use the headphones.)"
R28WZ6NKSSRBOT,2,"When I ordered Sennheiser RS 120 headphones I didn't expect very much and I wasn't disappointed.  This company has a great reputation for sound quality but the low price caused me to have doubts.    The sound quality would be acceptable if the \\""hiss\\"" from the transmitted sound were not so pronounced.  The tuning adjustment is of some help but to tune all of the \\""hiss\\"" out so degrades the audio quality that the device is unusable.    It appears that if the audio input levels are even slightly low the \\""hiss\\"" is very loud and annoying.  Turning the input level up does help but that defeats the purpose of the earphones (having a silent TV).  Using the audio out of a receiver with a standardized-fixed level is inadequate to control the RF \\""hiss\\"".    The fit and comfort of the headset is acceptable but don't expect to wear the headphones for an extended period.     Overall the RS 120 would be a good buy but the annoying hiss detracts to the extent that I would not recommend this unit until the manufacturer addresses the noise level at low signal inputs.    It will pay you, I think, to look to a different manufacturer or spent a little more to purchase a better quality product from Sennheiser."
RC9ULQCPOXALU,4,Basically I love it! good reception and I can watch tv late at night when I get home without disturbing anyone. The one issue I have is that the controls sometimes get knocked out of kilter by the pillow. So if you are sitting up its great but if you are lying down like sick in bed you may move and then have to readjust the settings.
R3RAZNCCPWSU8,5,"The second set I have purchased for myself.  The first set lasted about for many years, so when they failed, I ordered another set.  Reception and sound quality are very good.  Televisions with optical cable outlets require an inexpensive analog convertor."
R5X2Z7S0NTEXA,5,"I purchase these headphones for my Dad who is very hard of hearing, He and my mother love them, He can watch TV with the mute on and still hear great through the headphones and does not bother anyone with a loud TV set anymore."
REGWH1571R5K3,4,"I bought this for my dad with hearing problem as TV ear. He's been extremely happy for what it does: no more fight over volume level with mom, no more guessing on drama content and being able to enjoy music once again. Sound quality is not bad for the facts that it's radio transmitted and the price is less than 100. Highly recommended"
R1XYJQASXRIUT4,4,Worked great right out of the box. For the price I think they are great. there is a small amount of distortion and your ears will sweat with the right conditions. But battery life is long and it will go long distances away from house. I'm satisfied.
R3GNG1PDWC9A2W,4,"First I must say that when this item works, it works well.  However I am currently having an issue with the base turning off for a moment and then coming back on.  It's more of an annoyance than anything.  It's really odd, someone on TV will be in the middle of a sentence and the base will simply \\""go out\\"" and then immediately come back on within 2/3 seconds.  Other than that it works great, the sound quality is not the most robust I've ever heard but certainly the best from any wireless headphones I've ever used.<br /><br />On a side note many people complain of a hiss, but I found by turning up my source the hiss was eliminated even when there is silence from the source.<br /><br />Overall a very good product and I'm still looking into the power issue."
R1EAH1UH1OCIOS,5,Excellent for hearing details in speech with accents.      Also great for one person to watch TV while the other reads in the same room.  NO TV audio at all to interfere  with the reader but the person with the headset hears everything perfectly!  We love it.
RTPZB7K21RC6W,4,"I purchased these headphones when they were on a \\""gold box\\"" special - it was an impulse buy.  Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Comfort - the headphones fit comfortably, and are balanced enough in the weight department that they don't feel intrusive when wearing them for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Sound Quality - Sennheiser excels in this department, and these cans are no different - they sound great with a wide response range.  I use them for gaming and streaming my music while I work around the house.  As long as you are not receiving any wireless interference, they sound splendid.<br /><br />Controls - The controls are fine on this unit, although one complaint I have (and I can't think of a better category than controls for this one) is that they \\""shut off\\"" too quickly when no sound is coming across.  I understand this is to save battery life, but when I'm working on a computer, sometimes it takes a minute or two for me to get into the application I am going to work with.  If no sound comes across, the transmitter shuts off, causing static in your ears.  Not horrible, but annoying.<br /><br />Wireless Reception - Great! I have a large yard (2 acres), and was able to walk the length of it before getting any static.  One caveat, however, is that sometimes turning your head the wrong way, even when in close proximity to the base, will cause some static to occur.  I'm not sure this is indicative of any flaw in the headphones, however, and more likely due to something interfering in the frame of my house.  But, when they do come in, they come in very clear.<br /><br />Fit - The headphones \\""fit\\"" fine, but if you lower your head to pick something up, they inevitably fall off.  I've had to grab them from the air on their way down several times.  Now, this is kind of a catch-22 for me, because I wouldn't want them to be any tighter on my head, or the extended comfort would suffer.  Not sure what to say here other than if you don't lean over, they fit great.  If you do lean over, be ready to catch them as they fall off your head.<br /><br />Battery Life - I can't honestly say that I've had them run down enough to know how long they would actually last, but this is a non-issue for me, because I've never had them run out on me, even with hours of music playing as I work around the house.  The fact that the base charges them while they are \\""put away\\"" is enough that the battery life just doesn't become an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall - I do recommend these if you are looking for some great headphones to wear while gaming or listening to music streaming from your computer/stereo.  They have great range, battery life is a non-issue due to the charging base, and they feel great even after wearing them for hours.  A great buy.em as they fall off your head.

R2UZFZRH2DGTQ1,1,"Even at the smallest setting, it slid off my head at the tiniest motion. As such, complete useless, and returned to Amazon."
R2QNLWJZC6P6VR,5,"These Sennheiser headphones are great.  If you are looking for some to watch TV, get them.  My husband used to turn up the TV real loud and with the living/dining/kitchen connected he made it very stressful & I was always grouchy.  We were always fighting about it.  I searched on Amazon & found these headphones & just ordered them as a \\""surprise\\"".  He tried them &  said they were great.  The ear cups are very comfortable & he wears them all evening watching TV with Direct TV.  I can now even play rock music on the radio in the kitchen while he watches a movie & he can't hear the radio & there is no loud TV with those awful blasting commercials.  We have not had to change the batteries either.  We have had the product about 9 months.  Totally satisfied.  Ours is connected to the TV.  Don't delay -- order these headphones now.  I am considering a second pair for vacations -- a quiet motelroom and/or RV would also be sweet!  The price is cheap for such quality headphones."
R1O4ZO36L239LC,4,"I have 2 problems - both of which this product has solved.  1.   I have significant hearing loss and very loud tinnitus (ringing of the ears). I often miss dialog that is either 'mumbled', or otherwise masked by music or background noise.   2.   My living room is (unfortunately) right next to my kitchen, and I find it difficult to hear the TV when people are talking in there, or somebody is doing the dishes. Normally, I have to turn the TV to  ridiculous volume to drown out the sounds - which works during dialog - but painful when the commercials kick in at twice the volume.    I hooked these up to the RCA out of my TV - and poof, I have perfect sound. On many TV's including mine, the RCA's are not variable - meaning that the only volume control that affects the headset is on the headset - but this is perfect for me. Sometimes I can watch TV late at night without anyone complaining that it's too loud for them - because the TV volume is off. I've wanted these for over a year and kept putting it off for the fear of being disappointed.... What a waste of time. I LOVE these things.     BTW, audiophiles will love these. Sonic quality is excellent. Bass is fairly rich, but not overpowering, and the highs (where most of my hearing loss is) are crisp.      Highly recommended!!!!!!"
R1OVDTPL5NNAXW,5,"I have gone through many headsets over the years, mostly wired. This is the absolute best bang for the buck I have ever experienced. The set works as advertised. and puts out sounds that I have not heard on more expensive sets, example, in the game Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood I now detect the faint sound of spurs when the character in riding a horse. I have never heard this sound before. I have not detected any static whatsoever. I very much like how I just turn the headset off, place it on it cradle and it recharges the batteries for the next day. I have had some all day sessions and the batteries have not failed once. When you consider performance vs. cost... WOW"
R331BO15DWX8UM,5,Some of the reviews say that the headphones are too big for the head. These headphones are replacing a pair that I had from another manufacturer. I have to say that the Sennheiser RS120 headphones are just as good if not better then my previous pair which cost considerably more.
R2BYTQCWH721LN,5,"I needed a new set of wireless headphones. Checked reviews of several on Amazon and other websites.    I found a great deal (pricewise) for Sentry Full-Size Wireless Headphones 2 pk. - HO-802 on Target website for $49.99. Two headsets! I bought it and tried it. While sound was great, I didn't like the background noise (constant low hiss). Not pleased with it, I ordered Senheiser RS120 from Amazon.    This is a beaut when it comes to sound quality. Excellent sound, no hissing noise in the background. If you happen to get some noise, you can always adjust with the headset tuner or by changing the channel(3 channels) on the base unit. Another nice feature I liked was that the base acts like a stand and also recharges when the headset is not in use. The unit came with 2 rechargeable batteries,    One improvement this headset could use is the adjustability of the headset. It kept slipping off my head when I was exercising on the treadmill. It was a bit too big for me. I found a simple solution for it.. a bandana over the headset will do the trick.  All in all, I recommend Senheiser RS 120."
RMY5IASS36G44,4,This rechargeable unit is a replacement for a Sennheiser unit. The previous died after about 3 years.  The new unit performs well.  The instructions for setup and maintenance are severely lacking.  It gave no charging instructions. Should it recharge after every use or wait until the batteries run down? The installation instructions did not address if you have a cable/satellite box or just a stand alone TV. If I had not had a previous model it would have been very difficult to install. I only got another Sennheiser because of their reputation in this product line.  I hope this unit lasts longer than 3 years.
RAPVUU2K8K2BD,5,Good reception throughout the house.  I can venture upstairs to check on something and still hear the football plays.  Cradle charger keeps unit ready for use every time.  I can now watch all the games with the TV set volume off while my wife watches her favorite shows on another set in the next room.
R3EDN6DEJNBP8V,5,"My husband wanted a headset badly.  I started checking on best buy and other stores, read reviews and trusted the product.  My husband couldn't be happier, reception is great, it is not heavy(so he says)even though it looks like, the price @ amazon was much more cheaper and it came really fast considering I requested regular mail."
R1I0CBMZYDXUZX,4,"Lets revisit some of the issues others have discussed:<br />  1.  Hiss - yest there is hiss, BUT only when I get almost out of range.  I have not found it necessary to hold my head rigid or in strange positions.  Hiss is not really a problem for me or the wife.  (Note: you will get lots of hiss if the input level is too low.  Try using line out instead of audio out)<br />  2.  Volume control too close to the tuner.  Well, since I can shift and clutch while chewing gum, I have not yet found this to be a real problem.  Takes almost no practice to get it right - just start high and work down for the volume.<br />  3.  Range - I lost the signal completely at about 300 feet thru walls and trees.  Sound quality began to deteriorate and hiss increased at around 250 feet.  Even had to face the \\""right\\"" direction and hold my head in funny positions to get good sound past 250 feet.  Working in the garage or most of the yard, I had really good sound.  Since some of my yard is well beyond 300 feet - I could not get good reception at all times and places - not at all a deal breaker for me.<br />  4.  Sound quality.  These are NOT as good as listening to a recording with a high quality sound system or thru my Bose home Theater System.  They are intended to provide very good sound quality with complete freedom of movement.<br /><br />WAIT - Solved some of the negative reviews.  These headphones work great in my house.  I actually purchased them for my mother - she lives in an assisted living center.  When I tried to install them in her room, I found out that the wireless phones used by 90% of the residents interfere with the system.  There is no way to tune the headphone system with all of this interference around.  I use a newer cordless phone that operates on different frequencies, but your phones may be the problem.  Electronic interference is probably the reason for the hisssssss problems.<br />  5.  Headphone comfort and fit.  Not as comfortable as some other headphones I have used and/or owned.  Quick moves can cause the headphones to slip off your head.  Maybe it is just me, but this can cause some problems and could be fixed.  Not a deal breaker, but get used to wearing them before you move around a lot.  I would not wear them if I were going jogging.  Overall I would still recommend these headphones.  I feel that there are enough good things to offset the fit.r owned.  Quick moves can cause the headphones to slip off your head.

R2R3NMR8SDEXP7,5,I purchAsed this headphone set to replace one that had been damaged.  It was everything I expected and more.    I love the headphones and they work the entire length of my house.
R1IYU1QD7QK3EN,5,"I used to be unable to enjoy the sound of a movie on TV.  I only heard the background music rather then the speech.  Not anymore with my Sennheiser Headphones.  It's just like being in a movie theater, I absolutely love them and so does my wife.  They also are very simple to hook-up. Best money I ever spent!"
R1KWA70U5PQC79,1,"Power supply seems to shut off...headphones work for about 30 minutes, then just shut down while sound should be coming through...it is connected to my TV and there is no \\""dead silence\\"" on the television...lights on the charger go out...I unplug it, plug it in again and they come back on, and earphones will transmit for about another 10 minutes, maybe...then shuts down again.  Often when earphones are being worn, everything shuts down and I get nothing but static...could it be that my power supply (I live in a rural area in the mountains of AZ) is not up to snuff?  Could it be that I live in a manufactured home (not a mobile home or trailer) and there is an abundance of metal used in the construction of such a structure?  Could it be that I got the only bad set of earphones in the bunch? Maybe the equipment would work somewhere else...it just doesn't work here where I am.  Great disappointment.  And, by the way, I paid more for this item on Newegg than is advertised here, but they are going back today!"
RVXJOMG4CMQRQ,4,These things are great.  I gave them as a gift for a person who likes to have the TV a little too loud.  I've recieve good reviews.  I have put them on a couple of times and the sound is crisp.
R3LXLVOC1HVQXL,4,Love the fact I can listen to the TV at night when my spouse is sleeping. Even after adjusting the tuning mechanism I still hear background noise. Any suggestions?
R2OSST3KZGM41Q,5,"Initially I was concerned about some of the negative reviews.  I've purchased this product over a month ago and it has exceeded my expectations.  I am by no means an audiophile, but the sound quality is great and no noise (or interference) I can detect.      I use it in the bedroom, which is on the second level of my house.  I positioned the transmitter base at the top of armoire (TV cabinet).  I can receive reception outside the house as far away as my mailbox (about 40 ft)."
R3T4IL3OHLZMOS,5,"NOW I DO NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE FOOTBAL GAMES OR FOX NEWS ALL DAY.  MY HUBBY PUTS ON THE HEAD PHONES, MUTES THE TV. AND I HAVE PEACE AND QUIET.  THESE SENNHEISER WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE WORTH A MILLION BUCKS TO ME. HE IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY AND SEPARATION OF THE SOUND.  HE CAN ALSO STILL HEAR THE GAMES WHILE DOING OTHER THINGS IN OTHER PLACES.  TO THINK HE GAVE ME A HARD TIME FOR ORDERING THIS \\""PEICE OF JUNK\\"".  I AM SO GLAD I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT.  THEY WERE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED BY MY AUDIOLOGIST FOR MYSELF.  I LOVE THEM!  I RECOMMEND THEM."
R2GU0LMSPHEFDS,4,"I use the headphones for watching and listening to online classes and podcasts. I love being able to walk around the house and not lose the audio. Before I was stuck to the computer with my wired headphones. Reception is always excellent, very clear. My only problem is that after a while, my ears get hot and the earphones start to feel heavy."
RRY2Z3P922RSC,3,The Sennheiser wireless worked far better than top competitor Sony. The headset I received was apparenly a second - the headset had been stretched so large that Andre the Giant couldn't keep in on his head. There was no way to get a replacement headset.
R2RDBT2M4DRO2F,3,"These are good quality wireless headphones. 120' range - maybe on the moon. Same room - yes. Nice charging technique. I thought the wireless headphones got better in the last 20 years. However, this one has the same qualities as the old Sony I bought 20 years ago."
R3852J9O09JT91,1,All I had was static. I sent it back no trouble doing this.  No trouble with receiving my refund.
RYQIJ2B7B5T3R,5,"Great headphones, and excellent quality sound. Easy to use, and comfortable. I'd recommend these to anyone!"
R202EN59B7RH4P,1,"#1. The static & hiss of the FM frequencies just don't work.  I tried all the channels, and clearing the receiver away from electronic devices.  Still, hisses when you move, loses the channel occasionally, static at other times.  The distortion is absolutely maddening!  Must be poor quality control on their part.  It's a piece of crap.  Why pay for this product when for say, $10-20 more, you can get bluetooth headphones which NEVER hiss and have 100% sound transmission without interference.  This product is fail    #2. the materials are cheap and don't feel that comfortable on your head.   #3. the cheap materials don't dampen the sound very well outside, therefore, someone could be 10-20 feet away trying to sleep and STILL here the sound coming out of the earphones...    I'll be returning this and am looking for a bluetooth headset,"
R29LGT1LUEL5QD,5,"I had never heard of this company before,but for that price,I was willing to give it a try.GREAT CHOICE!!The sound is superb.Once I found the correct tune (you may have to adjust),the sound is really clear & crisp.With the tv turned down low,I can still hear the sound as if the tv is turned up loud.WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!"
RLPXA8DUTS0HJ,5,"I've had these headphones for a couple of months now, and I have no complaints. They're comfortable, offer good sound quality and range, and store and recharge nicely behind my big screen tv.  UPDATE: Years later, they still sound great, work impeccably, and are invaluable members of our family."
RKG8O6VGG4OKF,2,Hi!    It is not worth the price because it has lot of interference . The clarity is bad.
R2Y8LWFYH4J7KH,5,"Bought this for my wife to use in bed and it works great. No issues, very clear. No interference, just a great product at a good price."
R1F3I5G5JOSQ87,4,I am very happy with the quality of the sound of this product.  My only complaint is that the distance you can go from the charging cradle is shorter than my older speakers....same brand...which covered a much longer distance.
R2XFO8JLOBUCRM,1,"I bought this along with an extra headphone, to be able to watch TV at night without concern for loud sound. The package contains the charging base, headphone, charging adapter and stereo connector cable. After I connected the base to my computer using the stereo cable I turned on the headphone. Apparently the base receives the audio input and broadcasts it on an FM frequency for the headphones. There is a tuning dial on the headphone which should allow you to receive clear sound. However I could not eliminate noise interference while I was sitting about 6 feet away from the unit. The manufacturer's website states that to reduce interference you have to move the base unit away from other electronic devices, which I did, within the constraint of provided cables, with no relief. The noise is very annoying and sometimes deafening. I don't know how come my local radio stations broadcast FM signal that can be received clearly up to 100 miles but this unit cannot broadcast over 6 feet distances?  Definitely recommend against this product."
R3LP3FVHHMSA0H,4,"At 75 my hearing is poor. I'm a retired electrical engineer and was surprised to find the expensive hearing aids were annoying and didn't improve comprehensive much. Then I found my headsets produced much more normal sound and made music enjoyable again. The cord was an annoyance (as a young radio amateur I'd dragged a receiver off the desk more than once, a'la Wallace & Grommit). My brother had a wireless headphone on his TV (he was 89) and it sounded good. His hearing aids are also sitting in a drawer somewhere.    I bought a Sennheiser 120 wireless headset a couple of months ago and it's excellent. Music is very pleasant with lots of bass and the voices are clear. It's also nice to move around the home and not lose track of the radio programs. My hearing tests as very limited for the high frequencies, haven't heard the TV sweep oscillator in decades. I'm not sure why the phones are so superior to my hearing aids, it may have to do with the reflections within the room. Wireless phones are a welcome enhancement to life as a senior and I'd suggest others check them out."
R3ITYWAZY1LD6I,4,Purchased these for late night tv viewing. they work  very well. sound is clear and strong. they are comfortable as well. i recommend these.
RV0T9QOVW71PZ,5,"So far I love the Sennheiser RS120's. The range is incredible and the sound  is great especially for  value priced wireless headphones. I had another make  that cost twice as much and didn't hold a charge long, had very much static and  very short range reception.    Well, it's now March 16, 2010. I purchased these in August 2009 and they are still  great. Sound is wonderful. Range and battery life can't be beat.    Update Jul 15,2010.....still love them! Battery holds charge as good as new. Range and clarity can't be beat.    Update Mar 18,2011.....still love them! Battery still good as new! Highly recommend."
RVVK2YJZOZWA7,2,"Overall,  I'm not impressed.  The sound quality was decent but other thing like comfort,fit and material quality is why it scored low.  I feel for the money it should just be better."
R3N6XM58J5HLXU,5,"This review is for people who are using an older model t.v., and for those who are interested in using these headphones while running or walking on a treadmill.    These headphones almost received a one star review from me but before resorting to that I decided to try one more time to sift through some of the 950+ reviews others had written in hopes of getting to the bottom of and resolving a couple of issues.     In no way am I high tech so I will explain what was going on in the simplest of terms.  These were purchased for the sole purpose of using them while running on the treadmill.  Instantly they were awful with loud hissing and 'wind', while cutting out every few minutes, not to mention the random volume fluctuation that I still can't explain; certainly not what I expected based on most of the great reviews.    I tried every channel on the transmitter (receiver) and was always able to tune in with the headphones but it would only last a few minutes before it cut off and left me with just loud hissing.  When I did have it tuned in the hissing and wind in the background was just too much, not at all enjoyable.  I wondered if the treadmill was somehow interfering but decided it wasn't since the hiss was constant, not just when the treadmill was powered up.  I tried the volume on high on my older model t.v. - hoping to outblast the hiss.  No luck.    Taking advice from a fellow reviewer I unhooked the sound wires from my t.v. and plugged them instead into my DVD player, then turning the t.v. volume to zero and using only the headphones to control volume.  The difference that made is simply incredible.  Now I have clear, crisp, surround sound that sounds too good to be true.  I keep waiting for the transmitter channel to cut me off again but so far it hasn't.  The difference is like day and night.  I'm so glad I didn't send these back and leave a negative review.  If I could give these 10 stars, I would.  For the price, and with a little effort, they are the best.The other thing is the headphones are too big for my head and fall off while running.  My solution is to wrap a rolled up bandana around the top of the band, tying the ends in a loose knot on the top.  This removes all the slack and I am able to run comfortably with them on for long periods of time.  Not a problem removing the bandana before resting the headphones back on the cradle.  Don't really care what that must look like - it serves the purpose.    I blame my simple issues on the lack of adequate instructions and troubleshooting ideas - Sennheiser should have been more thorough, beyond the basic hookup, by sending a more detailed sheet of explanations with their headphones."
R3O59AGTD01JPK,4,Now we are able to listen to our favorites while moving around the house doing all sort of other activities. It is also a great tool for not disturbing others and forcing them to listen to a loud broadcast.
R2LJ8E3SQV0AZL,5,These earphones are terrific.  The tonal quality is great and the wireless reception is excellent.
RJOANEU5QSJFT,4,"Works great, almost as good as a wired pair. Though sometimes you'll get some loud feedback... but for the price I couldn't find anything close to the quality."
RQ5IO00L7NBXQ,3,The Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones met and exceeded my expectations except for one small problem. They wont stay on your head. Anytime you have to even slightly bend over they fall off. There isnt enough tension in the headphones to hold them on your head. You have to more or less balance them on your head.
R3RXMCYE38TGXC,5,I am hard of hearing and usually have to turn the TV up so loud it disturbs my wife.  Even then sometimes I cannot make out what is being said.  With this product I hear everything very distinctly & do not disturb anyone since I can mute the TV if I want to & listen with the headphones only. The other great thing is you can get up & wander anywhere in the house or garage & still hear what is going on.  Great for when the commercials come on & you want to do something while they are on.  You know when they are over to go back to watching the program.  The Headset is very comfortable & I have not had a problem with them falling off as others have mentioned.  All in all this is a great product for me & if you are hard of hearing you should try this. At first I experienced some static but tuned the set so that now I have no static whatsoever.  I love this product very much.
R2OP256T8BBS4U,1,"Poorly designed. I enjoyed these headphones -- until the AA batteries located in the left earphone began to corrode. The very porous foam of the ear cup sits directly on the batteries and terminals, allowing moisture (sweat, humidity, etc.) to damage the batteries. VERY disappointed. I finally trashed them after four months."
RN18G06WXVQCC,4,"No problem with item, Works as expected. Wee bit, on occassion, with minor distortion. However set works just fine when outside or in ajorning rooms."
R2Q3NTQOJK6EJ2,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones are a great buy. They work wonderfully. I liked them so much I bought a second set. One set for the computer and one set for the TV. Also my husband and I can watch TV together with our headphones. He can have his turned up loud so he can hear, and mine the way I like."
R1XZ8NWDDFQOAF,4,Bought this unit for a hearing-impared family member to hear the TV better.  I don't know who likes it better - him or the rest of us.  He hears the TV and the rest of us don't have to hear the TV too loudly.  One odd thing was it was not working one day - just picked up static.  I tTried it on another TV - nothing.  Hooked it back up the following day to the original TV just to make sure it wasn't working before contacting Amazon to return - it worked!  Go figure.  I hope it keeps working because we can't do without it now.
R1UJQ1CK0OJWT8,1,"UPDATE 8/31<br />I sent the phones back to Sennheiser for warranty service and they sent me a new pair. Turns out the refurbs I bought were defective. The replacement phones are working great. I wandered all over the house with them and the reception never wavered. The sound was surprisingly good, actually better than my inexpensive wired pair. Not audiophile quality sound of course, but still very good, and the freedom to move around more than makes up for it. I'm very satisfied. I would give these a 4 star rating if I could.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />First let me state that I bought a factory refurbished pair, so I may have had a defective unit. That said, my phones had poor quality sound on all channels and with all tuning settings. Besides poor sound quality, the signal quality was very weak, fading out in just a few feet. It was also very sensitive to even slight movements of the headphones. Very disappointing, and I have to assume that I probably own a defective pair, since there are so many positive reviews."
R1OCOBVWU8YBYC,5,"Having been very happy with the CX300 ear bud headphones, I decided to purchase these wireless headphones and find them to be fantastic. Perhaps more importantly, with all my Sennheiser products I have found the company's customer service to be excellent, considerate and personal. My CX300 earbuds stopped working after considerable use, but I was able to get a replacement pair quickly because I was within the warranty period, no hassle. The RS120s do sometimes have a bit of static, but hardly enough to bother me or lead me to return a product which otherwise produces great sound."
R32SGOA9KJBDQD,5,"I love this headphones.  The audio is crispy clear.  I can go to another room, or walk outside the house and still hear very clear.  I highly recommend this set of headphones.  I bought it refurbished, but the quality is as good as a new one!"
R1YGAIONDG5TV3,3,"What else is there left to say. ;)<br /><br />I bought a these off of Amazon a year ago. Fast shipping (BTW).<br />The sound is good. Not as good as My Koss Pro4AA, nor as good as my Sony in-ears.<br />But, they don't have a cord which makes them perfect for guitar practice. ( one cord to the guitar is plenty to keep up with.)  So Here's the rub.  The Auto Gain Control in the transmitter is constantly riding the gain up and down to compensate for loud and soft passages in music, which is fine for many styles of music that have few dynamic changes, but is very bad for Progressive rock and Classical. One way around the AGC issue is to keep the input volume low enough for the AGC to go to max gain, but the side effect is more hiss during the quieter sections of music.<br /><br />The good: Very Nice Hz response, Light weight, good for tv (the AGC reduces the commercial volume), good for FM radio which used a lot of gain riding already.<br /><br />The bad: No AGC disable switch"
R22MJAZ31VGAP7,3,"Straight to the point:<br />-Sound quality is so-so. Not that good.<br />-Limit on the maximum dynamic volume is far too low. In other words, it cuts off the frequency even when it's not too high. >>>> (Number one issue. Seriously, extremely annoying when listening to music, which I primarily use for, on my computer or iPod.) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />-Uncomfortable:<br />1. Too heavy<br />2. Too bulky (you can't sleep/lie your head to the side with it. Comes off easily + extremely uncomfortable if you do)<br />3. Comes off your head easily if you bend down due to its weight<br /><br />-Connection dies for less than a second once in a while even when you're only about 30-50 ft. away.<br />-Cheap looking materials for the base.<br /><br />I only listed the cons, but overall it's alright for a $80 wireless headphones. I guess you can't expect much with that price. I suggest buying a $100-150 wired headphones instead if you prefer quality. I'm gonna buy me another set of headphones with a much better quality.<br />Again, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PREFER QUALITY OVER PRICE."
R185SQFRYYS05N,5,"My husband has extensive hearing loss, & even with his hearing aids, he has to 'blast' the TV to even hear it.  My ears would be 'ringing' when the volume was so loud.  Even then, he would continue to miss words here & there & was always saying, \\""What did they say?\\""  It got to the point that I didn't even want to be in the same room when he was watching TV.  Well, after watching TV the evening before & going to bed with a splitting headache from the piercing volume, I decided I needed to do something to resolve this problem.  I got online, looked at a number of similar products, & somewhat reluctanty, ordered this set. The price was reasonable & they appeared to be a quality product. Those earphones have been a Godsend!  In fact now, when my husband is using them, he has the external volume so low that I have to ask him to turn up the volume for me. I was concerned the headphones might be 'heavy' but they really are light & comfortable.  On top of everything else, my husband has ADD.  He cannot sit through a TV program without getting up to go do something at any given moment.  When he'd come back in the room, he'd want to know what had happened on the program while he was elsewhere.  It used to be a huge bone of contention.  Well, wherever he wanders to now, he has his headphones on, inside or out, and he never misses the program because he can hear it wherever he is...even outside.  I have put a 'squash' on him listening to a program & being on the computer at the same time! I love, love, love these headphones, as does my husband...plus the fact that they have a charger where they rest when not in use.  I just ordered a second set for our bedroom.  I can't recommend these headphone enough!  They've made my life blissful!"
RQRCVCCANHH0E,5,Just as promised! The headphones were great. I don't hear any distortion even if I'm in a different room in the house. The charge last a long time too.
R1V9UETOX72A38,5,Easy to set up. Very comfortable to wear. Crystal clear sound. What more do you need? I love these headphones!
R248JTN7ULM04F,5,"I bought these at sears, $49.oo on sale. I did a lot of research first & found that users liked these. I work in a huge office complex and I can go all over the building w/ these. when you get about 50 to 75 feet the signal fades a little and may get a little clicking noise. for the most part they are awesome. if you have to work 25 plus feet from the transmitter you may get occasional fade but they are better than anything else in this price range."
R2B7BT7NOGV451,5,"I think these are a great headphone deal, cost to value wise. They are very simple to hook up, excellent sound quality, no static, no hiss, excellent head fit adjustment, lightweight and comfortable, and easy to use recharger. I read a few complaints and have to wonder if those people are expecting something too extraordinary for this price. It is an excellent value for anyone but the pickiest of consumers. Of course, if you are expecting the world from these headphones then perhaps you should buy a 3-400 dollar set. But this set should satisfy most people's needs."
R33UIULHG4X320,2,"I live in a condo building in Chicago and these headphones were unusable due to static and interference. Tried all three bands to no avail. Even standing 2' away from the transmitter, there was a quiet but audible hiss at all times plus bursts of static like you'd hear on the radio anytime I moved my head.    They did sound good, but the interference was just too much to bear."
R1L5VOPEAM0F2Y,4,The headphones really work great. I was surprised at how little (none) hiss could be heard once tuned properly. The only complaints were the earphones are pretty hard and don't surround your ear. They just rest on the surface of your ear. Also it seems the sound has a fluctuating tonal quality. I listen to old time rock and this doesn't affect what I hear. If I listened to classical it may bother some. I'm satisfied. I walked out to the garage while listening and it was 5 x 5. I'd recommend them to a friend.
R11JSVEE7U0WUN,2,"Great audio walking around the house. The signal is overall very good. Very comfortable.    Bad: These headphones are designed so that after 2 minutes of no sound being transmitted, (for example, you paused your iTune track) the transmitter turns itself off and all you get a sudden earful of LOUD static through the headphones. Don't count on wearing these if you want to turn your computer speakers off and just wear headphones at your desk for the occasional song or sound. If there aren't any sounds playing, you'll be blasted abruptly with loud static after the 2 minute timeout period. I wish there was a way to set how long that is -- 2 minutes seems way too short and it always happens abruptly."
R2P7XVPQ0IUALD,4,"Purchased these refurbished headphones to replace a cheap pair of Sentry headphones I bought in late '06 or early '07.  The Sentry's had a some static when I positioned a part of my body or my whole body in a certain way.  But the most annyoing and final reason why I switched was because my neighborhood seemed to have a number of power surges and when it did, it would cause the headphones to become completely static.  I would then have to get up from where I was sitting and turn the main box off and back on to reset the headphones and get my clear headphones back.  This obviously defeated the purpose of having wireless headphones if I had to constantly get up.  I had to conclude that the power surges were the reason for the sudden loss of sound because this never happened until I moved to the neighborhood, but the problem with some static with body movement was always there.      Ever since I got my reburbished Sennheiser RS120, I have been so much happier.  Sometimes there is a little static but no where near what the other headphones had and I have not had any power loss with the Sennheisers.  I also love how you can just drop the headset on the cradle and they automatically charge.  I thought I would hate it because I might forget to put the headphones back on the cradle the next morning but I have only forgotten once and have never had a problem with them running out of juice.  Great headphones.  Despite a little static, I would buy again."
R3A3S3P86E9Y8B,5,"The acoustics in my home are terrible. I needed headphones that were clear and easy to hook up.  The sound from these headphones are awesome! No white noise, no cracking, just wonderful, clear sound.  I now hear sounds from my TV programs I never knew were there. Highly recommended."
RIN9SNB60M0JQ,5,"A VERY EQUITABLE PRICE FOR THIS EXTREMELY QUIET, LIGHT, AND COMFORTABLE WIRELESS HEADSET!!! WORKS GREAT WITH MY ELECTRONIC DRUM SET - CRISP TREBLE ON THE SNARE, GREAT MID-RANGE DETAIL AND BASS RESPONSE ON THE TOMS AND KICK DRUM!!!"
R3LP2AM61M159J,4,"Great sound and very comfortable.  I wanted them for the bedroom and they work perfect.  I did not realize the stand would connect to the T.V. and because of the T.V. I have, it requires some dextrity to get the connection made.  I thought I could easily go from one t.v to a stereo but it requires taking the earphones and the stand.  However, I am not sorry I bought them."
RG9GHQOHDMYPG,5,"I was hesitant to buy these at first because some people on here said they had problems with interference, static, and low volume. I agree there is static when they are on and the tv is off, but honestly does it matter. For the ones who complain about not being able to hear the sound or it comes in static its probably your tv. I originally hooked it up through the audio out on the back of my tv. This way is crap, so i hooked it up to the audio outs on my Sat. Receiver and BAM instantly amazing. These are every bit worth there price. oh and dont forget they have a few channels to help tune away static."
R1CXZFUCZ2P96O,5,"Just got these in a few hours ago and haven't taken them off since. The only discomfort they make is with my earrings, other than that there is none.<br /><br />I disagree with the \\""hiss\\"", since when tuned in all the way to the base, there's really not one to hear unless you don't have music going (which will probably happen through every headphone). And it's only very slightly heard if you have classical type music on where the song volume gets lower than usual, other than those, it's not loud at all or bothersome. Went all the way across my house and the signal held on pretty well.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with them, I used earbuds before these (the earbuds I tend to use only for my PSP, so it's nice to have actual headphones for my laptop). Would recommend these to anyone!<br /><br />Edited to add: the headphone band on these sit back on your head. They're not meant to be centered on your head, or sit far up near your forehead. They also weren't meant to be adjusted in the band.. it doesn't adjust, and doesn't need to be. However, you can adjust them just above the phones, which seems to shift everything and improve the fit. I've been reading most people having problem with the \\""fit\\"" of these, and wanted to add."
R174A5N0CQ647N,5,"With young children in the apartment, I can finally listen to TV programs or the radio while doing chorse after they have gone to bed.  The sound quality is good enough, and they feel comfortable (after trying a few adjustments).  The re-charging stand is handy not only for recharging, but to give a 'home' for the headset to be placed after every use.  Static is minimal.  It helps to have the source volume high, and then use the headphone volume control to control the final sound output.  The wife and I are very happy about the Sennheiser RS120."
R2V7RIN0LOLLYF,5,"These stereo wireless headphones turned out to be more than quite acceptable, once I got the hang of it.  I am handicapped in that I am not able to use my hands or read between the lines trying to interpret the poor German \\""English\\"".  The instructions are poorly worded and illustrated.   In this day, companies should always use native language speakers to write their instructional texts.  No matter how good they think they are, their texts come out in 4th grade English.  After a while, I was able to figure out how to use this gadget, except for one thing- please provide a clearer explanation of the red/green light matrix.  Also, the tiny, fragile switches on the headset are hard to operate and read.  Otherwise, the headset provides clear, crisp sound, good separation and can be worn comfortably for several hours.  Thank you."
R3D1A0B6XN945N,4,"These headphones do come with RCA phono plugs contrary to some write-ups.  The US model always comes with them.  The sound quality is great, the fit and comfort is great.  I heard absolutely no hum or buzz like a few others mentioned.  The headphone positioning on the charge cradle is a little difficult at times but you just move them around a little and they will make connection.  I have no problem suggesting these to others."
R1S058FAWGF6ZE,5,"I was looking for a wireless headset for quite sometime now, was not sure which one to buy, as most of the reviews of all the wireless headsets were not encouraging. However, I decided to try RS-120 and got them from Amazon.    There is no user manual as such with the item. There are 3 or 4 loose sheets with different types of instructions which are not very descriptive.    I connected the transmitter to a wall socket and charged the headset for about 3 hours. I was not sure where to connect the RCA cable, as there were many holes on my LCD HD TV, and no headphone jack. I connected the RCA cable to back of my TV where it said \\""Audio Out - Line\\"". The transmitter light (green) did not turn on. There was some hiss in the headphone. I changed transmitter band and tried to tune headphone. Still no sound, but just hiss. I was bit nervous. Since I was not sure about TV RCA connection, connected the transmitter to my laptop audio output jack, using the supplied RCA-audio jack adapter (very nice accessory). The green light came on, and it worked!  Then I connected the transmitter back to the TV to the same RCA holes, and this time it worked! Good thing about this is the TV volume can be on or muted.    The sound quality is absolutely great, clear and stereo. The headphones are light and comfortable for continuous use. I have not yet checked the battery life or the range. But the headphones work clearly in all the rooms in my house."
R20GMVTDWGOVAF,4,"I don't think you can do better for $65.  I have two sets and one of the sets I got refurbished for $45.  I have had both sets for 6 months and they have been trouble free.  I have one set in the bedroom and one set in the family room.  They can operate at the same time on different channels with no interferance.  If a friend comes over, I'll grab the set from the bedroom and run both headsets off the family room transmitter.  I love having these to watch TV at any volume once my family goes to bed.  The set in the bedroom is for my wife so she can watch TV if I chose to go to bed early.  The recharging cradle/transmitter works great.  I never have to worry about the batteries like my old pair.  My only faults are with the sound at a high volume and how they sit on my ears.  I wished they would cup my ear instead of sitting on my ears but it really doesn't bother me that much.  The clarity of the sound is very good but music and soundtracks, especially when loud, could be better but remember, I only paid $65 for them.  I'm really not an audiophile and for most viewing, they are perfect.  I would recommend these to a friend without hesitation."
R2IESOBSJ41DLC,4,"I am very satisfied with these headphones. I first saw these at Fry's for a $120.00. I went home, found them on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased them for only 69.99! What a savings. Yes, you do hear a little hiss, but not more than you would expect for a wireless device. If you are using them to watch television, then you won't even notice the hiss. I wish that the headphones would stay on my head a little better. If I'm washing the dishes and look down, the headphones tend to want to fall off. Not that big of a deal, but I do wish they were a little tighter on my head. I highly recommend them to anyone wishing to use these for watching television."
R1U7ROP450Y13K,5,These headphones are great for watching TV programs and not disturbing anyone in the room with you.  The quality of the sound is better than I thought it would be  I would recommend this product to anyone for purchasing.  Great Price.
RKHJJ37GLZQX6,5,"I was a little confused by all the different styles and brands, even with all the convenient reviews on all of them, so I decided to go with a low end (price wise)set of wireless headphones to start for my bedroom HDTV (Plasma)  I ended up ordering 2 more of them for the living room TV, (Plasma) they worked out so well.  I would not recommend them for hours of movies, but the sound is great when you want to watch something late at night which I often do, without disturbing the rest of the household.  These installed very quickly, although the instructions are minimal, and I would comment that you kind of have to be electronic savvy for a smooth install.  Works great if you only want them because you can't hear the dialogue, which is a common occurance these days, and I am not hard of hearing. These do fit me (I have a small head) better than others that I have tried, but they will slide off if you bend over or move your head around so they do take a little fussing while you are watching.  The sound is great, and I don't see a need for surround sound sets, I can hear every special effect with these.  I was going to get a second headset for my husband, but the second headset cost almost as much as a whole unit, so I just got a second unit, so that I can use the charger.  Only one headset hangs on the charger cradle.<br /><br />MK"
R3DXJB10MARLF2,1,"I have only had these headphones for 3 weeks and they work great. The only problem I'm having is that I have another set of Sennheizer headphones and when both TVs are on, they interfere (even after changing frequencies)."
R3F9NPGIY9PNU3,5,"Great product, bought it for my father in law who has bad hearing. Mother in law can now listen to the tv  at a normal volume, while father in law can turn up the volume to his hearts content.  Extremly simple to use, great quality."
R3GO2076H4J36U,1,If they won't stay on your head there is no need to comment on the sound. I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the fit unless they have a square head. I have a fairly normal sized head and they are very loose fitting. They fall off when I move my head. Worst fit for head phones I have seen. I modified mine and they are somewhat improved but still objectionable. A waste of money.
R2M78I605GXTVA,5,"I usually don't write reviews, but I had to for this product. Like many people I went on Amazon trying to find a good wireless headphone system for watching TV at night when the kids and spouse are asleep. I looked at many products and saw good and bad reviews for each. The Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle received a lot of very good reviews. Of course there were also folks that had problems with the system. So, I was a little nervous about the purchase. I received the unit on 7/1/09 and set it up to charge for 24 hours as recommended by the user guide. I hooked it up to the audio out on my AT&T U-Verse cable box, turned on the headset, tune the channel and bingo the audio was streaming to the headset. Wow! This thing sounds great, it has bass, clear audio and a bonus I was able to go to any room in a 2 story 3000 square foot house and the signal quality remained the same. I was blown away. I'm in the technology field and it takes a lot to impress me, this impressed me, period. You owe it to yourself to try this unit, if you don't like it, I would be very, very surprised. My wife and little girl tried it and they love it... we can't wait to have an opportunity to use it. I plan to watch a movie tonight with it on and for once I will not hear my little girl say \\""daddy please turn the TV down\\""... priceless... Did I mention that the headset is very comfortable? Well it is. Enjoy!"
R1QT16KZHYID5R,5,"Purchased it for my girlfriends father. He loves it. Allows him to listen to the TV while running on his treadmill without having to blast the volume on the TV. Great quality sound. I have tried it as well, its a pretty cool gizmo."
R1WEV5DJO8WDGH,5,"I was nervous that these headphones would have static, etc-  I am happy to say that the sound quality is great!  These headphones and the charging stand have a high quality feel and look.  They work just fine with my plasma television.  I am very pleased with my purchase."
R14ACNY5CTYRDH,4,"The price is good and the sound quality is good the size is a bit small for my head,"
RZU0NLQMOCO6,4,PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED AND EXPECTED UNTIL IT FALLS OFF YOUR HEAD.  I TIED A CORD ONTO EACH OF THE ENDS OF THE HEADBRACE WHERE IT MEETS EACH OF THE EARPHONES.  KEEPS IT FROM FALLING OFF WHEN I BEND MY HEAD FORWARD.
R33465U2LQCUVT,1,"I've spent over two hours trying to find the right frequency setting so I don't get very noticeable interference while listening to music. Plus if I stop listening to music for two minutes or so, and forget to turn off the headphones, they go into some kind of standby mode which blasts VERY LOUD noise into my ears. I'm returning and going back to wired."
R1TZ50ONQYHGW5,5,"These wireless headphones are really awesome! The base unit comes with a phono plug to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter, and then a 3.5 mm headphone jack to left/right RCA audio adapter. The base unit has nice, long RCA cables on it. They are not heavily shielded or anything, but they are on par with a good set of headphone wires.<br /><br />The wireless has worked awesome for me! No static or noise or any interference! I was worried that there might be a slight amount of static due to all of my computer and electronic devices planted only inches away from the Sennheiser base unit. I have not had a single issue at all! Amazing!<br /><br />The headphones have a on/off switch on the left ear cup. It also houses the 2 x AAA batteries (rechargeable ones that were included). The right ear cup has two dials. One for volume, and one to tune the headphones. The volume is fine, no problems. However, I find the \\""tune\\"" dial to be a little archaic. The base unit itself has a toggle switch that lets you select between 3 channels. I have 3 units, all set to different channels, so I can tune into which ever one I want to at the time, and my brother and sister can too. I would have preferred a similar switch to have been present on the headphones, even though it is easy as pie to tune the signal in, and you have a good wide range where you get superb sound (unlike some tuning devices where you have that magical sweet-spot that is harder than a fruit-cake to get perfect so you don't have static). The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head. Not too bad, considering they have batteries and all.<br /><br />The price is not too bad! And, being made by Sennheiser, these headphones are great! If you are looking for a wireless headset, I recommend these, unless you are looking to spend MUCH more, or are willing to gamble on quality. I was amazed to find the Sennheiser RS120's at such a great price and such awesome performance!ce!"
R4NC9HMF3YQ67,2,"Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no problem with the fitting of the headphones or the charging cradle.  And I really don't want to attribute the 2 star review to the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones.  Although our TV is not ancient, it is an older model and although I tried every conceivable hook-up there was and let the headphones charge for more than the 24-hour period, I could never get rid of the constant static.  Finally, after a fair amount of trial and error, I repackaged them in the original boxes and applied for an online refund with Amazon (my very first refund), printed out the labels and authorization and returned it to Amazon.    Of course, I was disappointed because they seemed like good headphones but not compatible with our TV.  I had no problem with the return and it was convenient to apply and get the necessary labels online."
RW4DAZF7NGJ8Z,4,"good reception, battery life good (we'll see how they age)  flat earcup design causes the headphones to slip off with abrupt head tilts - better for wearing while sedentary than while moving around"
R2HTH1T5XE4AFW,5,I am very satisfied with this product. Good sound quality  and gives me mobility around the office.
R1ZOI5E34GG2A7,4,"Everything has been said in 922 previous reviews . I found a headphone jack 3.5 mm jack for the computer and a set of RCA audio jacks in my package . I have Fibro and severe chronic pain . Zero quality of life until I put these on WOW . I own a acre and a third with a house at one far end . I walked to every point on my property after closing the door to the house and setting these up on the wall 3 feet above my computer and had no problems until I ducked behind a old Wells cargo trailor 400 feet away . Otherwise I did get some crackle but it was no worse then old vinyl scratches . My garage is behind the house I walked in with closed the doors and there was a van between me and the house and I heard everyting fine . The charging cradle is fine . Its easy to change the batteries and it came with rechargeables . Bottom line it works well . Sounds were crisp within reason for the crackles and pops . It scared me to think the radio waves were everywhere . I thought the bass was great . I like the position of the dials its not confusing . There is a adjustment on the base that helped me lock in a signal everywhere . Now the bad .<br /><br />These headphones are for people sitting or walking easy . When I tried to bend over with them they fell off . I didnt get on my lawn mower but it would be about as far as I would push activity with them . They feel clumsy and akward for me and I imagine most people . I wore them as small as they would go and I am a 7 5/8 hat size . Maybe my ears are high on my head I dont know . Compared to the technology I knew these are a 6 but take two off for a 4 on a 5 point scale . Definitely worth the money but dont expect to do work in them you will have to find another model . I would love to hear what people are using for that . The range for me was unbelievable compared to what I expected . I never believed the claims . Now you do have to tune them in and adjust a little . My base was hung on a simple paneling nail on the wall above the computer with a light switch a foot away , air conditioner running , monitors , tv and a wireless phone system . No problems . The volume turns up just high enough to be pleasant yet safe . A very good purchase . These replaced a nice set of RCA's which sadly were lost before the package was even openned . I couldnt buy them again and I dont feel sad anymore . I would buy again but hopefully the other pair will be something for working outside now that I know the tech can reach out there . These would be great for landscapers just leave the truck radio on with the base plugged into a inverter 12vt charge pack . I will comment later as I havent tried them with tv or just the computer alone yet to run into issues where people complain of the auto shut off / gain feature . I cant wait to try these with a usb phono I bought recently for my old 45's ,78's and 33's . For one brief moment my pain was bearable it was worth the money . Please recomend in comments a headset that may work with the base or not that is wearable while bending or being more active . Thanks ..God Bless .ith a light switch a foot away , air conditioner running , monitors , tv and a wireless phone system . No problems . The volume turns up just high enough to be pleasant yet safe .

R1HCH91M9SDUX4,4,"Very happy with this product. My wife and I use this for when we are on the treadmill and it works very well. Only downside: I think they could make the ear piece a bit more comfortable. Other than that clear reception, great sound and definitely worth it for the price."
R3FBXVJI0I90ND,4,"I have owned the RS120's for a month now and just love them. The clarity and deep rich sound was a nice surprise to me. The fit is comfortable and not bad for a couple of hours. The hissing sound they emit sometimes can be fixed by fine tuning the set and over all I find my headphones a delight to use. And by the way the range is about 60 feet before you start hearing the background noise. They may not be the best on the market but they are 2 thumbs up for the price and high quality, making them a great buy.."
RMS35SSMAMJ1A,5,I am very happy with these headphones.  I am hard of hearing and I can listen to the TV and movies with the volume set for me and not too loud for my wife and others. They are comfortable. The only negative is that they will fall off easily.
R3SUMXWUGH9JPX,5,"I bought these so I can watch and HEAR tv late night without disturbing my wife.<br /><br />The sound is amazing, with deep bass and crystal clear sound. As for reception I can go downstairs and still get a clear signal even trough concrete walls.<br /><br />They fit very comfortably, but rather loose, which is great to watch tv, but if you plan to use them and walk around you'll have to be carefull not to drop them."
R3T8ET2T9W42AT,1,I do no know who will see this but I would very much like to return these headphones. They work ok I guess but the problem comes with the AGC. The AGC clips the audio no matter what the input level. I turn it up and it turns it down. I am not trying to blow my ears out mind you. I am simply playing my computer music and mixing it with my normal electric guitar amp. A funtion that I use all of the time with standard headphones. How ever with these wireless the AGC makes it pointless. Who can I talk to about a return. I have purchased many a product from Amazon with no problem but now that there is a problem I see no avenue to find resolution. Can anyone at Amazon please help me. Please contact me via this email address.
R1G4UH99WR4C6K,1,"I ordered this for my husband's birthday. Sadly, it was defective -- when you plug it in it's supposed to start charging, and this one never did. Pretty lousy birthday surprise, eh?    But wait, it gets worse. Because I ordered it in advance of my husband's birthday, to make sure I got it in time, my 30 day \\""return window\\"" had expired by the time we discovered it was defective. So, Amazon refused to replace it for me, and actually charged me a $17 \\""restocking fee\\"" for the privilege of taking back a completely non-functioning product!     Moral of the story:     1) Don't buy Sennheiser Wireless headphones and   2) Don't buy electronic products from Amazon.    Kathryn Campbell"
REJ4MCTEUVCYF,5,"Sennheiser headphones perform as advertised.  Superb sound, very convenient to use, no interference anywhere in the house.  If you are considering buying TVEars, don't."
R2499T870M4IYP,5,"Works great. I got it for my young daughter so she could stop breaking headphone wires. She loves them. She can now wander as far as about 300' from the base station while listening. The one weakness is it is all too easy to change the tuning. Still, it is an excellent product that solved a problem for us. $62 wireless headphones is a lot cheaper than repeatedly buying tethered headphones.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />-Walter<br />[...]"
R189CW3F1NLKI4,2,"The sound quality was the same as a $20 pair I bought 2 years ago.  I was expecting more.  The cheap ones (bought at W%al M%art online) still work, I just needed another pair for the office, and I thought I would move up.  Both have good reception and good audio.  If you start out with a more expensive pair, you won't have any complaints, but you'll never know that you could have gotten the same quality sound for $20."
R1LFBB9G699Z8P,5,I can now watch all my action movies with the volume up and not disturb the Mrs....
R2CYM3ZB6L71R9,1,"I thought a product with so many good reviews couldn't possibly be a horrible product but it happened. Similar to other bad reviews, it took forever for me to hook up the charging cradle because it would only fit and stay if you held it at a certain angle. Sent it back after numerous tries. I really wanted this to work but it just didn't. The headphones did fit quite nicely though, but I could get nice wired headphones cheaper than this"
RBWT7COW2AEV4,1,"The ear pad are hard and the press on the ear making these very uncomfortable to wear, I sent them back."
RQQHXGS4FYFEL,4,"These work very well.  The price makes it a great deal.  I've got these hooked up to Zone 2 of my receiver.  This lets us have one thing on the main speakers (\\""the game\\"") and something else (\\""music\\"") on the headphones.  That way I can watch the game and my wife can listen to music at the same time.      The reception is good and setup was a breeze.  The headphones are a little bit loose and it might be better with pads that fully enclosed around your ears.  It'd also be nice if there was a little LED light on the headphones to let you know if they are on or off."
R1AVI0CQH4T73,5,I had another brand of head phones to listen to my TV but they used batteries and I had to change them every 2 weeks at the best.  The sound on the old ones was fair but the sound on the Sennheiser RS120 is 100% better and the rechargable feature is what makes these headphones the best.  I can now watch movies without missing things such as whispering that I would have trouble hearing before.  This allows me to set the volume to my liking without making it to loud for others to enjoy and they can adjust the sound to their liking on the TV volume.   Jim C. Sacramento
R37K2FWVKTI3MJ,4,"Having earlier purchased the Sennheiser RS 130 wireless headset, I wanted to purchase a wireless unit for our exercise room.  Since we only use our treadmill a few times a week, I thought that rather than spend the extra money on the RS 130, I would downgrade to the RS 120.  After having used the new headset a few times now, here is my assessment.    The RS 120 works well when playing back from a Sony TV (use the monitor output rather than the standard audio output since that gave me more static and needed the TV volume to be up).  I think, however, that the RS 130 has some different circuitry and has less static, but the RS 120 was certainly acceptable.  The 130 feel more secure on your head, and has ear pieces that surround your ears rather than just cover the ear as the 120 does.  As other reviews mentioned, the 120 is much looser on your head and doesn't feel as substantial as the 130, but it doesn't slide off me even when moving on the exercise equipment.  Charging seems about the same, but I haven't had to recharge yet.    The conclusion - I would rather have the RS 130, but for the $40+ difference in price, you should certainly consider the RS 120, especially if you are not using it for prolonged periods or strenuous movement.  If that is an issue, spring for the additional dollars."
R1PSLR9Q0L71ZC,4,"I purchased this headphone almost entirely based on all the positive reviews from this website.  When I got it I started playing around, and I was shocked by sudden, seemingly random static bursts.  These were very loud and nearly knocked me off my feet.  After a few of these, I developed a slight fear of these headphones.  Because of my fears, I lowered the volume settings...of course this deteriorated my listening enjoyment because it also increased general hissiness.  I was regretting my purchase about now.  But after reading few other reviews here more carefully, I decided that the problem, at least for me, was that I didn't have my input volume up high enough.  Now I set the volume fairly high and set the volume level on the headphone itself a little lower.  This managed to remove most of the hiss I hear.  So for all you new purchasers, make sure to have the input volume set pretty high!  I still get a few static breaks here and there, but it's manageable.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
R1BLY178VFMAR6,5,"THESE HEADPHONES ARE TRULY OUTSTANDING.  I LIKE TO WATCH OLD MOVIES LATE AT NIGHT - WITHOUT BOTHERING ROOMMATES NEXT DOOR.  I GET PERFECT SOUND, NO MATTER WHAT THE VOLUME, AND I DON'T REALLY NOTICE THAT I'M WEARING THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE.    GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY."
R26R7JYUP27PX7,5,"I purchased my 1st set at Video Only for $95 (including tax). These are replacing a Sony set I bought a few years back.   I was very surprised how there is no static during the quiet moments. I have them right next to my TV, cable box and DVD player and still no static or hissing. I threw away the Sony headphones!!!  Very good sound. I watched Transformers and I felt the surround sound effect with the headphones.   I was so impressed, I bought a second set from Amazon for $67. Good buy for the money."
R21AXN16A25O67,1,"I bought this based on reviews, upgrading from Sony wireless headphones, for TV use.  Comfort - outstanding.  Everything else - Horrible.  The unit would go off after being plugged in after only a few seconds, tried it various places in the house, and eventually returned it.  Glad I bought it on Amazon, where I could return easily.  Went back to the Sony brand."
RIJYN81CTLL2U,4,"I've been looking for a set of wireless headphones for awhile and after finding these and reading reviews, decided to purchase them.    I was pleasantly surprised by them, the set up easy and they are easy to use. The sound quality is very good and range seems to be good. We live in a small apartment so don't need a lot of range, but I'll find out when we move into our new place.    They are comfortable to wear, although I don't wear for long periods. I wouldn't recommend them for strenuous activities, but are nice to wear.     If I were to recommend one thing, is that to make the base unit powered by either battery or adapter. I use it for my XM radio and also with my laptop and ipod, so I'd like to move it around and being corded not the most convenient, but that is a small thing.    Glad I bought the headphones and look forward to many years of use."
R30O97IDV79WNS,4,"I needed something for my elderly mother who is has somewhat diminished hearing...she was to visit us and in the past it was necessary to turn up the TV to levels beyond what is comfortable for people with normal hearing...I purchased Sennheiser because I have one of their professional mics and figured Sennheiser audio quality would be OK...it worked great for my mom...I have used them and two complaints are (1) in a digital world why is it necessary to have an analog tuning knob...once it was tuned in I taped over it to prevent accidentally moving it...and (2) while the sound quality is acceptable (NOT audiophile quality), I do find that the distance rating is probably on the generous side...it works great within 30' or so, but once you get beyond that and you are walking around be prepared for some occasional drop-outs. Also, two great side benefits...great for the wife that doesn't want to hear your football game...also great for guys that don't want to hear the wife complaining about the football game!! I would purchase again."
R3UD062Z6L8IVH,5,Excellent fidelity. Good range (at least 40ft.) comes with rechargeable batteries and recharging holding cradle. Relatively comfortable for long listening.  A very good buy.
R1OBLF292P713Q,4,"I got these to listen to the TV while on the treadmill.  Setup was very easy.  As some others have noted, I do get some hiss, but I was able to adjust them to minimize it.  For me I'm on the treadmill so it's kind of loud anyway, so it doesn't bother me at all."
R2TGXS6GTRAP7H,1,"These headphones are incredibly cheap, poorly constructed, and worthless. I just threw them across the room. They won't stay on your head. They are finicky about staying on. The sound quality is terrible, full of barely audible hiss and rumble. I can't believe anyone can give these a good review, they are crap! They come with two RCA plugs for some reason, when I put the RCA's into the headphone jack of my computer, they fit so loosley that I had to fiddle with them to get sound"
RBNJ5ILRJ4XYT,4,For the price these headphones are awesome. The only downfall I can see is the hiss from the auto gain and there is no noise filtering. They wouldn't be a great set of headphones for a plane (need noise filtering) but if you are looking for headphones to watch a movie in surround w/o waking the rest of the house it doesn't get much better!
R1IY0CPUEI4XDX,1,"The product works fine however in the offer was a set of free CX 300s.  Be very careful you send the correct bar code.  I apparently sent the wrong one, threw away the box and am now out of luck on the freebie.  The company that handles this for Sennheiser has no contact capability for customers."
R1W27V4FE9WJ7C,5,"I've had this item for about 7 weeks and it works great. I use it exclusively for TV audio (I use wired Grado headphones for music). I don't hear any of the \\""clicks, hisses, or other noises\\"" that some of the other reviewers have mentioned, but I live in a small town and we probably don't have all of the interference that a large town or city would have. These work very well for TV audio because they don't have the deeper bass tone that many other headphones have, so they are better with the spoken word. I had been using a wired Sennheiser headphone for TV for years as I was skeptical about the quality and performance of wireless headphones, but the RS120 headphones completely changed my thoughts."
R9NOS62HJI5PR,5,I purchased these wireless headphones so I could listen to the TV while exercising on the treadmill. I can also listen to a music CD while I walk throughout the house doing chores. The sound is great! The battery charging cradle is a nice added feature. I highly recommend these wireless headphones to anyone.
R5NNSXDQ5392B,5,"I purchased a cheaper set of headphones and, you guessed it, they failed after about 5 or 6 months of use. I've  bought the Sennheiser headphones before and they are excellent. I liked them so much I bought another pair for my daughter. They have a good range and the sound quality is very good. I knew that if I spent a little more for a good set of headphones that I would get my money's worth and I did."
RIC37CENFBLVU,5,The Sennheiser RS120 is a quality product meeting my best expectations. Since it is wirelss there are a few times when small interferences creep in and out but once that is recognized I ignore it. The base sound is exceptional for a wireless headphone. I asked my wife to try but she wouldn't allow it. When good sound of music came on I asked her to just listen for a few moments. Yesterday I ordered two more. One for my wife and another for my son for Dad's day. Love em.
R1ISDQURYMD70T,5,"A year ago I purchased a 2.4GHz set from LTB and had the headset break just over a year into use.  In comparison, for half the price of what I paid back then, the Sennheisers blow the LTB's out of the water in terms of comfort, sound quality, and reception.  Little did I know it, but the LTB's were interfering with my wireless network, bluetooth devices, and did not work anytime someone was using the microwave.  Until more manufaturers go to the 5.8 GHz range and get the true digital surround products into a reasonable price range look no further than this product."
R34HXOC22DWME3,4,"works great i can listen to the tv while wy wife is sleeping, and while smoking out side"
RU6CML5P39OZB,4,"I purchased this item largely because one review claimed a range of 300 feet, although the \\""technical specifications\\"" listed say 120 feet.  I can tell you that the range is not 300' at my home, and it may not be the advertised 120'.  But, having said that, the performance and quality of the product is, otherwise, very good; and, I would purchase another set, assuming I don't find a product with a better range."
R31V28HLNEBFXZ,5,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones and have enjoyed having the ability to move some distance.
RJM8F151N75YQ,5,Given the information and pictures for this item it has surpassed my expectations. The only thing I didn't consider is cost of batteries (my concern they last a week or two with high usage). The quality is always good with this brand (my 2nd pair of Senn.) The sound quality is great and I cannot notice any feedback unless the volume is uh .0001 decimals. Sound is 100% clear 1-2 rooms away. In any confusion for PC hookup use the 2 prong adapter and Plug into the middle sound slot (Green for dell).Sometimes if the volume is to low or off for awhile it will disconnect giving you static. Overall A rating. As for tumor causing radio waves through my *&$#in brain I will keep you posted.
R1XPUE4ZHTQVRD,4,"Works Great! I can run Itunes on the computer, and go into the kitchen and have no problems at all.  The only thing that makes it a tiny bit annoying is that they can slip off my head fairly easily. Not to worry, if it's loud enough, you can still hear it if the headphones slip to your neck.  Definitely would buy again and recommend it to friends and family."
RSFG5G74FBN62,4,"I can concur with the majority of reviews which heavily influenced me in buying these phones. I had previously used wireless RCA and Sony. These R120's are easily the best I've owned and tremendous value, PROVIDING you don't move your head, as they too easily shift and fall off your bonce (London lingo for head...).I was aware this may be a problem, but having a head as big as mine, I thought that would not affect me, but it does! These phones are very comfortable and ideal for sitting or relaxing listening to your sound. But forget doing housework or washing up (the dishes to you yanks!!:).     They should have made these to at least have fitted your head so you can move around. So to summarise; if you want great sound, go for these great performing phones, if you want to move your head, forget it! I don't have the hiss problem by the way some people have complained of.     I'm still pleased I bought them, the performance is brilliant considering the price."
R3J3T8WZM19EOE,4,"Excellent product. This wireless headphone reproduces sound that is crystlely clear. With this headphone,I am able to enjoy surround sound. Easy to tune to the  emitted  signal. I used the headphone to listen to music and tv continueousely for seveal hours without charging the batteries at first and it is still working fine. once  in a while I do get a burst of static. I am glad I bought this headphone"
R38EQ59XZDXNQW,5,"Even tho these don't hv the ear 'spaces' I thought they did, they've been very comfortable on my big 'ol head (7 1/4 hat sz). By 'spaces', I mean the cutout space in the part that fits over your ear when the phones are on.  I don't ever hv to mess w/ the tuner, so it stays rt where it is.  The volume is very sensitive (a good thing).  It stays charged for a long time, they're easy to get situated on the charger, & they're very light,"
RZN134WKF2GJG,4,"I'm usually up before my husband and like to exercise first thing.  In order to watch tv while walking on the treadmill, I had to keep the volume too loud, so I purchased these headphones solely for that purpose.  I didn't want to spend a great deal of money, and for the price, these have worked out well.  A few minor problems, though.  The headpiece is large, doesn't fit very tight and isn't adjustable.  I tend to put a sweatband over them so they stay in place.  There is also a little interference regardless of how I tune them, but it's not enough to cause me any problems.  These have solved my problem and I'm very glad that I made the purchase."
R2ZBZG41F3M4DN,4,"This is a very good wireless headset.  I bought it to use with my iMac computer, and it does a very good job, supplying high-fidelity audio, much better than through the speakers.  The wearing comfort is pretty good; I didn't give it five stars partly because the on-the-ear design is a bit less comfortable than an over-the-ear setup.  The battery life is very long and the wireless range is phenomenal.      Also, there is one odd foible, applicable with computer audio that may have long silences: if there is silence (no signal) for three minutes, the base station turns off its carrier broadcast, which results in a blast of static in the headphones.  You have to make the computer beep to turn the carrier back on.  This is not a problem for listening to music or the typical video, but it is, say, for a NASA video stream, which may have minutes of silence.  Or just general computer operations with occasional audio.  A definite but minor annoyance.    I may buy another one for the TV/hi-fi so my daughter can watch movies without having to throttle the volume too severely.  Luckily, these operate on three different frequencies.  I'm also intrigued by the notion of getting an extra headset (HDR-120) so two people can use them at once from the same base station, to listen to the same thing.    Overall, I am very happy with these 'phones.  They are quite superior to the Sony IR wireless 'phones that they replaced.  And it's great to wander around the house without losing whatever I'm listening to from the computer!"
R1NRK0QGDDGKZY,4,"Overall, a very good product and I am satisfied.    First I ordered two headphones, as I was told that when plugged into the TV, the TVs sound was muted.  This is true with the small headphones plug, but when plugged into the audio output plugs, [I think they're called RCA plugs], the TV sound was independent of the headphones.  I could mute the TV speakers and still hear on the headphones.  Perfect for what I wanted.    The only negatives are:    The instructions are very basic, and not too helpful.  Its not too hard to figure out how to set them up tho.    Also, the volume and on/off switches could have been bigger and more user friendly.    Overall, I reccomend this product."
R1PATN4DRAWJPR,5,"I had some doubts about ordering these because I had never used wireless headphones before.  I was worried about sound quality, range, and hiss.  Having used them for about a month now, I couldn't be happier with them.  The sound is great, there is no hiss, and they never cut out.  The very first time I used them, I walked about 20 feet away and lost the signal.  My first thought was, \\""There it is...I was afraid of that\\"", but after adjusting the tuning dial, the signal came in incredibly strong and has stayed that way ever since.  I primarily use them late at night to watch movies when everyone else has gone to bed, but I have listened to music on them as well, and am just as pleased with that sound as with the movie audio."
R24JCLNK9TNZPL,5,"These headphones work as advertised -- excellent!  The range is  very good too.  Now I can do chores around the house and still hear my  favorite programs.  I would recommend them to anybody who likes to move around the house, or to those who might like to quietly listen to a show without disturbing others."
RZ7OUUQGYAXJX,5,"Unless you're looking for a pricey alternative, this product gives you an excellent feeling of being surrounded by sound without disturbing others. This is the second Sennheiser product I've purchased, and assuming it's as durable as the first (a 110 series), it's a good value.  In addition, the charging unit beats the Sony rendition hands down by easily docking unobtrusively."
R1Z1NS2B5FPV5F,5,"I use this to watch tv when my husband sleeps in our bedroom. The sound quality is great. I live on 3.29 acres and I can go to the back of my property and go into a metal barn and still hear the  tv. I wish the earphones were a little smaller and fit my head a little tighter, but this would definitedly not stop me from purchasing this or recccomending it to others."
R9UYGCNGKWBQ3,4,These head phones are better than a sony pair I had and much better that infra red earphones.  Range is at least 100 feet. would be aa five star if the earphone did not fall off easy if you bend over or look down at your feet.
R2WVM3SOT1RR68,5,They are the best ones we have purchased over  several years. The reception is clear and the  receiver distance ist good. The only thing that needs to be improved is the problem for the headphones to stay on your head  when you bend foreward. MT
RWUQH0N1HHZ0B,4,Have been very satisfied with cordless headphones.  I purchased them for my husband's birthday as he likes to watch TV in bed.  He has been very happy with them and finds he likes watching TV more with the headphones as he can hear sounds better.  I get more sleep. :-) Sometimes the signal drifts but it is easily adjusted and a minor inconvience.
RN1GBGE27HKN3,4,"I am thinking maybe I wasted my money on a surround system now that I have these wireless headphones. I take take of an elderly mother and my wife goes to bed early, now I can crank it up and watch my movies, listen to TV or music without disturbing them. Great sound, but you should stay in the same room because the reception is a little static out of the room."
R3JJJ3I51MYB0K,3,"I am glad I bought the refurbished one's and did not pay $100.00 for these.  The sound quality is good, but not great. They are uncomfortable and don't  fit well. They will fall off if you bend over. There is a hiss in the sound  if you fine tune  them for more volume. I do like the fact that the batteries are rechargeable. I do like the charging cradle. Like I said I am glad I only paid $36.00 for them. If I had paid $100.00 I would have been ripped off."
R2Q1ZFLFBJUIUZ,1,They don't work!!!!!!!!!! There is a tuning knob if you don't get it to the right spot you can't hear what you are tying to hear. Not good head phones at all don't recommend!!!!
R24DGKT5FZQLXZ,5,"i read all the reviews i could find online & they deserve all the 5 star ratings they were given. installation was easy , sound is great (everything i was looking for), & best of all the amazon price was about half what a lot of retailers were charging (& free shipping to boot).would recomend to anyone shopping for moderately priced wireless headphones."
R2XBT1AO0J5IZR,4,Good sound. Stylish. Could be more comfortable.  Earpads are completely flat and lie against your ear.  Should be hollowed out like other Sennheisers and lie around your ear.
RTNQDE7CKGE0K,5,"I've gone through several pair of Koss HB70 IR headphones, purposefully avoiding RF headphones. So this is my first pair of RF headphones.    The bad stuff:    - There are two knobs on the right speaker. One is volume, and the other is a tuner. You may hit the tuner a few times before adapting to the intended ergonomics. This is nothing less than a SCREWBALL design decision. The tuner knob should have been placed on the front or top, completely away from the volume knob. There is absolutely no excuse for this design (other than profit margin, I mean).    - There are three channels on the device. If everyone in your dorm has a pair, there is going to be massive overlap. The tuner has a \\""sweet spot\\"", where the audio is cleanest and loudest. Channel 2 seems to be the clearest in a low-interference area.    - The inductive charger puts out 100ma or less. The batteries will never fully charge unless you don't use the thing for an entire day. NiMH batteries do crystalize, they just do it much slower than nickel-cadmium. Plan on having a second set of batteries and a charger so you can fully run down the batteries once a month.    - The unit requires a certain amount of signal to keep the channel open. If there is a very quiet segment of a movie, or the top menu has no audio, the channel will drop and a full-volume blast of white-noise will emit from the speakers. It's a bit imprecise, too. Turn off your amp, and the green LED (indicating an open channel) may stay lit for 3 or 4 minutes. But 2 minutes of a DVD menu without audio, and the channel drops.    - If you lean forward, these are going to slide right off your head. They're little more than hanging. You'll have to rig something up if you're going to be moving around with these, or just remove them from your head.    - Is going to be subject to RF interference. In a high population density area (i.e. New York apartment), there's going to be all kinds of interference from modulators and mixers. If you live downtown, or in dorms, these may very well be unusable.      The good stuff:    - The SNR is significantly better than the Koss IR models. Background hiss is attenuated very well, but the audio has less dynamic range and clarity in comparison to corded headphones (naturally). Probably in the low 70dB range, but without the hiss. You have to crank the volume up to 90% of its maximum setting to hear the carrier hiss.     - The speakers are far behind the cushion, so sweat isn't likely to corrode anything.    - Batteries are very easy to swap out from the left speaker. The earpiece cushion just rotates 30 degrees, and you have unfettered access to the two AAA slots. Really excellent design. Well, you know, until the little plastic tabs break...    - Metal cradle holds the headset in just the right place for inductive charging. There's not going to be any long-term issues unless the metal brackets break from the housing.    - Ships with a switching power adapter instead of a linear tap.        Summary: Everything I needed, minus the RF induced brain cancer. A++, would buy again."
RZA54NQTZA7ZF,5,"I bought these earphones with hestitation.  However, after buying them, I couldn't be happier.  Batteries charge everytime you put them on their holder.  The sound is great, great great.  I can watch t.v. late at night and not bother other people in the household.  When I watch music programs, I use the earphones early in the evening because they really enhance the musical experience.  By the way, I have a huge head (7-1/2 hat size) and these headphones are EXTREMELY comfortable.  I honestly can't find one fault with these... and I bought them refurbished to boot.  I never leave reviews, but this time I felt obligated to let others know how pleased I am with these.  My son is buying a pair too!"
R13ZS8LSRSDEAA,3,The quality of sound and range are great. They cover my entire house even in the garage and both porches. The fit is though terrible they fall off my head at the slighteast movement. I made my hushand who is much large than I am try them on. He had the same problem and yes we did adjust them. I contacted the company. They said there is nothing that can be done and basically did not care. The reason I bought this product is to be able to move around the house and do my chores. Also so I can watch tv while working in the kitchen while my husband use the family room tv which is open to kitchen. Because of the fit you must sit in one place.
R1A0IVJ5GWJA1X,5,"These wireless radio frequency headphones provide quality audio output, are very comfortable to wear and work through walls.  Because many times there are multiple people in the room where TV is being watched but everyone may not want to hear the output of the TV, these headphones allow everyone to be happy.  Although they are a bit pricey they are worth the cost.  I have tried other headphones that work on infra red technology and these radio frequency headphones are superior to those in quality and distance. I can go to sleep while my husband watches his favorite western, avoiding the need to turn the volume down to a level where he cannot hear it but it still annoys me.  Easy hook-up on our plasma big screen TV."
RLM7NAF4LUY5U,5,"This headset had excellent quality of sound and the ability to adjust frequency to better clarify voices.  It was very comfortable to wear, with little pressure on your ears. A wonderfull headset."
R5E3RDZYJT1SN,5,"I bought the RS-120 headphones so my wife could watch TV late at night while I sleep.  While minimal installation instructions come with the unit, it was very easy to set up.  Took me about ten minutes to connect the base to my TV's audio out and install the batteries in the headset.  Range is pretty good.  I walked forty feet away from the TV and into my laundry room and didn't notice any difference in the sound.  My wife has watched TV for four hours after my bedtime without having to recharge.  Haven't attempted to test the max."
RJGF10EOH1ZH,5,I bought two pairs of these headphones.  My wife and I love them.  They work flawlessly with no problems as cited in other reviews.  They have truly changed our television viewing now that we can hear and understand the programs.  I replaced my TV EARS with the Sennheiser RS120 and find them much more comfortable.
R1RGGD5WUQ1BOO,1,"This unit will not function if set at a low volume. It has a \\""feature\\"" which shuts the unit off if it detects low/no sound. If you do not want others to hear what you are listening to then this unit is useless. If you want to share your tastes then why have headphones at all, just go naked ears and let everyone enjoy. A complete waste of money."
RHSB681R3MVZC,5,"These are perfect.  I use them in bed at night because my wife and I have different schedules.  They're hooked up to my Tivo.  The reception is flawless.  I haven't had any problems with humming or feedback, but I'm only 12-15 feet from the antenna.  Battery life is exceptional.  Charging dock is very convenient.  Way more than enough volume.  Great clarity.  The stereo works excellent.  You can definitely differentiate between left and right.  Good sound seperation.  Great product."
R2RAYD05GHHXFJ,5,"Really good headphones, excellent for the low price. Good fidelity, although perhaps not for maniac audiophiles. Occasional static, but good sound quality overall.    I live downtown in a mid-sized city, right in the middle of skyscrapers. Lots of steel and iron, lots of interference. I have a two-story loft with lots of metal in it (metal studs, steel girders, metal staircase, even metal wall coverings) and several wireless networks running 24/7. Three refrigerator motors, overhead fans, large electric heat fans. Well, you get the idea. Much electrical interference floating all around me.    But the wireless headphones work just fine all over the loft. Yup, even in the bathroom with the fan running. Even next to the computer.    For $65.00 you simply could not do better. I plugged it in, let the batteries charge for a day, and it worked right out of the box with minimal tuning.     Yes, they do slip off your head easily if you bend forward. They are not an Ipod or a Walkman. Best for sitting down and reading or watching TV. I use them mainly to watch TV when my wife has gone to sleep and they have been the perfect solution."
R2P8EO1GJWQRYR,4,"You hearing headphones are great except that there is no instructions as to use them along with the the sender that sends the sounds, there is three selections at the bottom of the sender. They work very well as I'm extremely hard of hearing."
R3IN1IBUIFATWE,4,"As others mentioned, there is always a static hiss which is noticeable when the volume is low. Also the blasting sound it makes when there is no music is kinda annoying. Overall its a good headphone for a reasonable price. The headphone is little bit bigger so it is not a \\""best fit\\"" for me."
RH7PCEQQI4QSE,5,I've tried others and none compare to this item. Easy to use and easy to charge. I recommend this set of ear phones to anyone
R1XP49YZM2BG6A,1,"Didn't work.  Battery charged, directions followed, and connections to a variety of sources all good - result: static.  Nothing but static.  Dunno.  Called manufacturer tech-support guy; he couldn't figure it out either, so approved a refund, which was promptly made upon item's return.  No complaints about the vendor, but I am loath to try another of this headphone.  If I could use negative stars, this'd rate a minus five."
RZVB5OUE8LQPG,5,The Sennheiser RS120 is a great product and does the job on wireless audio in fine style. I use it with my Sony Bravia TV set. After the required initial charge of 18 hours it has worked flawlessly.
RUIYHYQN0KHS3,4,"No question, wireless headphones are a great and useful idea.  Check-out the return policy of the shipper. I bought mine as  a gift, my wife wasn't fond of them but the 10 day period for  return had lapsed. Now I have to E-Bay them, service is not  what I would have expected on an unused product."
R3SMD31R9JGDIB,4,"Have had for six monthes - great purchase price, sound quality is very good - while watching TV I can hear other background sounds in the program viewing not normally noticed without the headphones.  Does not block out outside sound totally which can be good or bad.  Range is about half of what the rated distance states, but more than enough for my use. Phones tend to slid off of my head if I tip my head down at times. Other than these minor items I am very pleased with Sennheiser RS120 head phone set."
R30QKVLFG5SRMR,5,I got this for my husband and he loves it. It serves its purpose and didn't have any bothering background noises and now I don't have to complain about the TV being loud when I'm trying to sleep.
RED628ZYWOKLC,5,"I'm extremely pleased with this Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle. Sound quality is very good.Been using it with the computer listening to music and not having to disturb the whole household. Roam around the house, take a break and still be able to listen to the music(good range). Watch TV at night using it and everybody is happy. The headphone has its own volume control and the TV or computer do not have to be tuned up to work. No hissing or turning off like some of the other reviews said. Set it up according to the instructions and has been working perfectly."
R20C1REQJDLUQ0,1,when using the headphones the transmitter shuts off and a great hiss noise occurs which always startles me because it is very loud. I could not correct this problem with them.
R3GOO295RO1I51,5,"These are a great addition.  I wear them at night when my wife is sleeping and I want to watch TV.  They were easy to set up and since the TV has an 'external speaker' mode, they are easy to switch back and forth.  Good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Good vendor, too."
R6GVZ8HHNS8NA,4,Easy setup.  Works great.  Charging cradle forces headset to sit properly and charge everytime.  Headset very comfortable.
R6JOT4XVXN6FW,5,"Work doing digital transcription from home, this headset is used 7 days a week.  This is the best I have ever used, and I've tried many. Very comfortable, and seem to fit well.    Also downloaded an audio book, and was able to listen from everywhere in my home.  Highly recommed this to anyone."
RKBTAQ0OENF0W,5,"I just love the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones, I had a Sony Headphones before and the Sennheiser is a whole lot better than the Sony."
R36YAKW0C9MXGE,1,"I bought these headphones specifically to watch television with since I am much too far away from the television to be able to hear it without disturbing others. Sitting directly beside me as I watch television is always my laptop which I use for various things included running a business. I am connected to the internet at all times and I like to multi-task and watch television while I am using the internet. For some reason my internet kept running extremely slow all the time and for the life of me, I just thought it was the darn cable company. Finally i came to find out that my internet was working fine when I wasn't watching television, but as soon as I turned on these headphones, away it went. These things are useless if it going to ruin my wireless internet connection. Hopefully I will find a less intrusive pair soon."
R3PVC0IQQ0S6X4,4,"I am not an audiophile. I bought these head phone because in order to hear the TV I have to turn it up so loud it drives everyone else out of the room. I have tried TV ears and several other headphones and found them lacking for one reason or another. I love these headpones. The sound quality is excellent, maybe not compared to a set of high end head phones, but certainly compared to that of the TV alone. They are comfortable to wear and I can go anywhere in the house and still hear clearly in stereo. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the loose fit, which makes them comfy if you sit still, but easy to fall off if you get up and move around. Now my wife wants a pair."
R1PWJQJDQBAUKI,5,"My wireless Sennheiser headphones have served me very well. The sound is reasonable in any room or outside even beyond their stated range. Would definitely recommend for the  price. However, the ear covers could use some reengineering to provide more of a cupped and secure fit."
R3J4Y86AJAHXP2,4,"These headphones are comfortable and have good sound quality. The base unit is a good design, charges the phones without fuss about how they are positioned, unlike some I have owned that were very difficult to achieve a good contact with the electrical surfaces. Good value. Recommended."
RE8XX0S53O6Q8,1,"These are just aweful.  After about 4 mos, they won't hold onto your head. If you look down while wearing them, they will hit the floor. Also, if your audio signal goes quiet for more than about 30 seconds, you hear a little \\""click\\"" then deafening static hiss.  Was very dissapointed."
R16V1DH50R896K,1,"I want wireless headphones because I prefer not having the cord dangling from my head at work. I took these out of the box, and was amazed at how bulky they are. I put them on my head, and felt these warm fuzzy cups engulf my ears. That was enough. I knew I could not wear these at work to listen to my Sensa portable music player - they make my ears too hot."
R23EVX0WI5JJNH,1,"Product is physically made well, however I pick up all sorts of interference, most of the time I just get static."
RJBZ3FYCZJDQF,2,"There are too many positive reviews to say they never work.  However, the one I recieved would never transmit and was returned."
RB57V85LK68LL,5,"It is certainly possible to get poor performance out of these.     You can use them with the batteries half charged, when you will get either low volume and hiss or loud volume in one speaker and low volume out of the other.    You can also tune them slightly off channel or fail to select a clear/free channel on the base. Again you will get hiss and some crackling and popping noises as you move around.    You can also combine some of the above and go behind a building or two and walk around a lot.    You can also put in a weak audio signal to the base, which gives similar results.     I have done all of the above and got back poor performance.     And its easily done, I nearly took them back. Such is the current nature of wireless devices, including headphones. Sadly the human ear does not and these (analogue) headphones cannot realistically correct for interruption of transmission as some digital devices can.    But used correctly these headphones give excellent results for wireless headphones. Clear crisp signals and, in my case, I can happily walk anywhere in my house without significant interference. However as per the other reviews, if you want absolutely perfect uninterrupted sound either do not leave the room the amp is in or buy a set of corded phones - in which case you cannot leave the room the amp is in anyway.    I have also had a pair of logitec wireless headphones valued, at the time, at a similar price. The Sennheisers beat the logitec headphones hands down, absolutely no contest. The logitec (bluetooth) phones had a nasty compressed, closed in and restricted sound. A sound that you only fully notice after a while of listening. But enough for me to want to take them off after half an hour or less.     In contrast the Sennheisers can be worn for long periods giving comfortable, crisp and clear sound and I tend to forget Im wearing and listening to them rather than wanting to take them off.    Some reviewers rightly question why all the 5 star reviews.And I hesitated to give 5 stars. Why ? Well because if I compare these with a set of Sennheiser 555s, for example, well the sound from the latter is superior. Its as simple as that. Fuller. Clearer. Crisper. More defined. Dollar for sound quality, the 555s are better at achieving a great sound.     But if I compare these with other wireless headphones currently available these headphones are simply excellent. In fact I have not found any viable contenders with which to compare. Plus if I compare these to a set of Sennheisers in a similar to slightly lower price range, they sound just as good if not better - the difference is small and so highly subective. So if these 120s were not available I would not be buying wireless headphones at all - it wouldnt be worth it.    So when I give 5 stars I am bearing in mind that these headphones actually work very well as a wireless headset. They also have excellent sound for your average to moderately discerning listener. You can only currently improve on one of these attributes - ie the sound may be improved by getting a set of expensive corded headphones. Certainly the 555s, and possibly some cheaper Sennheisers.     But also be careful, these headphones do sound very good in their own right so you will not get better sound from a significantly cheaper headset and I dare guess not from another cheaper brand (But I confess I havent tried since I regard Sennheiser as the leader here). However dollar for sound you may get better value without the wireless feature, but to fail to do so would be to expect the wireless for free would it not ?    So take into account I wanted a pair of wireless headphones that actually work as a wireless audio device, are comfortable to wear and sound at least as good as my last Sennheisers and preferably as good as other Sennheisers in a similar to lower price range. I believe I have achieved all of these, and that's why I give 5 stars. And that's the context they should be taken in."
R1RUVBKUN68IVN,5,Made the mistake of not reading the instructions carefully which caused me to waste quite a bit of time. Recommendation - read instructions carefully.  The sound quality is very good. As previous folks have mentioned - to reduce the static/hiss - you need to increase the input power to the phones and then reduce the volume using the control on the headphones.  Phones are comfortable and easy to use once setup correctly.   I bought an extra set of phones and they both work well of the same RF transmitter.  Wish I had bought these a long time ago. TV noise is now not a problem.  I plan to also buy another RF transmitter plus headphones to run on my computer.
R1ZE5E4U588RFG,4,"I purchased these after I returned a set of Infared headphones to watch TV while on a treadmill. These headphones work great with no interference from the Treadmill motor. Nice feature to have the rechargeable batteries built in and very easy to place on the stand to recharge. As others note, the headphones can slip off your head if you move around."
R3IPVO0V4Z7VGB,2,"I don't understand all the 5-star reviews here. These headphones have a lot of problems.  First off, there is a problem with connectivity to the audio jack. every 20-40 minutes (Haven't noticed a pattern yet) I lose signal and have to pull out audio cable out of the PC audio jack and put it back in to restore the signal. I know it's not a problem with my audio port because I have wired earbuds and have no such issues.  Then, you have the headphones that are so heavy that if I tilt my head down they slip off my head and fall.  Then, the signal quality is certainly just sub-prime. For some reason I can never get the two headphones to work at the same time so I get to hear the sound in my right ear only.  Overall, these headphones are a disappointment. Do not buy!"
R17IYDWJ9FAUB5,5,"Love'em! Love'em! Love'em!    For the money you can't beat these. They are really fantastic! I am so happy with them. And the distance I am able to walk away from the transmitter is as much or more than they say. I have them on right now. Just beautiful.    And for anyone who may be having trouble with the headphones being a little to loose, try extending them all the way out.    It seems the makers of these headphones have them so the tighter you want them is the opposite position of what most of us are use to. I found this out quite by accident.     Maybe what I just said is in the literature that comes with the it, but I didn't see it.    Do yourself a big favor: get these. You will not be sorry.    Cheers!"
R3VZ270L2W66BK,4,"Very comfortable to wear.  Nice, clear sound with no distortion.  Could use a little more base, but otherwise very nice set of wireless head phones.  Impressed with the quality."
RLLPE9CU4LUP5,5,"This unit hands down one of the best values in wireless headphones. It features high quality clear sound, easy intallation, rechargeable batteries and a great price... I highly recommend this product for  people with sleeping babies for watching TV..."
R31DW2QTUSFPCE,3,"The sound quality is mediocre.    The headset is comfortable, but if you don't have a large head I wouldn't buy them.  Any time I reach down to grab something the headphones slide off."
R34ZQFN81UWIB7,4,The best thing about this headphone is that it charges so easily by just putting it on the stand.  I do not like the fact that the volume rock is next to the tuner.  I've hit tuner couple of times when I meant to adjust the volume and I am not getting used to it.  Sound quality is good but the soft sponge cover doesn't quite feel that good.  It also feels flimsy and it probably will fall apart in a year or two.  I also don't like the hiss when there is no sound coming out of it.  I realize I said a lot of bad thing about this product but it's good enough that I would buy it again.  What I wrote here are all criticism that i can make about this product.  The price is very good.      P.S.  Stupid USPS lost the package.  I emailed Amazon about it and Amazon just sent a new one right away.  Amazon got back to me in 1 hour on Saturday.  How awesome is that?  I would shop at Amazon for anything.
R2WAWML231SIRG,5,I have a hearing problem and if I don't use these my wife will have the hearing problem also.  I have to turn the television up so load to hear it that no one else in the same room can stand it.  When I put these on I can listen as load as I want without bothering the rest of my family.  They are very clear anywhere in the house.
R3CG63ZJTVVS98,5,"Love these new wireless headphones...amazing value.  In a nutshell:    Pros:  -Great sound (much better than the factory speakers on my high-end HDTV), very crisp and clear.  -Amazing ease-of-use.  I debated between purchasing this set of RS 120's, and the lower-priced version, the RS 110's.  Apparently the main difference is that the 120's recharge automatically when you hang them on the cradle, but with the 110's, you have to manually remove the batteries and recharge them on your own each time they run down.  The ability to simply hang up these headphones on their cradle and have them charge on their own is *definitely* worth the extra ~$20 or so, in my opinion.  Because of the design (two open spots in the cushioned headset with metal contacts that allow recharge as soon as they're hung up on the cradle), you don't even have to plug them in to recharge.  So simple!  -Very functional.  When watching live tv, I can get up and go into other rooms during commercials and hear when the show is back on.  Useful for multi-tasking :)    Cons  -I've noticed that if I leave the headphones on but have the tv/dvr (etc) paused for more than a couple of minutes, it will start transmitting static noise.  Easily fixable, just turn down the volume, but definitely a big surprise the first time it happened.    Overall, I would highly recommend these...in fact, my roommate loves them so much, she is purchasing a pair for her boyfriend!"
R3R5UME4SO2U57,5,"The Sennheiser RS120 is a very good wireless headset.  As I read the reviews, I was thinking I would get a 'so-so' product.  But, I experieced none of the issues that some other people reported.  I found the tuning to right on for stereo from my LCD TV.  The bass and stereo separation was very good for a wireless headset.  I had no difficulty separating the volume and tuning controls, even though they are both located behind the right ear.  I experienced no interference when I walked away from the sound source and was able to move about my home with no difficulties hearing the audio.  They are a little uncomfortable when lying in bed listening to the TV; but can be overcome easily.  I recommend the Sennheiser RS120 to anyone looking for a middle of the road (not too expensive and not too cheap) wireless headset with very good audio."
R2B14NJ09X9L21,5,"I've had this unit now for couple months and love them. Sound quality is excellent, they are easy to use and comfortable to wear. I don't think you can find better headphones for the moderate price."
R2E6TSRQGFLLOE,5,You always wonder if what you are going to buy meets the expectations.  This product does!  We were all amazed on how clear the sound is and the range of the headset.  We liked them so much we ordered another set.
R1OPYO6R7ZCCQQ,5,"Perfect performance, clear no distortion. Gives more of a stereo feel to sound when wearing. I can wear them all the way dowstairs in my house and out on back deck with no distortion at all. I would recommend to all my friends. My wife can watch TV in bedroom now without keeping me awake."
RGQTAWBFGQE5E,5,Great gift for anyone. Mom is 78 and a little hard of hearing. She said watching TV is a whole new experience. If she was watching the news and just needed to listen while she went to the kitchen or another part of the house she said this is GREAT!! I was pleased that the headphones came with every thing that I needed to get Mom hooked up. I think I'll put in a request for my birthday. The shipping was also very fast. Great product for the price.
R3NFEDFBTHPRN4,5,"Easy to set up, just plug it in and it works immediatly. I can walk 3 or 4 rooms away and the headphones don't lose the signal at all."
R3NJY6YUWUY7BO,4,have enjoyed the product every omce in a while they do not connect and have to rec harge  but as a whole am satisfied very comfortable
R27YQTQCQ18EEY,3,"Pro's  1. Good sound quality: solid base, clean treble and midrange.    2. Easy to connect and set up.  3. Slick recharging when you place headphones on the base unit.  4. Easy to replace AAA NiMH batteries    Con's  1. These are an \\""open-air\\"" design.  For me this was a disadvantage and defeated the point of my purchase...to listen to TV in bed without disturbing others.  These do not isolate one from external noises, unless the volume is turned up to an uncomfortable level.  This also means that one's spouse can hear the TV and/or music while listening, since the sound is quite audible to others in a quiet setting, eg, bedroom.  2. Fit - I found the headset to be too loosely fitting on my ears.  My motorcycle helmet is a size Large, so it's not that I have a small head.  They will fall off quite easily when moving one's head.  3. Noise - There is a distinct whistle/noise that becomes more noticeable as one gets further from the base transmitter.    I own other Sennheiser headphones, including noise-canceling ones that I use extensively. These did not disappoint in sound quality, but were not fit for my purpose and frankly were too loose fitting.  Ultimately I arranged to return them to Amazon and am considering either the RS140's or Sony BlueTooth headphones."
R1V5JRGSKCGDTZ,4,"Don't let the title fool you. I love these things. Unlike some of the other comments, I have had nothing but crystal clear sound from the moment I turned them on. I have even gone outside with them a short distance from the house and the sound is still clear and that with the base unit stored in the cabinet underneath the TV. I seldom get any interference. I will say that currently I only use the phones to listen to the TV. I haven't tried to use them in an audio, PC, or gaming application. At this point in time, I have the base connected to the audio output connectors on the TV.    There are only 2 issues I have. The more annoying one is the fit. With the Sennheiser name, I thought the fit would be better. They \\""toe in\\"" toward the front of my head creating pressure points just in front of my ears. After wearing them for a short while, this becomes less noticible but it is still there. The second is a burst of static when I pause the Tivo receiver I have for a few moments. I normally get around this by just turning the headphones off when I'm not actually listening to something (I do the same when a commercial comes on and I'm watching Live TV). The on/off switch is getting a workout and we'll have to see how it holds up after a period of time. Of course, taking them off works pretty well too.    Pros:  . Clear sound/great reception  . Good range  . rechargable batteries  . quiet house for the rest of the family  . better acoustics for the listener  . PRICE (this is an exceptional price for this unit)    Cons:  . Uncomfortable fit (at least for my head)  . Annoying static during pauses"
R36TIHZSC163L2,5,I don't have to have the TV blaring when I'm on the treadmill! Reception is perfect- NO static at all.  Amazon's price was at least $30 cheaper than either Target or Best Buy!  I definitely recommend this.
R1SC5Z6J9E9OYG,1,"I got this product on April 1 and when I tried it I felt like it was a brank on April fools  after I saw the 5 stars reviews, I thoght this product doesn't even need a test drive to know how good it is.  People, don't give the 5 stars review any regard, the sound quality is horrible, the hiss and the whistling and the noise these headphones make is so off putting it will make you hate the show you're watching or the game you're playing or even your favorite song.  I really just can't comprehend all the 5 stars reviews.  Trust me people, you wanna try it at a store first before buying it on the internet, just to save you the return shipment cost."
R17BJDI53C9E9O,1,Auto-shutoff is probably the worst feature I've ever seen. The blast of loud sound happens after pausing my audio output for a few minutes! I've thrown my head phones off more than once after the punishing blast of sound.
R3KD78S9QLLXY9,3,"When they work they are great. I have had the same problem as other purchasers where the on/off light will just not come on and you lose the signal.  I nearly packed the headphones up to return them and gave them ONE LAST TRY lol and after unplugging EVERYTHING connected to the headphones (including taking out the batteries) the unit finally came back on and they worked great again.  I can have the TV on soft mute so husband doesn't have to listen to my programs and can adjust the volume fine to my own comfort.  My hearing is less than husbands so he can have TV at a volume that is comfortable to him and I can wear headphones and turn the volume up.  If I keep having the same trouble I will return them. So my final thoughts are, if I had read the negative reviews first I probably wouldn't have purchased these."
R1976I3CT3YQI0,2,"Foreword: I use these for my home computer. I'm 23 and a very experienced computer user.    There are a few things about these headphones that make them seem as if they were designed by someone who had never been told what they'd be used for.    Let's start off with the fact that they're wireless headphones, but the charging base has two frustratingly short wires you need to accommodate. There's the obvious input jack that pulls the sound from the computer. It's so short (4 or 5 feet maybe?) that it becomes a real pain to position in a convenient/attractive way in the room. It creates one of those taut, easy to accidentally snag hanging wire situations that has ended in my charging base startlingly slamming to the floor on a few occasions. The charging base needs to be plugged into a wall jack with an equally short cord, however, this one ends in an inexplicably large AC adapter that will require you to shuffle (if not completely unplug) some of your other gadget AC inputs.    Yes, you've heard me right. Amount of wires to deal with on a regular, 2 dollar set of headphones from a 7-11: 1 wire. Amount of wires to deal with on a pair of 70 dollar Sennheisers: 2 wires, both of which are too short and clunky. Am I missing something here?    Perhaps even worse is the auto-off feature of the headphones. If the headphones receive no audio information for about five minutes (i.e. the CD you were listening to ended, the movie you were watching is over and you've fallen asleep in bed), the headphones will shut off to preserve battery life. But rather than just going quiet, you get an earful of unending, louder than holy hell static. So every time your PC goes quiet for more than five minutes and you have those headphones on, get ready to crap yourself when they kick in with horror-movie-level, ear-splitting static.    I know these have gotten great reviews, but most of those come from people who have owned the product for about a week. Over prolonged use, you learn to HATE these things. Do yourself a favor and buy a cheapo, 1-wire, no static pair from anywhere else."
R1I1TAE8TP13UA,3,"It's okay for the lower end model, experienced some crackles and hisses of extra noise. Perhaps its cause of where I'm living, in Manhattan. But I needed something better so I kept this and bought the add on headset RS140 and that was much improved."
RCUPGZ7UI43HJ,4,"I purchased this headset because I was familiar with the quality of Sennheiser products. The price was the deciding factor and was aided by good customer reviews.  I found the unit was easy to set up but I did spend a couple of minutes getting the unit to communicate with the base station. The sound quality is quite good but as previous comments have noted use the volume control on the TV to adjust the volume to prevent the background hiss from becoming noticeable. The device is quite comfortable to wear but my ears become a warm after extended wear, noticeable but not uncomfortable.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is rather bulky.   Overall, this is a great wireless headset that can't be beat on price and quality."
R2SYRYRBCAUCSC,4,"this is a big improvement over using headphones with wires. We use it every day and it is mobile, lightweight and clear, has a tuner and volume on the headset."
R2JH2FG2D09NFR,3,"Sounds great, as long as I don't move my head. What's the secret to keeping it on your head. I feel I have a normal type head with medium length hair. Every time I look down or move my head, the headphones fall off. Does anyone have a solution?"
R3INQUZ2NY1P1Y,5,Very well satisfied with the headphones which are useful now that my hearing has diminished.  TV doesn't need to be up so high it blasts others out of the living room.  Quality workmanship on these headphones. Best ever.  W. Jahn
R2S4NYICLW2T7Q,3,"I didn't search very long through the products, and picked these headphones very quickly. I am an architecture student and I wanted headphones that I could walk around the room in and still be able to hear my computer without disturbing the other students.   I love having the headphones, but there is a very annoying ticking sound that happens sometimes when the volume of whatever I'm listening to goes down. Sometimes when I adjust the knob it goes away, but almost always comes back within a short amount of time. I'm keeping them because I don't know if this is a regular thing for wireless headphones and I don't have any other complaint.   They are a bit cheaper than some of the other choices, and having the charging cradle is very convenient."
R22EF5IT7L7QW6,5,"The product is well packaged, looks very professional, and the charging system is unique and has worked well.<br /><br />The set was connected to a Sony 50&quot; rear-projection set in a location with no heavy wiring or metal objects, cement walls or ceiling and I'm not happy with the reception since the sound can be distorted with some static or hum depending on whether I'm watching a VCR tape or TV program 10-15' away. The headphone acoustics isn't all that good in my opinion. I'm really dissatisfied that one spot right in the middle of my lazy-boy that causes the sound to become distorted,  with a lot of white noise -- just a tilt or movement of the head either left or right. The height of the transmitter or moving it away from the TV location does not make any difference as does resetting to one of the other two channels on the transmitter.<br /><br />An apparent problem is when the input signal to its transmitter is too low, you mute the TV, pause the VCR, or a scenes is being shown that has a long silence, the base unit will shut down and a very loud static will blast your eardrums and that really hurts. This could be a big drawback if it depend on the TV volume alone since the purpose of using them in the first place is to turn the volume down. It does shut down on occasion for no apparent reason.<br /><br />On occasions, as with many wireless products, there is occasional<br />interference and I have received the next door neighbor talking on their phone which is a cordless but I don't know their frequency. Our 800mh phone does not interfere and there is no other wireless items round except garage door opener devices.<br /><br />The headset fits pretty well and is comfortable for extended wear but is slightly larger than I like for my head size 7. It certainly tends to slip around to much or fall off when nodding your head. They could have improve the ear pieces by cupping them so they fit around the ears instead of the fitted flat covers used.<br /><br />Too much interference for a $70 device in my opinion.<br /><br />Update 10/18/09: Had to use the manufacturer warranty on 9/21/09 since the charging system failed. Just received today a confirmation that the unit is being replaced and that Seenheiser is mailing a new replacement.<br /><br />First edit: Everything above still stands after receiving my replacement. But, the reception and sound tracking is really, really better than the first set. I took the covers and foam rubber off the ear pieces and cut out a circle from the foam rubber so that the phone pieces more or less fit around the ears. After replacing the covers and the foam rubber circles the headset fits a lot better and doesn't fall off to often. Now why couldn't they think of that.<br /><br />Update 5/30/12: The two paragraphs above with stood the time until today when the receiver base GREEN light no longer lights when attached to its source nor is there any sound in the headphones other than white noise. Checking every single thing to see if there was a connection problem of some sort I found nothing had changed and unplugging and re-plugging didn't help. Still no reception so guess the RS120 is shot. Lasted just over three years before failing with absolutely no abuse.<br /><br />Update 9/16/2016: Much has changed apparently with the RS120 headphones and now becomes a 5-STAR. I order a new set June 2, 2015 and could not be more satisfied with the settings and reception. I wanted the RS120 so I could exchange the ear piece cutouts from the previous and put them on the newer. For the past year and half, I've not experienced ANY PROBLEM with the current set other than using them until the battery required recharging. I've had no problem whatsoever with static, cutouts or dropping of sound of one ear piece or the other. I certainly hope all customers buying the RS120 are as fortunate as I. I do highly recommend this unit today."
R201L7UNSQCFI7,3,"Advantages:  - Simple and clear design, simple tuning, sound amazing and smooth.  - Supported range - impressive indeed.  Disadvantages:  - There is no universal charger, which is outrages nowadays. This is so obvious default for all home electronic and gadgets, that I was deeply disappointed.   - Both, the volume and tuning scrolling buttons are very small and reside on the same side of the headphone, one under another. Any try of volume adjustment requires full person attention and coordination.  - When TV is turned off, the switched-on headphones may generate heavy radio noise. Switch OFF/ON may fix the problem. Or may not..."
R29YQWXTWNVCWQ,4,"I'd buy it again without hesitation, fantastic improvement in Tv and Movie watching, no need for sub-titles anymore"
R126WYBCNK9BJI,5,"I think I was referring to the wrong product when I replied to a recent order, I was referring to the ear phones instead of the ink cartridge.  Both are very satisfactory."
R194ZQYQ9425JT,5,Well I read some of the reviews and purchaced the Sennheiser RS 120 .  They came on Friday and I unpacked them and the set up  was straight forward. Its pretty hard to make a mistake. Just make sure you put the batteries in correctly. I hooked it up to my Direct TV to the sound out I turned it on and it worked great. I walked around my property and range was great.  The directions said to charge the batteries for eighteen hours so put it on the charger and did just that. The next day was the Sebring 12 hour race and I am hard of hearing so put them on at 7am and listened till 9:00am took a two hour break and the race came back on at 11:00sm so they were on form 11:00am till 7:45pm and the batteries were still working fine. So they lasted in excess of my expectations. Ten and a half hours and still going strong. When I turned the unit on in the morning I had some of the hiss that I read about so I changed channels and the third channel was nice and clear  problem solved. Also After wearing them all day my ears did not hurt and that was a surprise. They do not fit me real tight but tight enough. They are made nice. I am a happy customer.  One thing that seemed confusing to me is it dosent tell you witch way to set them on the charger. so I put them on so you can read the name Sennheiser on the top form the front.  Seems to charge fine that way. Im very pleased
R3QEOC3L448OOM,5,Found the Headphones to be excellent. Sound quality is outstanding. Range of reception is well beyond what I needed. Could wear them upstairs.
R2VLSMESIGEE0I,4,"I'm pleased w/ this purchase.  Headphones are durable and sound quality is excellent; no static.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it picks up my cel phone conversation.  So, whenever my husband has the headphones on, he can hear my entire conversation. I'm not sure if it's because of my frequency of my particular phone.  The convenience of not changing the battery every week and a half is a plus.  I bought a Kensington Headphones from Walmart prior to the Sennheiser and it broke within 3 weeks.  So, spend the extra $50 to get the Sennheiser.  It's worth the money and the hassle of changing batteries.  Aloha!"
RKZVZWEYYVPYA,5,This is a nice piece of equipment for the money it is sold for. Very easy to set up and has great quality and range. The hiss most people complain about is barely audible and the headphone themselves are very comfortable over the ears.
R1N85KWEG646ZZ,5,"After researching all brands of wireless headphones I decided on the Sennheiser RS-120's. What a great investment for $69.95 plus shipping! I also ordered the extra pair, an \\""Additional Headphone for RS120 Wireless Headphone System\\"" at; $39.03 plus shipping. I ordered both through Amazon.com.   The clarity is great in every room! I bought this pair for my dad who is in his 80's and with hearing loss. With the volume of the television turned down to a tolerable level I'll be able to visit and watch the Boston Red Sox, movies and other broadcasts this year without the headache of volume hangover the next morning!!! I tried them on myself while setting them up (which was very easy), and found them to be comfortable and very nice sounding. The Sennheiser RS120 has a nice rich stereo sound and I found no problem with walking around his home with them on. They stay on nicely w/out being too tight and w/out the pressure on the ears or head. The light on the transmitter is a good reminder to shut them off after use, and the charger light shows that the batteries are charging. If you're serious about finding a great wireless headphone set then I promise that your search is over!!!  Thank-you Sennheiser~"
R2ZK96KIQZPY9B,3,"I liked this product as a whole, but the static was a little annoying, I was hoping for a little something better for this price. But I'd still probably buy it again."
R1OHH4DMH04TIE,3,Wireless headphones are a great way to avoid disturbing a sleeping partner while watching TV. I connected my headphones to the audio output of my DISH receiver with no problems.  Generally the sound is great but there are a few glitches.  When I leave the room I often get some ear popping static which is unpleasant.  I've also noticed that occasionally the base seems to interfere with my DISH reception.  If I wiggle the wires I can usually fix the problem.  Maybe the problem is with my DISH receiver but I expected the headphones to work better.
R2FFQIIAMJWGQ4,4,"The Sennheiser RS120 headphones are great.  I'm a bit hard of hearing, so I turn the TV up too loud.  The volume level bothers my wife, who has good hearing.  Now she can listen to the TV (through the stereo speakers) at a comfortable volume, while I adjust the volume through the headphones for my listening needs.    Because the sound from the headphones is so clear, plus they cut out much of the ambient noise, I can now listen to the TV at a much lower volume and still understand every word.    The only problem with the headphones is when the input volume to its transmitter is low, the base unit will shut down and very loud static comes through the headphones.  This will jolt you right out of your chair.  I read about this problem in other reviews.    How I solved the problem was to buy a headphone amplifier and place it between the 'Line Out' of my stereo, and the headphone transmitter.  My wife can now lower the output volume from the stereo so low that you can hardly hear it, and the headphone transmitter never shuts down.    Life is now good."
R1F4DZ43TG3LMX,4,"These are very, very good wireless headphones. I have a couple of quibbles about them, but overall, these are well worth the money, and if you're looking for quality sound and some freedom in your movement, I highly recommend you invest in these headphones.      PROS:    Excellent Audio Quality -- as good or better than many other sets I've used. Maybe not as good as studio monitor headphones, but that's expected for a $70, wireless set. The frequency range is wide and clear, and it's great for virtualized surround sound. I've enjoyed movies, games, and extensive audio editing with these headphones. I listen especially to a lot of classical music, and brass sections are especially clear and crisp. There's also plenty of bass in there for celli and bassi, and the occasional bombshell exploding in Call of Duty.    Long-Range Wireless -- I was able to walk from the base connected to my PC, in the back bedroom of my house, out the front door, across the street to my neighbor's driveway, in 40MPH wind, with barely-perceptible interference (a small hiss, but not enough to really detract from the sound). Once I got back to my driveway, the sound was as clear as it had been in my back bedroom.    Form -- These headphones fit my head well, and they are curved in such a way that I think all but the smallest heads would be very comfortable wearing these phones for extended periods. Also, the phones themselves are covered in a durable windscreen-type material, in such a way that they encompass your ears enough to hear everything clearly, but they don't surround your ears, so you can still hear when someone nearby asks you a question. Also, these covers come off by turning them at an angle, allowing you to clean them or replace the batteries set in behind them.    Charging -- The recharging system is brilliant. Two metal places are exposed in the top of the headphones, set into the foam that touches the top of your head. You simply set the set on top of the metal rack built intothe base, and it charges! I've used them several times for 3 to 5 hours at a time, and I haven't had the batteries run out. I simply place the headphones back on the cradle when I'm not using them, and they charge right back up.    Controls -- The on/off is on the left ear, the volume and tone controls are on the right. Unlike some, I did not find the right-ear controls inconvenient. As long as you remember that the volume is the bigger, top knob, you won't have any problems.      CONS: (My comments regarding cons are much longer than the actual impact of said cons. These are relatively minor issues with a very good product.)    Interference -- As with all wireless products, there is at least occasional interference. On rare occasions, I will be using these with my PC and will tilt my head a certain way, and some uncomfortable interference will come across the phones. However, I have the base set behind my 22\\"" monitor, leaving a very narrow vertical gap for the base to transmit.    Automatic Shutoff -- When working on my PC, I will sometimes put the headphones around my neck after working on audio editing, and go to my e-mail or something else without sound. Typically, the headphones shut off after about 3-5 minutes, leaving a static hiss. It can be jarring if you still have the headphones on. I try to remember now to flip the switch off when I have no audio playing, so that it doesn't happen. Also, it usually takes about 3 seconds once the audio signal is back for the headphones to start receiving it again. It's beneficial to the batteries, and not a problem, as long as you remember that the energy-saving is perhaps a little too efficient.    Charging -- The little red charging light on the base stays on at all times when the headphones are resting on the stand. This leaves you not knowing whether or not they are actually charging or not. I don't mind this, but sometimes the headphones will actually ride up a bit when the phones are extended, to where the terminals don't actually touch. Since the headphones aren't quite touching the stand at this point, the little red light goes off. So then I just push on the top of the headset, and the little red light turns back on. I am still surprised this happens, because the headphones are very sturdy, and I would think the weight would be enough for them to stay firmly on the stand. However, this only happens sometimes when the phones are extended.    Packaging -- While everything is very well packaged, it took me a couple of minutes to find everything. The AC adapter and the RCA Y-adapter were kind of hidden in the packaging. Once you find them, though, everything's fine. But it does make me wonder if some people had the same problem and accidentally threw away the RCA Y-splitter that came with the set... It seems several other reviewers were missing one.      Final Word:    Overall, this is a very good product, and I can highly recommend purchasing it. It's well-priced, and the cons are really minimal, as long as you are aware of them. I am glad I bought this set."
R3P9NBTK87ZEFR,1,this head piece is way too large for a normal head and there is no way to make it smaller so that when you go to move it falls off your head if I hadn't destroyed the carton I certainly would have return it. I will say that the audio is very good.
R39OBAXYRCW94Z,5,We are very satisfied with the Sennheiser wireless head phones.  They're great for listening to shows that have too much background music for the dialogue to come through clearly (especially to older listeners).  We realized they also offer the option of moving around the room and even the whole house without missing parts of the program.  My husband can also listen to his favorite CD's from his workshop.
R1DON44VL6BXHG,4,"I got this headphone so I could watch TV without disturbing my daughter in the next bedroom: it seems my hearing has deteriorated somewhat that I always have to turn the volume higher.  The alternative would be to watch in MUTE mode and read the caption, which I do not do very well.  My husband travels internationally and when he can't sleep due to jet lag, he tends to sit up and watch TV which makes me lose sleep in turn.  This wireless headphone solves both problems and does it wonderfully.  I have not been able to hear the TV dialogue so clearly for a long time.  It does have 2 minor problems: one is after about 30 minutes of wearing the headphone it feels like it is clinching to my head.  The other is my DirecTV remote behaves less responsive now due to signal interference.  But both problems are bearable.  I am glad I got this headphone."
R15YEQSYOUSHQS,4,"Just bought in February 2009.  Free shipping was faster than quoted.  Product in new condition. Works great but it is not the most comfortable headset. Since it's a radio-frequency signal, I got reception of the t.v. sound all over my multistory house.  Although with a baby monitor nearby there was some intereference. So just keep them at least 10-feet apart. Two indicator lights: 1. green = sound coming through. 2. red = charging.  It will automatically turn off if no sound is detected, will quickly turn on once audio signal (sound) present.<br /><br />It'll slip off your ears real easy. Lying down on your side so your head rests on the earphone is not recommended.  This headset is best at resting on the top of your head instead of cupping your ears.  I suppose one could add extra padding or something to give it that pleasant cupped feel.<br /><br /> Initial charging on the cradle took about 24hours as the booklet says.  Mounted cradle/transmitter on a shelf above the t.v.  A mini-headphone style plug connects to the unit and the other end is an RCA L/R jack to the Audio out of the t.v.  A power adapter cord also plugs into the bottom of the unit.  Plugging into the Sennheiser unit is difficult due to the cramped design.  Use needle nose pliers if necesssary. Seems easy to break something if not careful.<br /><br />I recommend these, we can now watch our DVR programs while the baby sleeps. Thinking of purchasing another pair. I assume the second headset can p/u signal from the first transmitter."
R1CYMBXIHLPX0S,2,"This product has some perks, It's nice looking, the headphones fit nicely, the charging station is neat. However the draw back is that no matter what I did there was always a humming sound when being used. I read a lot of the other reviews that said it wasn't very loud or distracting but I found it extremely annoying and not something I would put up with to continue to use the product."
R12NSQFPSVTAP6,5,"After much research and reading countless reviews, I settled on this pair of headphones for my wife to use at night so not to disturb our newborn who is in the bedroom with us.  They are prefect, so perfect I'm buying another pair for the living room so I can watch movies and crank the sound which I'm not able to do in our apartment.  Setup took seconds and they are more comfortable then my corded Sony studio headphones I use for work."
R2FILTE6D67WN6,3,"I found this headphones to have very nice 2.1 sound from my computer. I had no hissing noises in the background like some other reviews. Very clear sound with an occasional split second signal loss when moving around house. Battery life seems to be very good. I got these headphones from Dakdepot for $50.00. Refurbished new product was repackaged nicely with a 2 year warranty. Dakdepot does not have a lot of good store reviews, but I rolled the dice and am very satisfied with them. Recieved product in about one week with USPS tracking number.   Some of the negatives are that these headphones tend to get a little uncomfortable on your ears after  1/2 hour or so. These headphones rest on the ear and not around them. Also the instructions are terrible. When you plug adapter into the wall you would expect the on/off indicator light to go on. It doesn't go on untill you have a signal. It's kind of confusing when setting up. After plugging in to computer with adapter provided, inserting a CD, adjusted tuning and volume dial, sound was very nice. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
RQDXYFSKBAQ1C,4,I got them over the weekend from a local place. That way I could listen to them before buying as many times headphones are too bas-y for my taste.<br /><br />These are ultra clear.<br /><br />A little bulky but Ive found those usually provide the better sound.<br /><br />Hiss bothered me until I tried turning the source up high and the headphones down lower. Then it was unnoticeable.  Wish I'd bought them from Amazon for $30 cheaper But I am glad to have been able to hear them first.<br /><br />Im using them for the CD and dvd player. and they have an outstanding range and clarity and I could walk down one floor from the unit and still receive.
R1LGR8JACYDTV2,5,"My husband is deaf in one ear and half deaf in the other, therefore, the  volume on the TV is very loud.  In order to, understandably, keep peace with the neighbors we purchased these headphone on the advice from a friend.  Does the trick.  He can hear and the neighbors can't."
RFK1MQLB5J3T1,1,"I purchased these headphones, to enable me to hear the TV over all the family conversation and noise.  I read the reviews and thought that i could live with \\""a little hissing\\"" noise and I could have put up with the \\""more than a little hissing\\"" noise.  But, what I could not live with was the headphones cutting out every 2-6 minutes; I timed it, and the need to get up cross the room, place the headphones back on to the cradle to get them to sync back up.      Needless to say I have returned these headphones and will be looking for a pair that work.  These do not.  If you are seriously looking to purchase a pair of wireless headphones, keep looking.  These are not worth purchasing at any price. Not to be over dramatic, but I would take these if someone gave them to me for free."
R344KFRRTW6SY4,5,"The best headphone, I recommend to everybody.  excellent.  Sennheiser RS120 great sound quality and do not forget about the price."
R1ZBKL309ZUWN8,5,We bought this for my 92 year old Mother who is hard of hearing.  She kept the volume on her TV up so loud that we couldn't hear what we were listening to. I figure if a 92 year old can operate these with no problem they must be good.  We did check them out for sound quality and ease of use ourselves and we are very pleased with them.
RTA11GYBXFM14,5,"I use these for my wife and I to view 2 seprate TVs, so I change the tuning chanel frequently (she is always finding the better show). My old set up had a 3 way tuning switch and a dial for sound. I find that the dial for channel tuning difficult and too close to the volume dial. I have got it down now with practice. For my father- in-law I taped over the tuning dial so he wouldn't be messing up the chanel tuning when he just wants volume.     Every thing else is great, comfort, sound, the charging system, lenth of charge time, and range."
R2IHUSNPHRYZIZ,5,"These headphone were exactly what I was looking for, a way to watch TV without disturbing anyone else.  They work great and sound great. Installation was easy, just make sure you fully charge them before expecting to hear anything. At first I thought I was hooking them up wrong, but once they were charged for 24 hours they worked perfectly."
R3T35F0A5DY63X,5,"My 10yr old Sony RF headphones finally bit the dust, and these looked like a good replacement. The sound is great and clear, though the bass may not be as defined as the Sony's were. However the sound is sharp and clear, and alleviates my hearing issues. MAINLY - the phones WORK so much better than the Sony's did.  Rarely do I encounter any noticable noise or interferance from the RF transmission. If I do hear a bit of noise or interferance, I can move maybe 1 inch and it goes away. I've been able to listen to clear sound all around the house, even out front taking the trash to the curb.  Very fine product.  Terry"
RNSO52VWO4ODD,3,"Being a Sennheiser set of headphones, this product should have immediately received 5 stars. Their sound quality is literally unmatched in the current market. (That's not to say these headphones have perfect sound quality - if you expect that out of wireless headphones you are up for a disappointment. But I am talking about the relative quality...)    The reason I gave this item only 3 stars is because of the following flaw - they automatically turn off if there is no sound. Imagine yourself watching TV with high volume in order to enjoy it, and then muting the TV for a couple of minutes in order to talk to someone. After a fixed amount of muted time, the transmitter kills itself, which means your ears will be blasted with the horrifying noise of dead reception (like TV's snow noise).    Now this situation can be avoided if you remember to turn off the headphones every time you wish to take a couple minute break, but a. that will be annoying as the on\off switch is not that easy to find every time, b. you will never remember to do that, and c. the problem gets worse: this functionality will also repeat itself in case the movie you are watching has a silent scene which is long enough to trigger the shut-off mechanism. And trust me, it happens more than you think, and when it happens, it usually does in a romantic\terrifying\dramatic moment of the movie - one in which you do not wish to be jerked out of with a blast of noise straight into your ears!!!    To sum this up and be precise, I will have to turn the statement in the second paragraph around: the only reason this product DID receive 3 stars is the relative sound superiority of Sennheiser headphones. But in general, I would recommend to NOT buy it, and find a different product they make, one that doesn't kill itself whenever a little silence is sought."
R291E91ASHO8BH,4,I purchased these headphones to use to watch TV when running on my treadmill. I needed headphones that were lightweight and comfortable.  These headphones work well.  They were easy to set-up with our cable box/DVR. The sound quality is good and the volume is easily adjustable.  They fit my head well and don't fall off when running.  Two thumbs up!
R3P1KEPBA0R6UW,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Senheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]The headphones are the perfect answer for late night TV viewing without interrupting the household. It's also nice to have the option of moving from room to room without missing any part of a program.  They are extremely comfortable and easy to use. The headset does slip forward when looking down, that may be related to the user's head size, so I do not recommend these for kids."
R3OC3OCI8XSJWH,5,"I purchased these headphones so that I could play various Wii games without disturbing my wife while she read or worked on her computer.  The headphones are comfortable with pretty decent sound reproduction.  I have read other reviews where people had problem with noise, but I've have not experienced that. I did have to try a couple of different audio outputs to make sure I had a high enough signal. The range reaches most of our condo."
R2GLLDOWWK9UUU,4,Pleasantly surprised at how good these wireless headphones sound. Good bass and crisp treble. The charging cradle is simple to use. Overall a great product.
R12MQMEK95EVF,2,"The wireless headphones produce great sound but....  -The ear pieces are open which forces everyone near you to hear the music as well.  -The transmiter is very touchy, cannot be placed near metal.  -The auto signal finder works about 50% of the time and there is no way override it.  -Overall: great price, great sound qualitly, poor features."
RPZXMCEREFNGY,5,"Excelent for TV, easy to set up and use, maintains high quality as I walk throuugh the house, a good value vs alternatives."
R180J8EX6UBQJS,5,"Being a cheap person, I originally bought a $25 pair of wireless headphones from Wal-Mart.  There was static, humming & the speakers rattled with any increase in volume in what I was watching.  I checked out the reviews on the Sennheiser RS 120 on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  THEY WORK GREAT.  The sound is great and there is no background noise.  The only downside is as others have written; they do tend to fall off if you lean to far forward."
RE2C2M1VH15WH,3,"These Sennheiser headphones are comfortable and well made. They sound really good when they are working. The issue I have is they jump to static for no reason whatsoever. You will be listening and then just static. No one touches the tuning control, you don't move or anything. It really gets irritating."
R2UV7IWMG917IF,4,"If you are simply going to lay in bed and watch tv, without disturbing others, the head phones are nice. They do not have heavy base, but there is a nice full sound. If you want to walk around, sometimes they cut out, and my par, while tuning them, picked up my neighbors phone call. Over all, I have been very happy and for the price, they are great."
R27XTE8LP1KN8Q,2,"Could not get good sound quality, regardless of settings.  Even when staying within 15 feet of the transmitter."
R1OMXC94H3094T,4,"The Sennheiser works well and was easy to hook up. It is rather large and clunky on your head.That being said, for the price, I would highly recommend it for someone who has a hearing loss or anyone who doesn't want to annoy someone while you are listening to TV."
R3CJX1LOTRBFC7,5,"As an an owner of the impressive Sennheiser HD-280, I thought I would give them another shot when I was in the market for wireless headphones. They did not disappoint even a bit. I just got the product from Amazon and hooked it up to my TV. The sound quality is almost as good as its wired one that I own, with almost no noise interference. And it does have incredible bass. This is another stellar product from Sennheiser. If you are thinking of getting a wireless headphone, this is a great choice with which you won't go wrong."
R3NVM2LT61B9LZ,3,"I purchased the RS120 and was not happy with the loose fit on the head. I use a size L helmet so I don't think my head is too small but the RS120 will not fit comfortably if you move around and it will be too large for kids.<br />I decided to not buy a second RS120 but to buy a RS130 (2 headphones with 1 base). The advantages of the RS130 over the RS120:<br />- much better fit on the head (circumaural headphone surround your ear like the Bose Quietcomfort 2, not a flat thing against your ear like the RS120)<br />- better sound quality (again circumaural design blocks better external noise, and leak less sound from the headphone) and SRS surround feature improves against standard stereo<br />- auto-tuning of the signal (you don't need to use the manual tuning button of the RS120)<br />- better quality build (controls/switches are much better quality on the RS130 than the RS120)<br /><br />The base of the RS120 is not compatible with the RS130 mainly because of the surround sound feature.<br />I get the same quality whether I use only 1 or both headsets.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend the RS130 over the RS120, and if this is an investment for you, the price difference seems justified to me. Look on Amazon for a kit with 2 headphones and 1 base, you get it for the full price of one headphone that you would find on other sites."
R13MJULDW8B93K,5,"We were very pleased with the quality of this product.    It came quickly; instructions a little sparse, but talk with technician enabled us to make a successful hook-up to an old tv (with NO audio output jack!.  With technician's  help and trial and error, we did it thru the vcr/videodisc player and by using BOTH the vcr remote and the tv remote.  Technician was excellent+"
R384ZQKL8YPHF6,5,"After researching a number of wireless headphones, I settled on the RS120.  As I'm writing this review, I am sitting in another room typing and listening to the tv.  No matter where I am in the house, the sound clarity is perfect.  Outdoors, within 25 feet of the house...the same.  Any further and the quality starts falling off.  Easy to hook up.<br />  I have owned these for close to a month and highly recommend the RS120 as a great buy."
ROE18IDF3XH93,2,"I bought two sets of these headphones, one for use in my bedroom and one for the living room. The first night I set them up they worked perfectly for 2 hours. The next day I was not able to receive a signal at all in the living room, although the bedroom pair was working fine. I swapped them around and discovered each pair worked fine in the bedroom, but not in the living room. I bought a long cable extension to move the transmitter out of the living room, but that didn't help.    I must be getting some kind of interference from somewhere. The bedroom pair started picking up static as well after a week, so I gave up on them. I would rather have a wire connection and know I will have good sound than wonder if my headphones are going to be working or not. But you may not have the interence problems I have. When they work they are good headphones."
R3T2TVFE5LZIT,4,"We recently moved and now have our TV in a more open space.  As a result, I couldn't always hear the TV above the family's conversation and/or activity.  These headphones solved the problem -- I can watch and hear a TV show no matter what's going on around me.  And they really come in handy when I'm the last one up and everyone else is in bed -- I don't have to worry about disturbing anyone.  As others have indicated, the only minor problem I found is that they do not stay securely on my head when I am moving around (which is why I only gave them 4 stars).  Nevertheless, I am considering getting a second headset for my husband."
R1A4RRKCJ4RZ22,5,"Ordering: a breeze.  Price:reasonable.  Product: exceptional(Both).  Wife: happy.  Dog: mixed, no cord to trip over, but none to chew either."
R1S6S35KSPIBVP,1,"I am very disappointed with this product. The signal doesn't go as far as I expected, there is a lot of static interference, the sound is hard to balance, and the headphone band doesn't contract small enough to fit a woman's head snugly."
R10R22XGY2PZ1U,1,"Had to return this. Didn't work. Mostly wouldn't pick up anything - just got static..couple of times able to get a good connection, didn't last but a few minutes. Tried everything. Just didn't work for us. Too bad, really need something so my husband can hear the tv without having the sound turned up so loud."
RJXBFDSN7Q0QB,1,"I wanted them so I could listen to the TV while my husband read, or vice versa.  But it turns out that the sound level on the headphones is totally dependent on the volume of the TV.  In other  words, if the TV is muted, nothing comes out of the headphones.  And by the way, even if the TV volume is turned on, the headphone volume (even when set at maximum) is very, very low.  These headphones are a huge disappointment and a waste of money."
RULGUGBUKN0Z,4,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 to wear around the office. A coworker has the same set and recommended them. Once we figured out how to set the channels so that we weren't getting interference from each others headsets they worked great. The Sennheiser RS120 deliver good quality sound and decent bass response. I was amazed at how far the range is. I have walked out into the parking lot with them on a distance of at least 75 feet. The styling is clean and functional. The fit is comfortable but a tad bit loose for those with a smaller head.   I would recommend these based on good price, performance and quality design."
RNOJPJP0MS0BV,5,"If a person buys the same product twice, it must meet expectations. This headset does. I have one pair in the bedroom and now the second set in the den. Value is very good, as is sound and range. The charging stand is what sets the RS120 apart from most of the cheaper competitors."
R1U1UGB2U2Y2ZY,4,"As other reviewers have said, the headphones will fall off your head A LOT if you look down.  I have this problem less when wearing a hat.  Head phones dont swivel horizontal which make it hard to get a precise fitting on ears and hard to just listen to one head phone.  Music or radio sound is not isolated to just your head but can be heard from others then yourself.  These are just nit-picking complaints.  Other then that the sound is great and range is great to. 4 stars because of the sound and range."
R3JSMKMN43FIW4,3,"There are 2 ways to buy the Sennheiser RS120, direct from Amazon you will pay a few $'s more but if you buy from Electronics Expo read the fine print as if you elect to return it you will pay a 20% restock plus the return ship charges!    In reading reviews prior to ordering there were comments about \\""hissing\\""  which I did not experience. In fact the audio sound was very good.     The problem that caused me to return the Sennheiser is that the ear pieces are not cupped as I have had with earlier units purchased. The ear contact surface is flat and no matter the range of adjustments I tried I could not prevent the entire head set from slipping off my head as I worked at my desk.    Hopefully, if you buy the model RS120 your head is wide enough to tighten  the set to remain in place as you take full advantage to be able to have movement with this wireless product!"
R8FZUFCJ5S7N9,3,"They fit good,are very comfortable. You can wear them for a long time with no discomfort. Battery life is very good. The controls are good as well. The one problem I have is when you get more then 30 feet away or go into another room. You occasionally get these sharp clicking, crackling and poping attacks. No matter what volume your playing them at , these attacks come in at FULL volume. But if you stay close..."
R37ARQ1WXKYZA3,5,I have these for 8 years. Best headphones ever. Bought it for my mum and my grandma. Very comfortable and long lasting. You also never worry about charging. Just put it overnight on the charger and it'll last for WEEKS!
R3APJP95TXRWF6,5,"this is the second wireless headset i purchased for the family.the first one was difficult to tune, had poor clarity and range so i went for the upgrade.    from the first minute out of the box, i was able to get it working immediately without reading the instructions ( not too savvy with electronics)both of my children ages 8 and 7 can use it without difficulty. the sound is CLEAR, no interference from other household electronics, once the frequency is tuned it stays, the ear pads are REAL comfortable and drown out any external noise, adjusatable for both me and the kids.    overall i am very satisfied with the headset. you  get what you pay for and this one was at a great price."
R2FS9TA4NVAL1B,4,"I am very satified with these earphones.  The work great, with little or no static or background noise.  I use them every night.  It's nice to be able to recharge them at will."
R1DZF6SBTUXMI5,1,They didn't work. Only got static so I sent them back. Instructions weren't good and I didn't get any help from the maker. They just said to read the help section on the website which was not any help either.
R81KCNXHKOHDG,5,"Great device. I bought it for my father (he has very limited hearing). Now he can watch TV without waking everyone up. The sound is wonderful, battery life is more than expected; all in a very elegant design. Just beautiful. Only thing that bothers a little is the tunning wheel being so close to the volume. If you have the set on, you might turn the wrong wheel when trying to touch the volume."
R13CFMX4WK7SS1,5,"I am very pleased with these headphones. They have no glitches. You have to remember that when they don't get a signal there is no squelch feature so you get bombarded with static. So switch off, a great feature, to avoid this.  The other thing is that the ad on the seller MUST MUST MUST contain all, not most, of the features. I had to dig a lot to find out about the adaptability of the jacks to what ever sender is being used. But it was there. So, Amazon sellers cover all all all features and you will sell more. This is my place to complain about Amazon's amazing lack of willingness to specify mode of shipping before you push (and sometimes even after) you press the conform order button."
R31IKYK70L039N,3,"Product duz provide adequate reception from TV, little bulky, do love the privacy with my ears on. Adjustment controls are clunkie and cheap, but then what can one expect for $70, it works. Should have spent more for a better product. Maybe next time"
R1JQM4SUSDWQ4F,5,Works just as advertised and at a great price.    Sounds better than my high-end TV speakers.    Highly recommended.
R3PZDDKN2SI422,1,"I bought two of these and returned two.     Pros:  Their pretty, easy to hook up and everything is included.    Cons:  very unconfortable fit.          you have to TUNE the set MANUALLY with a button            right next to the volume control.          Constant Loud Hiss regardless of where tuned.         Acoustics poor."
R3TVGG11JBWZ4I,5,"These headphones were reviewed highly by others, which is why I considered them. The clincher was the reduction in price. These phones have rich bass sounds and make one feel that he is right there with the orchestra or vocalist. I recommend them enthusiastically."
R21S7MTOV8JDUF,3,"I read many reviews on this product before deciding to purchase and overall they are terrific headphones, but for some reason most people didn't mention the two most irritating things about these.     1) If your sound source stops for say 5 minutes, you are suddenly blasted with incredibly loud white noise that really can hurt your ears!    2) Overly loud sound in spots will noticeably diminish the volume of the music.    I've learned that the unfortunate cause of these are the following \\""features\\"" of the unit which cannot be changed/adjusted or turned off as far as I know.  1) Auto power off mode of the base after 5 minutes of silence.  2) Aggressive Automatic Volume Gain    It seems that when the unit powers off after 5 minutes of silence, the automatic gain kicks in, and amplifies the silence tremendously to the point where all of a sudden, you get a blast of whitenoise that's really loud. I've trained myself to just turn the headphones switch off when my sound source stops (aka, if some interruption causes me to pause the music for abit, or the tv show I'm watching), and to start the sound source again (music or tv) prior to turning the phones back on, so as to avoid the loud noise. It's a pain, and I still get caught by surprise sometimes, but it's mostly managable.    Also in music that has a large change in volume, you can hear the phones cut down the signal significantly when the loud spot comes in. It's very annoying and can ruin the true feel of the music.    Despite these major issues, these headphones are otherwise fantastic, and it's a true shame these issues were not addressed prior to production and cannot be addressed after the fact either.     The phones are very comfortable to wear, the sound reproduction is excellent, and I've not had much in the way of interference wearing them (although I don't stray far from the base unit). The manual tuning control is not really a big deal as I've rarely had to set it more than the one time initially, and saves money on the more expensive unit they sell.    I'm still happy with the purchase and have managed to live with the 2 major issues, but I wanted to make sure the next person was aware of the problems before buying. From what I could tell reading other reviews, the higher priced models from Sennheiser have the same issues.    If they can correct these issues in future models, I would buy them in a heart beat since I don't think the other companies offerings are nearly as good."
R3Q41YTSJKPJIG,4,"The sound quality is very good. I have several different wireless controls and a wifi network, but nothing interfered with the headset.  Simple installation, usable as soon as batteries charge.  Headset fit could be a little better -- more snug."
R2K1RDPX83ZJTV,2,I really wanted to like this product but it just does not perform up to expectations. Despite increasing the gain on the receiver there was a hiss you could never escape. The sound quality was OK but hardly analytical and detailed as described. The high and very lows were good for headphones but the midrange is muddy. Pop rock sounds great but more demanding music ties it up in knots.     The one fatal flaw though is the volume auto adjust if you dont have music playing all the time you can get a sudden painful blast of noise. This is the main reason I rarely use it.     I did let the headphones 'burn in' for 40 hrs before coming to a conclusion it does help but but it is hard get over the problems with the wireless equipment.
RX0VQZO6R2FIG,4,"Great sound, but..., February 16, 2009   By  Peter H. Freeman \\""Sordonomas\\"" (Virginia) - See all my reviews           I am very happy with this product. The ear phones' sound quality is great, almost like being in a theatre, but better since you can adjust the volume. Now I am able to enjoy T.V. without irritating my wife, who retires early and in waking hours dislikes the sound of sport casts and action movies. I like being able to keep listening to talking heads if I leave the room and stop watching the screen.     I did not find there to be any buzz or background noise (a complaint of one reviewer) when plugged into the t.v. audio out. The phones also work well with my radio/music system, though I notice some white noise when the instrumental volume drops off or there is a pause.     My complaints: I had to return the first order because the transmitter wasn't functioning, which I had to discover by first testing the converter for output. The transmitter failed to launch. (My neighbor had the same problem when he bought them on my recommendation.) Second, the operating instructions are minimal and don't cover trouble shooting. Third, the ear phones fit rather loosely, such that if you bend over they will fall off. Fourth, the transmitter is a little quirky. A red light is supposed to illuminate when it is 'charging'...charging what? The transmitter itself? The earphones as they sit on the cradle? Wireless charging of the ear phones? (I have already replaced the earphone batteries that came with the shipment). And when the transmitter is functioning (transmitting)a green light illuminates. I have noticed that the it sometimes does not illuminate until the t.v. is turned on, but continues lit when the t.v. is turned off. Nothing in the accompanying literature explains the above."
R2D9QLZE7WQO1V,4,"I dont have any experience with wireless headphones so its hard to compare it with. However, I do have a pair of Sennheisers that are about 20yrs old and they still function & sound great.     After minor adjustments and tuning to the correct frequency these RS120 work well. My only complaint is that they have a slight hiss. This hiss is barely noticible though. Also, I'm quite impressed with the range."
R1X73BKEGQQHG,5,"Love it!  Have trouble reducing the soound, however,  to a level most comfortable for my ears."
RHDY6KR38C19C,2,"Quality of sounds is good. 2 things I don't like are that there is an analog tuner to tune in the sound. What is the point of that? There is a stereo input coming directly from the TV. What is there to tune? In my opinion it only allows you to take what should be quality at 100% if left alone, and allow you to reduce the quality. Pointless. The second thing is that they headphones are not molded around your ear so if you move you head slightly they fall offf real easily. I have to lie really still in bed to make sure that they don't fall off my ears. Otherwise they are as advertised."
R177AEU90Q90M5,4,"I'm a little hard of hearing and needed something to help me out. This product fits the bill very well. The sound is superb and stereo. Easy to use and no dead spots. The pads on the ear pieces are a little uncomfortable and itchy. Other then that, I'm very pleased."
R3P6OFUUZ6SBZO,5,"Easy set up and great sound, no outside interference,and good range, just what I wanted..."
R2W75ZP7I2WCMR,1,"Product did not meet my expectations but did arrive in a timely fashion.  Very happy with both shipment and service, just not the product.  I do not recommend this to customers for a future purchase as it's range was limited and was too easy to have interfenece with it, even moving my head caused it to act up."
R22MM4BKD3JC2R,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]  I bought one of the wireless headphones [with the charging cradle] and absolutely love it; so much, I'm ordering two more today.    The sound is absolutely incredible with my newer flat screen televisions.    I did run into a problem with my older television sets.  By the time I reduced the volume of the television to the point nobody else in the room could hear it.... I couldn't hear the sound in the headphones.  At very low volume on the television, there was too much noise in the headphones.  However, this problem was easily rectified.  I connected two Y Audio Adapters to my Cable Box's Audio OUT LEFT/RIGHT.  The headphones are connected to one portion of the Y Adapter and the Television's audio IN is connected to the other side of the Y Adapters.  NOW... I just put the television on MUTE when I use the headphones."
RCFRZULELXL6,5,"Sennheiser headphones are the best. Bought 2 pairs, one for the bedroom and one for the living room. I can walk all over the house and listen to the tv. It's like having a mini surrondsound system on your head, every audio detail is amazing. The other nice thing is I can tune in either tv on the headsets in case I want both headsets on the same tv. These are well worth the money."
R1LHMHPQN7VS71,1,"The product was given as a Christmas present.  After it was opened, it was found to be defective.  The covering on the earpiece was coming unwrapped, the battery wouldn't charge, and there was corrosion in the  battery compartment.  They were never used."
R3T49YR6S43X37,5,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones because I have conductive hearing loss which cannot be helped by a hearing aid.  My husband and family have been constantly bombarded by the volume I needed to be able to hear my programs.  Now we have the tv set at a low level appropriate for everyone else.  I can even move all around the house to far rooms and still know what's going on in my show.  I can even set the volume to \\""0\\"" and still hear great (handy if the other person in the room is trying to read, etc.).    I dropped it once and thought I had broken it but all I had to do was reset the batteries and tuning and I was \\""good to go!\\""    Wish I had gotten one years ago!"
R3V2KZWDNZ3BLJ,5,"I wear two hearing aids and still have difficulty hearing certain sounds, especially the frequency of womens voices or soft spoken people like the British.  I decided to purchase this headset after reading reviews and it has been fantastic.  I remove my aids and I now hear all voices, movie music and background sounds like I never experienced before the purchase.  I plug the transmitter into my microphone outlet on my TV and can hear all channels and movie DVD's with tremendous clarity.  My wife can set the volume she wants independently on the TV and I use the headset's volume control to adjust it to my needs.  CAUTION - You should check if your TV will cut off sound through it's speakers when plugging into the mic outlet. Some models/brands might do that. I tried an airline type headset before ordering to make sure it would work.  It's great. Also, very easy to set up."
R2D6QQ2EIE9HD4,5,"I've had the headphones for about 3 weeks now, primarily for TV watching. Once I got the set-up right (more on that later), I couldn't believe the clarity on these. I have a hearing problem and always used closed-caption to help. Now I don't need it. They are crystal clear, with no pops or crackling sounds.  My kids agreed the dialog was much clearer than just listening to the tv speakers.    SET-UP ISSUES: My only knock is the lack of set-up help in the instructions. It shows a small picture and mentions using RCA jacks to hook up to an output source.  However, the front of my TV has only input jacks and an HPJ hole (Head Phone Jack). The back of my TV was inaccessible without moving some of the wall unit, so I tried with the front HPJ first. I plugged the two RCA jacks into the smaller adapter and placed it into the hole. Well, the headphones worked, but the tv speakers automatically shut off. Also, not only did I hear the dreaded pops and cracks  as well as the beeping for a lost signal sometimes, but the sound would shut off every 3 minutes for about 3 seconds, causing me to rewind (luckily I have a DVR) each time.  I used it like this for 2 weeks before I decided to call Sennhieser and Panasonic (TV).      They basically said I should try to find the outputs on the back of my TV. After I finally got back there, I saw tons of wires. Some going to a VCR, some to my Cable box/dvr some going to my stereo. The only two output jacks were being used to go into the back of the cable box. I unplugged one of the inputs and put one of the headphone inputs in. I was now able to hear one side of the tv speakers and one side of the headphones. Not what I wanted.  I figured out that a splitter might work and went to radioshack.     I bought one splitter (single male with two females) for the red input and same for the black input (about $4.50 each).  I plugged the male end from the tv into one of the female ends of the splitter. I then plugged the male end from the headphonebase into the other female. Then I plugged the single male from the splitter into the female of the cable box. Then did the same for the other side.  Now, the TV AND the headphones both worked at the same time and all the crackling, pops and lost signal went away!  Then I had to go to the audio set-up of my TV and saw there were two options that shut down the TV speakers. When I choose either one, it allows the sound to come from the headphones only (which I use at night when no-one is in the room).  When I want to listen to the headphones with the TV (family watching together), I just change the setting to speakers on and they can hear the tv and I can independently change the volume on my headphones.     Bottom line for me is that these worked beyond my expectations, once I had the set-up correct. Highly recommended as long as you set it up the right way."
R1KYV0FZ3U2GDU,5,"After 2 Sony units and 1 Radio Shack, I finally got the right headphone.     I'm 69 and have a hard time understanding some of the speech on tv (even with volume turned up).  My wife complained all the time about me having the tv so loud.  Now I can set the tv at a \\""normal\\"" level and I can adjust the volume on the headphone to the level that's comfortable for me.  Finally I can enjoy tv like I did before my hearing problems."
RPVAT9ZRTKGEL,1,"I usually read the reviews about a product before I buy something I'm unsure of.  After reading several of the most helpful reviews I decided to purchace these headphones.  I've never been more dissatisfied with a product I've purchased from Amazon.  All of the good reviews in my opinion are coming from people who have damaged their ears, and/or don't mind the obvious and annoying feeback, the instability of the connection, and the bursts of volume shooting into your ear because of that instability.  The tuner/channels/volume are the only control's you have beside the range and other things causing interferance.  And after an hour of trying to get the darn things to stay clear using the channel/tuner/volume, I had no success, and only much frustration and pain due to speaker shreiks as I call them.  So I quit, and am sending them back.  I would write more but I have to split.  Bottom line, buy at your own risk.  ~Seraph"
R2PLGMQXV1L9HR,5,"These headphones have outstanding fidelity, low hiss, range that is amazing!  I can be the opposite corners of my yard, across the street, or in my garage working and the sound is amazing.  I like the three channels to select a free frequency.      These headphones may be the most comfortable I've found but the one thing that may hinder use is that they do seem to slip a bit if you are looking down or up so trying to work in these is tough, but face it...  with a set like these you'll be sitting and listening in a comfortable chair anywhere within a large area.  Fantastic product that is well worth the money."
R3S32PL4CDNCSM,4,"the headphone are huge, just to let u know. the reception is excellent for almost 100 yards"
R3FGVL7R5C651W,2,I am dissapointed with these headphones because the tv needs to be too loud for others in order for the headphones to work. I purchesed these in order to hear the tv without disturbing my wife.
R181I29NXFOY9T,3,"This set of headphones is good but not great as many reviews would lead you to believe. The sound quality is good, the fit is at best OK (they are on ear and do not lay flat) and may cause some issues with sound quality. The multiple channel feature is rather annoying and can cause a loud static session in your ear if not careful. I have become accustomed to using them but a novice user may find them difficult to use and get used to."
R3BHH5IU2UBWP5,3,"While the headphones get the job done with their ability to wirelessly broadcast the audio from my pc to wherever I am in my apartment, my experience with them has been slightly sub-par.    The main issue is that there is a constant hiss.  While this may be due to interference, or perhaps the use of the attachment to connect to my computer's headphone out, it still exists and adjusting the channels does not completely address the problem.    Another gripe is when the transmitter does not receive an audio signal (such as when their is a ten second gap in playback) rather than have the headphones go silent the result is that the headphones blast a very loud static noise, much louder than you can ever purposely adjust the headphones to.  This noise is painful and will hurt your ears until either you take them off or the audio signal continues.  This can occur while simply stopping one song and then searching for another song in your library; take too long and you will be punished.  I say this is a gripe because, once learned, it becomes avoidable.    In any case, the headphones are acceptable to me for their stated purpose with the limitations listed above.  If wireless headphones are a priority, and the above items are not gamestoppers for you, this product will suffice.  If the above items overweigh the wireless need, continue your search."
R7CH0CLYFTN2S,1,"I ended up returning the product because there was just too much feedback.<br /><br />I have a lot of electronics in my house, especially in the living room which probably caused it. I even turned them all off and still i got bad feedback.<br /><br />For the most part, they are good, but i just couldn't take the continuous feedback and hissing."
R15FCLP3Y8WVEH,4,"This is a light-weighted wireless headphone.  I put it on for one hour and feel nothing uncomfortable.  I don't need to replace batteries because the charging cradle does it for me.  I do not give 5 stars because the volume control dial does not have numbers.  If it has number markings, you can adjust the volume more precisely.  But, I still recommend it."
R31ZRG31X15PDQ,5,"My wife loves them, and it let's me sleep in peace.  The clarity is good and there is no static whatsoever.  Very easy to use, but could use longer cables/cords.  That would help with more placement options. It's not the most comfortable headphone for a long period of time, but it's good for most occasions.  There is not a lot of padding and they tend to fall forward when you look down.  But overall it's a good product and great price.  I would recommend them."
RD6RQEDZT2B2S,4,"Bought these for an 84-year-old to hear the TV.  She has not tried them yet.  I attached them to my iPod and they sound great to my 56-year-old ears.  Comfortable, although (as many reviewers have noted) when you bend down you need to hold them on or slide the top to the back of your head. Super easy to set up.  Built-in male red and white RCA plugs, with extensions provided for 1/8th inch iPod style and old-school 1/4 inch guitar-amp style plugs.    The headphones do need to be tuned to the signal from the base station, which is the reason for 4 stars, not 5.  For 5 years I had 4 IR earphones in a Suburban for the DVD-game player.  Little kids had nothing but problems with the tuners on the headphones.  They would try to change the volume but change the tuner and \\""lose the station\\"" instead, then whine in frustration, but there was nothing I could do when I was driving.  (OK, I'm the one whining now.)  I am concerned that the 84-year-old will have the same problem.  Seems to me this is OK technology for engineers, but not for very old or young people.  It would be better to set it at a particular channel than to have the tuner infinitely variable and very, very easy to change.  (PS  I ended up taping the tuner in the Suburban.  Then I stopped using the DVD player unless someone was sitting back there who could manage the tuner situation.  And change the DVD when a movie ended.  The little kids would beg for the DVD player, but when there was no \\""manager\\"" I played CDs of Laura Ingalls and Beverly Cleary stories and that worked.)    That said, the RS120 headphones tuned very easily for me with no background noise walking from room to room.  I will let you know how they work for the 84-year-old.  *******    A month later:      Well, she says they changed her life.  Best addition to her life since her dog.  She does not need to use the captions on the TV anymore.  She got a new DVD player so she can watch movies, too.  (The old player was broken, but she did not care because she could not hear it.)  She can watch TV and DVDs in the wee small hours without waking the whole neighborhood.  The earphones are a little wobbly in the holder/charger and have to be set just so or they won't charge, but this does not bother her.  There is a bright red LED light that tells you they are set in there correctly so they can charge.  She has no issues with the amount of time she can use them between charges. I don't think she has ever run out of charge.  We tuned them to the base station and put Scotch tape on the tuner wheel when we set them up for her.  She has no issues with tuning them.  The tape stayed in place."
R1ZVXHC4LTER82,5,"Spent a lot of time reading reviews and trying to make a decision based on overall value and performance. All the reviews I've read for every wireless headset has been chock full of reviews on both ends of the spectrum. I made the decision to purchase this headset simply because it was the only one with somewhat consistent reviews, and I had a gift card from Christmas, so I figured if they weren't up to snuff I wouldn't be out any real money.     So far these earbuds are fantastic. I am using these with my computer for watching movies, listening to music, and playing games. I'm also a rower and use these while on my indoor rower, which was the biggest reason for getting wireless as opposed to the tried and true wired buds. After getting them tuned to the right signal I have been pleasantly surprised with the audio quality and signal strength. Sound better than my speaker system. Depth of sound seems fuller and richer.     Granted, I don't wander far away from the base, and they do get static and pop a little when I walked to the other room to test the signal (I'm in a concrete building where nothing travels through the walls). But for me I never intend to use them this way, so I don't have a problem. If you are planning to roam a lot with wireless headphones I think you are bound to have some signal problems.     They are also very comfortable to wear. Charging is simple and very effective. It's nice that they automatically turn off when placed back on the base. Haven't really tested the battery life of a single charge as I'm always placing them back on the base, so I suppose I could say the battery life sure hasn't given me any problems.     If you are looking for good quality buds without the wires, this is a great option. Would buy again."
R3AAAP2KQJY26C,5,"I am a little hesitated to buy a wireless phone while going through all the reviews for these kinds of products. Now I am very satisfied with RS120. The sound quality is pretty good for watching TV. It still bursts out a short term of \\""hiss\\"" but it only lasts a few second and happened rarely. I am considering buying another one for my parent."
R6MN0EOH6YU3F,4,"Opened box, installed batterys, plugged in power and audio cable. Works great, have a inside range of 200 feet. Outside about 500 depending on buildings between source and headphones.    Battary's hold up good 8 hours continious use. Chargeing cradle is a cool design. Used for Medical Transcription reports has good canceling of room noise.    Noticed some hum and interferance, but adjusting the dial on headphones clears it up.    Do not like that the adjustment is close to others so you can move tuneing in error."
R26FGFUH1DIWRD,5,This review is brief and to the point. I am absolutely delighted with the headphones. I have had previous brands and this one is by far the most superior. The quality of sound is excellent. I do have a hearing impairment which restricts the upper frequencies. I would encourage the company to consider creating a unit that more adequately addresses this impairment in people like me.  A great set of earphones.
R2SZF56FDRXACB,4,"Sound and range is good. My only problem is the power adapter, which is a pain if I want to move the base unit, and the plug that connects into the base unit comes out easily, and is difficult to get back in. Otherwise I'm very happy with the purchase."
R3FM0WARF0W45O,5,"I have literally used these headphones every day since I received them. They sound good and I really like the way they automatically recharge in their cradle. I use a little eternal switch box to choose between TV or XM receiver input. The only drawback I have found is that with the volume/tuning controls on the back of the headphones, if you lean back with your head on a pillow you can inadvertently move dials as you turn your head. I wish the controls were on the front."
R3MMA9CYF01ZHI,4,The RS120 Wireless RF Headphones work great. It has better than expected bass response. I use it to watch movies and tv shows. It works throughout my home and is very convenient when I need to leave the living room to do something.  It stays on frequency almost perfectly.  This is a keeper.  I love it.  The only negative is that the headphones slip off the head pretty easily when I bend over. The batteries last longer than a 3 hr movie.
R2QGKMBRJMKP3Y,4,"Wow!  I can now hear and understand what they are saying on TV. They work just fine!  I even walked out to my parking space with them and didn't miss a bit of the football game.  I use them for TV but checked them out on my cd (music)player and the sound was very good!!  They are very light....but.... if I walk around with them on, they will slip off pretty easily.  The battery seems to take a long time  to recharge.  That is, it takes a while for the light to turn green.  Many times I'll be using it while still on the red. It works fine, just the same, and has not been a problem.. You also must be careful to make sure the headset is on the charger evenly or it won't charge properly.  Finally, they may be German but they are made in China....of course.    Bottom line, I am satisfied and would recommend them to friend and foe alike...  PS"
R396LRWAI55K5Z,4,"For what you get, it's an excllent vaue. I purchased the 120 for my partner who has significant hearing loss, so that I wasn't subjected to inordinately loud volume when he watches TV and I am in another room trying to listen to music.  Achievement of my aim to have liitle or no sound coming from the TV was only partly realized since the TV out rca jacks must have a reasonable volume for the transmitter to work. Too low TV volume and the headphones need too much gain which introduces extraneous noise. With the TV at a normal listening level, that all disappears and the sound is quite acceptable, and he is quite pleased with the result.  So if your aim is to reduce excessive volume in the room, they work quite effectively, However the headphones do not work with the TV on mute, so for my purpose a different setup may have been better. If your partner has hearing loss and you watch TV together, it's an excellent solution."
R1YJF65IGDWKGL,5,"The headphones I purchased for my partner have enabled me to get a good, quiet night's sleep while he watches whatever programs he wants as late as he wants!!!"
R1QUKU3Y23QZ63,4,"These headphones have been as useful as I had hoped. The sound quality is excellent and is maintained as I have moved about the house (I've gone outside the house once with them; the clarity was still strong, with only slight static).  They are comfortable and would be good for long periods of wear.  The only drawback I have experienced is when bending over, I have had some difficulty keeping them on my head.  I would definitely recommend them to a friend."
R25N6NLORW9LRR,4,"We love these headphones--my husband was a firefighter for 37 years and needed to get sleep when he could and had his own room at the dept.  Due to this past history he liked it quiet when he did sleep so he could hear the siren for emergencies.  I need to use these so the music or t.v. programs I listen to, do not bother him at night.  Love the quality as we have great theatre sound systems so we are used to good sound and these are a good quality product!!  I would purchase them again!!"
R39SOCX8QC6NPI,5,"My dad has the habit of falling asleep while watching TV downstairs. I think he's also going deaf because he turns the volume extremely loud yet still manages to snore through it all.    I have a job but I can't afford to pay rent on top of all my other bills, so I did the next best thing and spent 70 dollars on a pair of magical headphones to keep my father entertained while watching Harry Potter movies so I can fall asleep and get to work on time.    These are a must buy for any man that is going deaf. If you are completely deaf, these will do you no good."
R3JQ6A9RLQDMY4,1,"I researched for a pair of wireless headphones for 1 week in several websites, even checked lots of reviews in Amazon (specially the bad ones). But since this product is showing an incredible amount of good reviews I decided to purchase them and they worked perfectly for the first 2 weeks. I even though of entering another 5 stars review in Amazon, but in the third week they just started turning off after a couple of minutes of usage. I did all the troubleshooting but honestly they just do not work as marketed. Since I'm still under the 30 day warranty, Amazon refunded my money.  Bottom line, whenever shopping around take the bad reviews into consideration because people usually leave a good or excellent review for the first days of usage. Big mistake !!! This headphones are not reliable at all. I'm going back to the japanesse."
R2IAOMKQ06ZZA4,2,"This product suffers from some horrible interference, randomly blasting static at about double the volume of the source. Additionally, rather than having an intelligent power save functionality, the headphones will output the same static noise continuously if the base station goes into sleep mode while the headphones are on. Since this can happen after just a couple of minutes, one needs to be very careful when pausing the source that they are watching.  Aside from the deafening static issues, the product has seemingly awesome battery life and sound quality (considering the price and the wireless connection), but the static blasts are a deal breaker."
R3SC85TBB502JD,5,"I purchased the RS120 for my 87 year old mother for Christmas because she was having trouble hearing the TV. She raved about it so much I bought a set for myself. I raved about them so much, my boss, who is slightly hard of hearing bought a set. He loves them and his wife called me to tell me that they can now watch TV at a normal level instead of turned way up so her husband can hear it.   They set up easy and are crystal clear; I couldn't recommend them more."
R7ETT8A7WF8RI,5,I sleep late and need to watch TV before I go to sleep. Now I can do that without waking my wife. It also hooks up to the computer to let me listen to podcasts without having to be in front of the computer.
R3H5THY6TDPI5A,4,"These headphones seem to do the job. I bought them as a gift for my dad. He likes to watch tv in bed but doesn't want to wake up my mother. He said they work great, no complaints. They did seem a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for."
R3BVPX8OCBY2F7,5,I purchased this about 2 weeks ago.  Plugged it into my directv receiver.  Works perfectly throughout my house with no noticeable interference.  I use it to watch tv in the bedroom.  I have had no problems with it turning off.  I am recommending this product to family and friends.  The only thing is that the headphones and charging station were larger than expected but I should have realized the size just by looking at the picture.  The headphones are very comfortable to wear.
R140VI803A5T0,5,"This is, by far, the best wireless headphones I have ever owned, and I've probably purchased 8 to 10 over the years.  The sound quality is superb - and this is so whether or not my hearing aids are in. I like the feature that the headphones, when not in use, sit on a cradle that automatically keeps them charged; thus, for my listening situation, I never have to consciously charge them.    Although this model is somewhat heavier than infrared phones I've used, the added weight is not too bothersome.  And, they are lighter than previously-owned RF headphones."
R8FA1S08R42EH,4,"Overall this model is pretty good being that it is at the lower end of the product line for Sennheiser.  I really like the charging feature and the fact that it has rechargeable AAA batteries.  For me, the only drawback was the way the headphones fit on my ears.  Being that I wear hearing aids this model wouldn't work well for me as it would fit onto my ears and not over as some of the higher end models do.  Being that it was a gift to someone else it was perfect.  I highly recommend this brand over all of the others out there.  I've had my RS110 for 6 years now and have replaced the rechargeable batteries 2x.  Well worth the money."
R36QGVOC73P5LZ,5,These work great.I like them as much as BOSE headphones.I just ordered another pair for my Dad. He wears hearing aids and he tried them and loved them. The headphones are so light you don't even know you are wearing them.
R1GD1N4EQULPDM,5,I bought these headphones for my husband.  He is very happy with this purchase and found they are better than many we have owned over the years.
R7HJJJQRRKGKX,5,Got these for a Chistmas gift for my Husband and he loves them.  Always walking around the house with them on his head listen to his shows and now no more dueling TV's.  I used to have to keep turning up my volume to be louder then his.  Well worth the money.
R10DR3KYROPM3S,4,"These headphones are great, and they're backed by an excellent company that knows pro-audio. However, I've experienced a good amount of static (depending on which way I pivot my head) and the fit is less than desirable. They're a bit bulky and will fall off if I look down. But overall, I like them. They've got great sound quality and they allow me to roam around while listening to music or podcasts."
R1NWVDND43FINE,5,I purchased this for my Daughter-in-law for Christmas. My son told me that it was the best gift ever and saved them from a divorce(said in jest) But now she can watch tv late at night without disturbing his sleep. Easy to use and very comfortable on the ears.
R24K4VOJ87V035,4,These wireless headphones are great! They are easy to hook up and charge. The directions never said how long or often to recharge but it does have a feature that says it won't overcharge. The earpads are fairly comfortable - not quite as good as the previous ones I had (different brand)but definitely sufficient.  Great price and VERY good accoustics - sounds like stereo - no static and I could walk downstairs and all around the house and still get great sound.
R114GGUOZZZZTC,4,"Headphones work great.  There is some minor background \\""noise\\"" when nothing is being broadcast but of no consequence when using.  Creates a great \\""surround sound\\"" effect.  Watching TV or a movie late at night can now be done without distrubing others.  Certainly recommend."
R3S0SNPLRLY6TY,5,Wonderful product. You will not be disappointed. Every wife should buy these headsets for their husbands.  The range is great.  The range is a good 30 yards or more.
R3O5GR7JTZC1EN,5,"I've always wanted a set of wireless headphones so that I wouldn't be trailing 20-feet of coiled cord around but didn't want something so cheap that it would ruin the listening. Then I saw the RS-120s on sale at Amazon and decided they seemed like the right quality at the right price. And I'm not disappointed. Like all wireless devices, you have to expect some interference now and then, but I am almost always able to \\""tune\\"" these using a combination of the channel setting, the tuner, the volume on the phones and the volume at the source. The sound is excellent once you hit that sweet spot and not bad when you're just off. Of course, noises generated by your sound source (radio, CD or whatever) will be magnified when they're playing right in your head, and hisses and pops that you wouldn't necessarily notice coming from your loudspeakers become very apparent. So the better the source, the better the sound on these. And it matters where you place the sending unit -- put it too close to an electrical source (certain light bulbs, your amp and so on) might introduce extraneous noise, so move that around a bit to find a quiet spot. The headphones are light, comfortable and fit me well enough (contrary to complaints from some of the one-star reviewers). They are not \\""sound-isolating\\"" -- which is fine, I still want to hear the phone and people's voices if they are talking to me. Several friends who have come by have tried these and all said, \\""I have to get a pair of these!\\"" I certainly recommend these, especially when they come around at under $50."
R12SFXZLPSV5AA,5,"My husband and I needed a pair of wireless headphones to watch movies and tv at night after we put the wee ones to bed. So, after hours of researching, I decided to order these and an extra headset. We LOVE them! A great bang for the buck here! Sound quality is excellent, we can walk all around our house with them, they fit very comfortable on me (little head) and my husband (larger head), I can watch hours of tv and not feel uncomfortable at all. We put the kids to bed, and put our headphones on, snuggle up and watch our movies on the big screen...feels like we are in the movie theater...great buy...no problems and so easy to install and charge. Sweet deal!"
R256EHNM1HBE4P,5,"I bought these headphones for my wife as a Christmas gift. Previously, she had been using another brand of wireless headphones that were not rechargeable.  Replacing batteries was a pain.  With these headphones, the recharging is painless and works flawlessly.  Very simple and convenient.  The headphones are light and very comfortable.  Sound quality is great.  My son has another model of these headphones and is very pleased with them which is why I bought these.    What more can I say?  The price is right and they work great.    Dan"
R35IG260NYULX4,5,I purchased two pairs of the Sennheiser RS120 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle.  The headphones are used for television viewing so I cannot say how well they work when leaving the living room.  They were purchased for my father and my husband.  My husband often wakes up in the wee hours of the morning and watches television.  The headphones are a blessing because they allow him to view and hear the televison without disrupting the rest of the sleeping household.  My father had trouble hearing the televison clearly and the headphones allow him to adjust the volume to his personal needs without having the T.V. volume too loud for everyone else in the room.  The headphones are adjustable and comfortable.  The sound quality is clear. They were easy to set up and use right out of the box (right after I charged the batteries). The sets came with rechargeable batteries and the charging cradle. It's a wonderful product and I would purchase it again.
R10RYSF5RXLYT8,5,I like them a lot they are purifict for me. I got my moneys worth. The only thing I find falth with is I wish they could be a little tighter on my head.
R1L43R57IP5HE7,5,"I was hesitant to buy these but saw all the good reviews, and I'm very happy with them.  I've been burned before by wireless headphones with poor quality.  These are great.  If you want perfect quality with more bass, these probably won't be for you.  You'd be better off spending more or getting wired headphones.  However, these put out plenty of bass for my movies, games, and whatever I'm listening to around the house.  The static isn't an issue unless you get about 70ft from the receiver and are going through walls. At that point the adjustment knob comes in handy to adjust you to a better frequency for the best reception.  They feel good on your head too.  Remember to keep the headset volume level in the middle to high range and the receiver up more to reduce any \\""hiss\\"" sound.      Other than looking like you're a DJ wannabe, they're not bad.  I recommend them for the quality and price.  I can now play loud wargames with these and won't wake up my kid or upset the wife. :)"
R3B4QNH3LDZ3YU,5,My husband would put the volume of our TV so loud that it would destort the sound and make my daugther and I move to another room.  The headphones work great and my husband can even hear the tv when he goes in the kithcen for a snack. He says the sound is great.
R20QX03BGEQT0I,1,"Had obviously been used and returned then sent to me  unrepaired ! I have no way to rate the product as it NEVER WORKED ! I ordered this as a new product and received a broken used one. I am very put out with the hassle! This was also a gift,so my grandson had nothing from me at Christmas!"
R2Y3K69QBUGNAP,4,"Frankly, when I purchased these headphones, I was a little concerned by the comments some other reviewers had made about the \\""hiss\\"" in the background when these headphones were used.  I suggest those reviewers READ THE INSTRUCTIONS that come with these headphones.       I too experienced \\""hiss\\"" when I first put the headphones on, but, with just a little adjustment of the \\""tuning\\"" and \\""volume\\"" controls on the headset, I was able to eliminate the \\""hiss\\"" completely!       I also own a set of Sennheiser 280 wired headphones as well as this set of Sennheiser RS120 wireless ones.  The wireless phones are lighter and a little more comfortable, but the wired set produces better overall audio quality and outside noise isolation.       If you intend to use Headphones to listen to Music, I'd recommend going with good quality WIRED phones.  However, I was just looking for comfortable headphones that would allow me to (silently) watch TV in bed late at night while my wife sleeps, and these RS120's work great for that.  They reproduce TV audio perfectly, are easy to adjust, and reasonably comfortable to wear in bed.  They're just what I wanted."
R1S8UL38M6H6RY,4,"These are great wireless headphones, especially for the price.  They were purchased so that I could watch TV without bothering my wife.  They are great for that and for just listing to music.  The sound quality is absolutely excellent.  While they don't emulate surround sound, the richness of the sound and stereo separation is very good.  I've been all over the house on all three levels and the sound quality remains consistently good.  The sound quality of these headphones compares favorable with wired headphones but there is freedom to move around without the cord.  On rare occasion, you will hear an electrostatic pop in the headphones, but it is not offensive.  The headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods; however they do tend to slip off if you bend your head over when wearing them.  Overall, these are great headphones and I am glad that I made the purchase."
R2JUG4RHL862JH,5,"I bought this set after doing a little research. Decent price for high end headphones. Amazon was the cheapest anywhere for new ones, and free shipping. I got these for my Father, who is hard of hearing, and misses most plots of tv movies because he just can't hear everything. He has a particular problem with background noise.<br /><br />To my great satisfaction, he loves these headphones. He doesn't complain about comfort, and says they're the best thing that's happened to him in a long time. He can finally hear the movies again! His gal likes them too, since she doesn't have to hear his TV at full blast any more.<br /><br />She can play the tv at whatever volume she wants, or muted, while he plays the headphones at whatever level he wants. I tried walking thru my entire house with them, and they were clear as a bell everywhere in the house. They run off AAA rechargeables, so battery replacement is no concern, and they seem to not run the batterys down fast. Just the same, I went ahead and bought him some Duracell rechargeables and charger for them, so he has spares just in case they die in the middle of a movie or something. I was really impressed with how well they work.<br /><br />I read reviews from others that grumbled about some small details like volume knob placement and all, but I don't see anything about these that isn't very liveable. Once they're on your head and set, you don't have to mess with anything else anyway. In short, I highly recommend these!"
R3F798BF6M5X3G,1,"I bought this for my husband for the holidays. I was so excited. It turned on for about 5 minutes then went fuzzy/dead/snow. The 'on' light never came back on. We returned it for another. The next one came. The light stayed on, but when it would get tuned in the sound quality was so aweful, you could hardly hear the words for the low deep buzzing in your ears. AND you could not turn the volume on the TV down with out loosing all the sound in the headset. Sad - we are awaiting our complete refund.    Amazon has been great through the first return, and we expect the same for the second, but the item iteslf is not worth the time in my opinion."
R2DTR29RVGVPPE,5,I have to admit I was pretty reluctant to try this but it has definitly made a difference in being able to hear without blasting everyone out of the room.  I can actually hear the voices now over much of the background noise and music that tends to drown out voices in so many shows and movies anymore
R21UGA4IVBJ37,4,"This is the second set of wireless headphones I've owned. First was JVC. Sound is good -- I use it exclusively with TV so as not to disturb sleeping family members, so not sure if it would be audiophile quality with a high quality source. Seems well constructed, very comfortable to wear for extended periods. Charging cradle is great. Just set it on rack and little worry about whether the contacts are lined up or properly positioned."
R26JJKXP03RNDT,5,"I got these great headphones on Black Friday after Thanksgiving, so I got a great deal on them.  I love the fact it has it's own charging station and it recharges pretty quickly.  The sound is awesome, it even comes with an auto-tune to pick up proper waves when I'm moving around.    Great Headphones."
R11HVQM6M8YDI1,4,My wife uses to watch TV without her hearing aids and without turning the volume up.  Only problem is she can't hear me talk to her.
R18Y9NVA9GN0IP,5,"I purchased these as a Christmas gift after checking out Sony and a couple others.  Sennheiser has a strong reputation and the price was great.  They were simple to set up and the sound is clear and full.  The range is also excellent.  My wife uses them to watch TV while she is on her exercize equipment.  They are comfortable for her and she is very happy with them.  Although Sony is also a great brand, the price on Amazon and reputation of Sennheiser caused me to make the right decision.  We are very pleased with these wireless headphones."
REAALS7K43KR,3,"I got this to use during working out on an elliptical machine so I could watch TV without disturbing the rest of the house.  It works but the sound quality is less than what I had expected.  Could be that wireless is just not as good as \\""wired\\""."
R1K7LF3MQY4MSD,5,This is my second set of headphones/charger. This one is superior to my Sony. Range is better. Sound quality is better. Headphones set on charger more conveniently.
R2FCW9EUX5G568,5,I couldn't be happier.  This allows me to manuver around my office and being cordless is great.
RK32I5XPL14RI,5,"Excellent product, bought it for a gift for my husband and he is  very happy.    really easy to use and set up"
RJMP8GHZ91Q0X,3,"We've been using wireless headphones to watch TV and movies for over ten years and the Sennheiser RS120 are very good -- just not as good as we had hoped for.      The sound quality is the best feature and generally remains clear and strong, even outside.  The cups around the ears are small but fairly comfortable since they don't press.      Unfortunately, our issues are ones we've not previously encountered with other wireless phones.  Most problematic is the design of the band over your head.  While it's comfortable, the plastic tends to bend and not maintain it's shape, making it sometimes difficult to place on the charging cradle and charge the unit.  Also, there's no light on the headphones to let you know they're on, which means when they're not on the cradle, you have to physically pick them up to check to see if they're on.  Lastly, if a wireless house phone is in use within twenty feet or so, the unit picks up interference and sometimes even the conversation.           All in all, a good product for the price but a bit of a disappointment, considering the quality of the Sennheiser brand."
R3W522FKZZALQ1,4,"I am very pleased with my headphones.  There is a *slight* hum when there is no other sound, but it doesn't interfere with my listening.  I use it for the TV, because I have trouble hearing dialog.  If I turn up the TV so I can hear, my wife complains it's too loud.  I also like them for being able to watch TV if my wife goes to bed early or wants to listen to the stereo."
RCR9TLD891UJ8,5,"I replaced a previous wireless headset with RE120 beacuse the previous would cut out intermittingly, probably due to a poor connection within the headset. I would bang on them and the would start up again. The Sennheiser RS120 seems well made, worked well right out of the box, sound very good and block out background  talking and noise well.  They are comfortable to wear and I forget they are on.  Very high rating so far!"
R2WFT9P76LLQVD,5,"This is an amazing product, well worth the price. I have not full tested it yet, however I do know that the sound quality does not degrade up to 40ft through multiple walls! I'm willing to bet that it'll work at a distance of 60ft. They are comfortable to wear, and the charging station works great. Highly recommended!"
R1CC0T5L11NQ9O,5,"I bought these wireless headphones for my mother. Prior to doing a bit of research online, I didn't even know they existed.     I was apprehensive about purchasing this type of electronic equipment online but I read positive reviews. When I received them, they were exactly as I had expected. Reviews said that the headphones were flimsy; I do not agree that they are flimsy but they are made for heads of all shapes and sizes, which means they don't fit perfectly on my head. Sound quality makes up for it, though.    My mother and I had a bit of trouble figuring out exactly how to use them -- there are no specific instructions in the box, per say, but there are pictures and information on what to use them for. We're pretty tech savvy so we were able to figure it out.     The sound quality for movies and music (through Sirius and satellite) is AMAZING. We still cannot get them to work as perfectly with normal FM, but we mainly use them to listen to CDs or DVDs."
REBCN72EHB3H8,5,"I ordered these for my Dad who was having trouble hearing the TV and can't really afford a hearing aid.  He also has sensitive ears.  He loves them and has been happily using them all the time.  He sent the other kind, that hangs below the chin right back.  So I know he's happy with his headphones.  He has recommended them to a cousin with similar hearing issues who even has a hearing aid!  Both thumbs up for sure!"
R2ABMHJ9LW1JQ4,2,"I regret having bought this product.    The first big problem is the auto-shut-off feature.  One of the prominent positive reviews for this product comes from someone who says this isn't a big deal, and it may not happen to be an issue for them, but it's a huge deal for me and other reviewers.    If whatever you're listening to (a youtube video, for example) ends and no sound is being played, the transmitter shuts off and you suddenly get loud static in your ears.  If the headphones are sitting on your desk for some reason (somebody comes to talk to you and you take them off) when the shut-off happens, the hissing coming from the headphones is loud enough to annoy anyone nearby.    The other problem is that you often don't get a clean sound.  You can dial in the frequency as carefully as possible but still get bits of distortion and static when you tip or swing your head.  If you're doing anything else while listening to music, this is a real downside.    I would strongly recommend passing on these and looking at a digital alternative that has no auto-shut-off feature."
R12MEJGE86UTCI,4,"First, the faults: These are not studio or \\""audiophile\\"" quality headphones. If your expectation is immaculate sound reproduction, these are not for you. They have trouble reproducing heavy bass without distortion, and even in close proximity to the transmitter the headphones typically have a very slight hiss, which is (to my ears) not noticeable while music is playing, but is faintly audible between tracks. A rabid audiophile would be horrified, but I rarely notice it. Also, if you plan to listen while moving about a great deal, you may notice occasional moments of louder hiss or static, as the orientation of the headphones with respect to the transmitter changes, much the way a change in the orientation of old \\""rabbit ears\\"" television antennas could cause reception to fade.     Now the good part: Despite the faults, I find these headphones to be quite usable, and in fact, I use them often. This is partly a matter of expectation and experience: I know their limitations, and have learned either to prevent or accept their flaws without expecting more than they're capable of, in return for the benefits they give me. The primary benefit of any wireless headphones, as I see it, is the freedom of not having to be in the same room as the music source I'm listening to. I can get comfortable and enjoy the music anywhere in the house, without having to put it on speakers that might disturb others (especially late at night). I occasionally use them while up and active (as while cooking in the kitchen), and I'm willing to tolerate an occasional second or so of slight static during a song if I turn to a different position, or a bit of signal loss if I stand in front of the refrigerator (which partially blocks the signal). During times when it would be bothersome to others if I had open speakers playing (thus disturbing someone's TV watching, or sleep), I can recline in a chair and enjoy my music very well. I still use wired headphones when it's convenient to get comfortable in the same room as the music source, and good wired phones do sound better than wireless. But the convenience factor, for me, more than outweighs the (relatively minor) aural defects of these headphones.    Some tips for those who want to use these wireless headphones:    - I find that I can minimize the background static (i.e. make it inaudible during the music and barely noticeable between tracks) if I set the volume on the source to maximum, ensuring a good signal to the transmitter, and then adjust the listening volume with the control on the headphones themselves.    - When you first get them, it may take a little time experimenting with different transmission channels and fine-tuning to find the best signal quality for your environment. Like any wireless device these headphones are subject to interference. Try each channel (there are three) on the transmitter, and then carefully adjust the tuning on the headphones to get the best signal, then move to different areas of your house to see how the quality may be affected. It took me perhaps an hour of trial-and-error to find the tuning that works best for me.    - Turn down the bass a little at your music source. As mentioned above, heavy bass will distort in the phones; feeding less bass to the transmitter will make a big difference in the overall sound quality. And with the smaller speakers pressed directly to your ears, you'll need less bass than you get from a big, thumping subwoofer anyway.    If the low cost of these wireless headphones and the convenience of using them anywhere outweighs your desire for perfect audio quality, these should do the job. But if you simply cannot abide any loss of fidelity for any reason, under any circumstances, I wouldn't recommend them; stick with high-quality wired phones."
R85HLROTK3DCJ,1,"I just mailed this product back to Amazon.  It does not work anything like advertised.  White noise all the time, losing the frequency connection to the TV, TV still has to be turned way up or you can't hear anything in the headsets which defeats the purpose of using them.  Don't buy this."
R2MS3ZN9FEVAJN,1,"I have never been as disappointed as I was when I got these Sennheiser RS120 and found how sweet they were for the first 20 minutes or so then  then came the noise. I have been testing them over the last two weeks  using various sources like TV, Movies and CD's and find that the noise  appears after some 5 to 20 minutes. Now I have the Sennheiser RS100 I  have enjoyed for over 3 years and never had any noise or other problem  with them. I have worked in communication for 38 years and have the   qualifications to judge. Sound has been my hobby for most of my life  and my house is full of electronics. I first tried these connected to  the output of my DVD player downstairs and then thinking well maybe  the audio signal is not clean or not the right level so I will move  it to upstairs and connect it to the output of a $1200 Denon A/V receiver tape out jack which I know to good as it where I have my RS100 without  noise ever.  The noise appears on the RS120 just like it did on the downstairs unit.  Conclusion...This RS120 is garbage ...  Must a knock off ... I will order one from Crutchfield since I notice  there is not one complaint of noise on the reviews from those who have  bought from them and that should tell you something. Sennheiser is a  top notch company with excellent products. Hope this helps many."
RG6YVYBKU7EQ7,4,"My review of these headphones is a little mixed and different than the average user. You see; I bought these mainly to use playing my electric guitar through my multi-effects pedal.   So first off, for playing guitar they are not perfect, if you use alot of distortion and heavy palm muting the volume seems to drop some; almost like smart sound trying to adjust itself, but its tolerable.  Now for stereo music listening I think they are excellent, they have plenty of bass, very clear stereo sound and I can walk around the whole house doing stuff and even go out side and they work fine. They are also very comfortable for headphones and light weight."
R1A6PYKL60VSTC,5,"You say you want quiet and he/she wants to watch tv or listen to music?  This is your product. The sound quality is great and so is the distance that you can travel with them on, never missing anything, unless you want to.  The price was great compared to other like products."
R25UZT43R45569,3,"I purchased this about one year ago, it had awesome range walking around the house late at night! I kinda felt like \\""Princess Leia\\"" but I these were my first wireless headphones. Sadly after long nights and alot of use, on January 2, 2009 they stopped working. I tried changing the batteries but to no avail. I will miss them and await the moment I can afford to buy another set! Rest in peace my friend!"
R3LEAO24DNX6K6,3,"bought this one based on numerous reviews. I first hook it up with my receiver, no good at all, the sound is either very muffed or too much static noise; on the verge of returning it, I hook it up directly with TV, good enough for me to keep it.    the bad? I actually expected a bit better build quality, but this headset feels cheap - the headset is getting so loose that it will fall off whenever I duck my head - in only one or two weeks, that is no good. but I am keeping it - since I figure 90% of the time, I will sit still."
R5PM59FSTXOH5,5,"These headphones have exceeded my expectations.  I got them for $49, so my expectations were somewhat modest.  (I see they're priced at $67 now... Go figure...)    I am using the red/black RCA connectors rather than the headphone jack.  I'm not sure why they are red/black when everyone else uses red/white.  I have the RCA connectors hooked up to the back of a TiVo.  The auto on/off works flawlessly.  When I put the TiVo in standby, the base turns off.  When I turn the TiVo back on, the base turns back on.   I have not encountered any of the periodic automatic shutoffs that other users have complained about.    There is a small amount of hiss.  You will only notice this during quiet moments in the audio if you have the volume up.  Additionally, if you move further away from the base, you'll get more hiss.  I am mostly using it about 10 feet from the base, and there is very little hiss.    For the $49, I am very satisfied with this product."
RS5MUG2JMJZYK,4,"I've used this product for a little time, I can tell that if you are near the transmitter it works very nice.  To me they sound very good they give good bass and also highs are clear, so I have no complains regarding how they sound.  If you get farther away from the transmiter then there is a hiss, my house has concrete walls so range is not that long, for example I'm barely 4 meters from the source when I'm at the computer but I have to concrete walls in between so reception isn't good to the point that I have to move the transmitter to the same room to get good reception while working on the computer."
RP2YS9VG4SQGR,5,These really sound great. I use them when walking on the treadmill because the TV would be hard to hear.  They really sound like surround sound and when you watch nature programs it is amazing the detailed sounds you can hear. Also Amazon price was about $30-40 cheaper the same item from others.
R2GU54KZNSQCZZ,3,"If you need wireless headphones that will work all over the house, then these are acceptable. However, these suffer the same drawback all other RF devices. The audio is never completely clear, there will be an undercurrent of background static.    I would recommend these for scenarios where you can't have line of site to the receiver and audio quality isn't paramount."
R319YU3RKKYO6K,4,"I bought these headphones to play my ps3 and not disturb my girldfriend from her reading. I am happy with them no doubt, but I don't know if it;s just mine but when a game is loading or when there is nothing to hear on the screen the signal i get from the base sends out a high pitch noise but a a low level. Once the shooting starts or the music or any game the sounds drown out the pitch but it still there if you pause or whatever.  It might not bother you but it bothers me. Other than that it's pretty sturdy, great response, mid bass i would say, and best of all it has rechargeable batteries! you have to charge them like 30 hours before first use."
R3CQ1DV4L1N803,4,"I am very pleased with the functionality of this product. The only drawback that I have found is that the connection from sound source to the recharger is a permanent one. I use the headset for both TV and DVD listening and have to change the source connection. With my previous head set I was able to have separate connectors for each source. Changing sources is a bit more difficult with the permanent connection to the charger. Otherwise, I am very pleased with the sound quality and comfort."
R13N54DXCFI8D,5,these headphones are the greatest! bought 2 of them. the sound quality is stereo and its nice to charge them by just laying them on the bars. don't have to worry about getting it just right. plus theres a light that tells u if they are charging.
RRDK9EJW3GYMB,5,I walk around my 1/4 acre and can hear everything. Controls work well and charger is not a problem.. Solved my initial problem of aircraft noise.
R1LRD2D84LKQ0I,1,"It was difficult to hook up as no clear instructions.   When I finally got it hooked up, it did not work.   I returned it for credit.   My brother has two said that they work great for him and he recommended them.  Just could be me.  I am not a electronics person."
R765I6FEGXQCI,2,"They are comfortable, easy to use and recharge.   I hear a hiss, unless you turn them up loud.  I have also noticed interference, with reception,when I move my arm up.  The tuning I find also difficult. being too sentive.  My husband, who has hearing problems, doesn't notice the hissing, and since they were purchased for him so I can sleep while he watches TV, they do the necessary job."
R2KCWZQ0RJF9IV,4,I bought this headphone for my husband as a X-Mas gift.  He loves it the sound quality is very good and very comfortable to wear
R29CBSEMU4YR94,5,"I bought these headphones for my Dad's birthday. Now he can watch games and movies after my mom wants to go to sleep without bothering her. Days after they arrived to their house, she told me how wonderful they are. To me, that's the best review. :)"
R3KSKE2VQ9W8LM,3,Noice wise it's OK in general. The volumes at both ears are not equivalent. In other words the tuning of earhone gets different result between two ears.
R22OOAXS5O49OM,5,This product was fully as represented. It arrived in brand new condition. The sound quality & wireless performance was superb.
RWV4JLO84YW33,5,Great gift for my husband and myself too.  He can sit up and watch TV while I sleep.  Works great.
R3KMBJWO8GJHYU,4,"Love the rechargeable batteries, and the noise cancellation.  I cannot hear anything else when I have them on, and cannot hear a thing coming from the headphones when my fiance is playing video games.  Worth it at this great price."
RAFK9GXX68178,5,my husband can finally hear what we hear with these headphones on.  Jokes on tv shows do not get missed because he can't hear the punch line and we don't have to  crank the volume up.  My favorite part is that he can mute the tv so I can sleep and he can still watch his show with the headphones on.  This is actually our second set. I bought a pair last year and loved them so much that we bought another for other tv's in the house.
R2270YSHNLSQ4L,5,"Santa brought this headphone set for my husband who claims, \\""It's not that I can't HEAR what they're saying. I just can't UNDERSTAND it.\\"" This seems to be a typical complaint when older folks begin losing hearing, and combined with the increasingly LOUD background music and sound effects in today's productions, an extra volume boost by headphones is a real help.<br /><br />When hubby first began using them, he was annoyed because they kept cutting off after just a short time. But here's the secret... Set your volume at a normal level then MUTE the sound source. By only lowering the volume setting, the Sennheiser RS120 thinks it isn't in use and automatically shuts off, as it is designed to do.<br /><br />It is so nice for him to be able to hear sound and dialog without blasting the pictures off the wall and deafening everyone else in the house!<br /><br />I don't have a hearing problem and these headphones produce awesome sound, not only for TV, but good music as well. They seem to cancel ambient noise pretty well and you can kick back and float off into your own place listening to your favorite tunes. In fact, I think I'll put a set of these on MY Christmas list next year - if I can wait that long!"
R3LPBJJISY7J02,5,I really enjoy using these headphones. The sound is very clear -- no crackling like my old Sony headphones had. I also like the convenience of the on/off switch. The design makes them very comfortable to wear and easily adjustable.
R2R11IJ2DSWL1V,5,WOW! once you get everything connected it is like being at the movies each time you put the headset on. The sound is all that!!!!...trust we you will enjoy blocking out the noise and going to another level of listening.
REKDTFNAO0XX7,5,This is a great wireless headphone. Perfect for listening to music and watching TV from a distance. No wires to get in the way. The sound quality is very good for the price.
R192ZMMHBOGUUE,4,"These Sennheiser wireless headphones perform very well.  They performed exactly as promised.  Sound was excellent. One caveat - they used on-the-ear earpieces that I found somewhat uncomfortable.  A better choice might have been the model that used over-the-ear earpieces. Slightly more expensive, but in the long run, might be worthwhile for those who use the headset for extended periods of time."
R2YEIBF6AMAOID,3,"These headphones are a gift to womankind everywhere! Had to have been invented by a woman whose man constantly watches TV. Peace and quiet! Hubby adores these! He said the sound quality is fantastic, NO static, he can move from room to room without losing signal and they are very comfortable to wear. Best Christmas gift I ever got him! High quality, great design, LONG battery life!"
R24GW26OQHY6FF,5,"I originally ordered this product from another electronics firm at the cost of $100.  The cost from Amazon was about 40^ less, is very dependable,as well as effective for those of us that are hearing impared.  It has real sound seperation almost to the point of surround sound, and can even hear the tv when I'm in another room.  As a result of trying mine, three more friends ordered the same product from Amazon.  Jim Boyd"
R11RAYXM5OO80K,5,Sennheiser RS120 MHz RF headphones w/charging cradle. Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It is a First Class headphone set. He loves it and we have not had any problems with this product.  Thank you.
RJHXH6JMLZQ75,5,I received a set of these headphones for Christmas.  They are fantastic.  The only complaint I could possibly have is that they do become a little cumbersome to wear after a long movie or ball game.  Otherwise I love them.  I can't thank my sister-in-law enough for a great Christmas.
RQ5888IXQT8FT,5,"These headphones are very simple to connect to the television and other than the 24 hour wait to charge the batteries, the listener is ready to go.  I was very happy to find that I could use the headphones with the television muted (totally no sound).  I wish I had bought them years ago!"
R19R095BF7UQKT,5,"I bought these for my Dad for his birthday.  My parents have two Tv's within Earshot, so he has been watching with the sound off and closed captioning on.  With these he can have sound again without conflict.  They are very simple to set up, easy to use and they sound good."
RDMACL7EMKDMD,5,"I bought the headphones last month.  I originally had bought a wireless set from Sony, but I returned them due to awful sound and a lot of interference.  Probably this was due to my wireless network as both were on the 2.4GHz frequence.  That is why I wanted something with a different frequence, and the RS120 operate on the 926MHz.  What a difference !  Excellent sound, very clear, great reception and no interference.  On the comfort side, I guess they could be better but for the price I think is is a great buy overall.  Make sure to turn up the volume high enough of your TV when trying the first time, so the headphones can detect the sound signal."
R5B0FNHIQETYL,5,"I initially ordered our first set of these headphones in 2005 because we had a new baby and I wanted to watch t.v. The headphones were much more expensive back then but they were worth the price! Our first pair is still in use and we have had no problems with them or the rechargable battery. Since my husband and I like watching some t.v. and movies together without disturbing our kids, we purchased a second set and hooked the extra base to another t.v. (each t.v. was linked to a different \\""channel\\"" so we could each watch something at the same time). I love these so much - I purchased a third set so I could walk on my treadmill and watch t.v. I wouldn't recommend these for a serious \\""sweaty\\"" workout, but if you are just walking on a treadmill - they work great. My treadmill is loud so it really helps that I don't have to turn the volume up on the t.v. anymore. We have had absolutely no problems with any of the sets - except for the fact that I dropped our fist set down some stairs and on the floor etc - but they STILL work after all of that abuse. There sometimes is a little interference when we have our lights \\""dim\\"" (we have a dimmer switch) and that set is hooked to a really old receiver. Our set that is hooked directly to our newer t.v. has absolutely no problems - it is crystal clear."
R39XR2PSQBEM8Y,5,"Headphones are great, once my ears stopped bleeding.  If the source (laptop in my case) is turned low and you adjust the headphone volume high enough to compensate, the static that occurs when the signal stops is deafening.  Just make sure the source is turned as high as it will go, and be aware of this...  Headphones sound great."
RWUYFAEVJTCSH,5,"Its a very good product and i would recommend it for others. I am currently using it with my TV. I have tested it from about 25ft with walls in between no disturbance in noise level or clarity.   No issues with charging, working good so far."
R1CRY9IZCLYG4C,1,"I love my RS 140's, but the RS 120's are totally unwearable.  You need a pretty large head for these to fit snugly, and there's no way to adjust them.  So, I'd advise trying them on somewhere before buying, especially if you're buying for someone with a smaller head.  They're just made of thin foam wrapped around the speaker - nothing anywhere near as comfortable or form-fitting as the RS140s."
R3HNDGVPWTURT4,2,"When I FINALLY was able to set these up, they seem to work well.  The instruction sheet was awful!! Step one - establish necessary connections. OK, and those would be????  There should be a description and picture of each component - I'm clearly technically challenged, but it would have saved me some time to dig out the power supply for the transmitter had I known it was in the box!  The charging cradle feature is great, had it been explained more clearly.  Set up shows only to connect to audio out.  I know there are several devices you can use these with, stereo, TV, PC, etc.  Would it be too much to ask to show some set up options, say with a home theater system, or to mention that you may have to turn your TV audio down so you only hear through the headphones?  My initial impression of sound, range etc is good, but honestly I'm too frazzled from the frustration of setting these up with useless instructions!"
RVHY6DK98P0AN,5,"I bought this headphone based on the reviews here, and I was not disappointed!  They fit comfortably, were a snap to setup to my brand new Panasonic 42\\"" Plasma TV and so far I have no complaints.  They sound great with no noticeble static or unwanted noise.  I like the on off switch on the headphones and the volume control is more than adequate."
R1O3PKC3IXXAG6,1,"Original review below. Now it is 2012 and these quit working about 9 months after I bought them!!!!!! Took them in for repair (costly, too!), but they could not be fixed where they would work decently with any TV we have. They just would not hold a charge. Started out OK for an hour or 2, but got worse and worse, down to 15 minutes by the time I threw them away!!!! Maybe I had a dud set, but I would not want to purchase this brand again.  Old review:  Wow, this headset is wonderful compared to what I was expecting! Last time I used a wireless headset from Radio Shack many years ago, I got so frustrated with the static, reception cutting in and out and poor overall sound quality. I love to watch TV in bed, but hubby can't sleep so I decided to try wireless again. These are amazing. Was originally going for some Sonys at $59.00, but read and compared reviews and opted to spend a few more bucks and see if the Sennheisers were as good as promised. You won't be disappointed in either the quality of the sound or the distance you can hear clearly away from the base unit. I can walk all over the house, indoors and out on the patio, and can hear every word. The headset is a bit big, but not uncomfortable, and is fine lolling in bed or a recliner and not having to move about much. Controls are a little tricky to manage without taking off the headset (as I had read in a review) but once set, I can forget about them. Nice long viewing time between charges. I also love that I can set the TV for me to hear, let my Mom use the earphones as loud as she wishes and we don't bother each other by her not being able to hear and me not being able to tolerate the loud volume she needs. Really glad I got these!!!!"
RUDMJPY36VQ1O,5,No more captions on the bottom of the screen of our TV so I can hear what is being said! I can simply enjoy all my favorite shows without turning the sound up for anybody else. The soundtracks are awesome and the background music terrific. It may become slightly cumbersome for anyone watching TV for more than 3 hours. As for me I'm highly satisfied with the product and recommended for anyone with lightly impaired hearing.
R336T855G3WEJJ,4,"This works most of the time.  Some interference, but for the price it works"
R2RAN8LYWR97BZ,4,"I bought these for my husband, who turns up the TV so loud in the bedroom I can't sleep. When I got the headphones, I hooked them up to the audio out on the back of my 52\\"" TV. The sound was very low, the headset kept cutting off in 5 or 10 minutes and there was also alot of hissing. I tried the other outputs, but nothing. I was ready to return them when I looked on the back of all the other equipment hooked up to this TV. Then my AH-HA moment. Since our TIVO is connected to this TV and we use the TIVO remote, I plugged the jacks into the audio out on the back of TIVO. BAM! perfect sound, little or no hissing and I can cut the sound all the way down on the TV and it does not affect the headset at all. He can turn them up as loud as he wants. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a goodnights sleep, they're GREAT.  THANKS! It was worth the frustration...  SLEEPING IN ALABAMA"
R1U8RH2PJPQF0M,5,"I work late in my home office.  I was looking for a wireless headphone/ear bud alternative that would allow me to listen to music on my computer while I work without disturbing the family.  I researched several Sony models but, in the end, decided on the Sennheiser based on the good reviews.  I made the correct choice.<br /><br />This headphone set works great.  I use it primarily on my computer.  It allows me an untethered connection to my music collection that is even better than I imagined.  I'm able to move around the entire house without so much as a \\""hiccup\\"" in the sound. It has no noticeable hiss.  The highs and lows are very clear and very distinct.<br /><br />The headphones are very easy to connect/disconnect.  So, I now find myself using them in more places that just the home office.  I'm able to easily move them to the den or the bedroom and use them for movie watching or listening to my stereo.<br /><br />If you want a quality headphone set that will free you from cords, the Sennheiser RS120 is the one you want!"
R1N5GDCJXUDRTH,5,"I bought these for my husband, to replace the third set of wireless headphones he has owned over a 10 year span.  Being used to the benefits of the rechargable wireless headphones, this review is all about quality and superiority.<br /><br />He normally has had to have the volume turned up high for the signals to get through without reverting to static.  Not with this model.  This picks up the signal easily and from room to room.<br /><br />He's able to hear the Sunday morning 'talking heads', with the voices all clear and separated.  Even hears the stage background noises (is that good??).  Even the commercials are distinctly heard.<br /><br />I'm sure he'll get a thrill from the NFL games, even if his team sucks.  As for me, I'm glad I don't have to listen to the announcers!<br /><br />Overall, the quality & the looks are great!  I recommend rechargeable wireless headphones in general, and the Sennheiser RS120 926 in particular!"
R2KP3K74BA39VM,1,Save your money.  These are useless.  I bought them for my husband so he could watch TV and I could have peace and quiet.  The only work for a minute or 2 and then the static starts.  Unplugging and replugging them gets them working for another minute or 2 and then the static comes back.  Don't bother with these!!
R2U0JGSPIQG6HL,4,I just want to say that Amazon.com is a class act.  I will continue to shop on Amazon's site.
R3P6D0E7HJMCIC,2,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]Since I have hearing problems I was excited about getting these hooked up to TV and be able to watch movies without CC.  I was very dissapointed.  They would work sporadically and hiss a lot.  To me the flat ear pad was unconfortable.  Perhaps I should have ordered the 140's.
R1Z7OQ3VOQUS0F,1,"I got these for Christmas (yesterday) and talk about bad - these things are horrible. There is constant static in the background and if there is no sound for only a few seconds, the system shuts down. Take my word on this - just say no!"
R1PD8NL4GSRZ3Y,5,"These headphones are great.  I bought them so I could watch (and hear) TV while using my treadmill.  As soon as I found out how well that worked, I started using them while doing other things around the house that make a lot of noise.  It's great that the range is good so although I have the cradle connected to a TV downstairs, I can use them while I watch a TV upstairs.  I am so happy with these headphones.  This certainly isn't a technical review, but as an everyday user, I can recommend them without any reservation."
R33WED83S2CQ2C,5,"I purchased these headphones for my brother-in-law who lives with us.  He is severely hearing impaired and was blasting the family out of the room when we watch TV.  He likes these headphones so so much.  He wears them everyday to watch TV or to listen to the cable music channel.  He can go out into the backyard and has no problem with reception.  The volume is adjustable on the phones themselves and is plenty loud for him.  I have it hooked into the cable box so that the TV volume has no effect on them.  The rechargeing is great and they seem to keep there charge for at least 6 to 8 hours.  They are comfortable too, he falls asleep in them sometimes.  I am going to purchase another pair for my dad today!"
R2XTRR06K9HMS9,4,"The headset is easy to set up and easy to use.  Good clear sound.  Not a high end feel to the headset itself, but very functional."
R1MZXI8MCTMRSM,5,"The good: no cords to easily get tangled. There is a cord, of course, from the base to the device you want to listen to. In this case, my dad's computer. He uses Skype to call relatives overseas and bother me every week about something else and he had problems with another set of corded sennheisers that I got for him. The cord, no matter how hard he tried, got tangled into an unholy mess. After about a year of untangling it for him whenever I went to visit, I said forget it, looked up wireless headphones, and was pleased to see that Sennheiser had a few options. I love sennheiser quality and I use a set of sennheiser gaming headphones with a mic for skype and gaming so of course I'm already a fan. The corded set went to my mom for when she uses skype and mysteriously the cords stay untangled.<br /><br />Back to the wireless set though, the price was solid but I think I got it off newegg for slightly cheaper and they had a free shipping promotion at the time, so it was quicker than Amazon's USPS (Newegg uses 3-day UPS guaranteed shipping, but it's not always free). The main complaints that had me worried were: 1) slight buzzing noises when there is no sound coming out, as in when a movie goes quiet or a song is fading out. 2) the frequency changer is right by the volume changer, so it's easy to accidentally change it. 3) Very poor range<br /><br />I didn't notice the slight buzzing noise during silent parts of a movie or quiet parts of a song. I haven't used them as much as my dad has, though, and he still has no complaints. Range is about 1 foot since he's sitting at his computer when he uses them, so again, I can't say I've tested them to their max. As for the poor design of the frequency changer and the volume changer, well a piece of tape over the former will do just fine. I set the frequency on the base, adjusted with the knob on the headphones, and then stuck a piece of tape over it. I just know that dad will mess with it accidentally and so far, he's had no problems there either. He loves the headphones for skype and when mom tells him she can hear his music or movies, so it's a great deal. Rechargeable base makes this an even better deal, he never has to worry about changing the batteries (Which would worry me a great deal, he's not tech-savvy). Over all, I'd say it's a must have if you've got the right set of conditions. I can't speak for plugging into a TV because that could run into the problem of poor range. Sound quality is what I expect from Sennheiser and just as a point of comparison, most higher end models run well into the $300-400 range. No. Thank. You.<br /><br />When you buy from Sennheiser, you can expect high quality and this doesn't disappoint.her.

RQJUBE0U07IAT,3,I've used these for a few weeks now and I have to say that I wasn't impressed. These work all right with TV but the sound is not too great. With music these sound pretty bad compared to any wired ones.    The interference easily happens with these headphones and static is also pretty commonly heard over them. Battery life is decent.
RCL6TS2FWLGKB,2,"The Sennheiser RS120 was my first wireless headphone and probably will be the last one as well. After having tripped, tangled, snapped and spilled stuff with my wired headphones so far, I thought a wireless headphone would be my savior. But the static in these things is just unbearable. It's not that there's a lot of it, but when you keep hearing that sharp crackle every minute or so, you tend to get a headache after a while. And nothing really helps it - tried different channels, different placements, different angles, just doesn't work. You might say the Sennheiser ones are the better ones compared to other wireless ones, but after my experience I think my cheap in ear headphones are a lot better than these."
RFW98AU96DUAR,5,I purchased these mainly for my wife who is a night owl and tend to watch TV in bed while I'm trying to sleep. She has been very pleased with them.  When I've used them I've been very impressed with the comfort and sound quality though I'm by no means an audiophile. The coolest thing is the charging stand - just plop the headphones on and they start charging.  No alignment problems to worry about. Overall I am very pleased with these and would highly recommend them.
RR0SCXL5HY326,5,"I have been sleeping with a TV on since I was a kid and it has never been a problem until a couple of months ago when I got married.  For the past couple of months the tv has been keeping my wife up and really making life difficult \\""hence wife not sleeping well\\"".  I got these headphones a week ago and my wife has slept great she cant hear a thing.  The headphones themselves plugged right into the back of the DVR so the volume can be off on the TV and the sound from the headphones is as loud or quiet as I want it.  The transmitter can be hung on the wall and the rechargeable head phones sit right on top and charge just by sitting on it.  They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever warn really light and they sit on your head instead of claming on like most head phones, I forget they are on most of the time.  The sound is clear even when I walk around the house.  The hissing problem I've read about in one review has more to do with the house then the headphones but I've never heard it.  For the price there are a steal, some would say even a marriage saver."
R2IG2MVBJPCLOG,4,"Good headphones overall. Great battery life. Hissing is not a major problem. The auto shutoff can be a little tricky (just don't hit the mute button on your TV or the headphones will shut off. Once you unmute the TV, it takes a second for the headphones to receive signal again, and sometimes you will get a lot of loud static.). These work great for family members with poor hearing. They won't ask you \\""what?\\"" or something else when you are watching something. Great sound quality to. Very lightweight, and comfortable. Seem to be the best from what I can glean from reviews."
R15YFRMFMTVPI9,1,"The sound quality is actually pretty good.  However, I'm only getting sound on the left channel, so I'm sending this back.  I tried it on my TV and stereo system, and had same problem with both systems.  When I tried a wired headphone, heard sound from both channels, so it's pretty clear my TV and stereo are working fine."
R6RX2WW6UGU22,5,I bought these refurbished and they look and seem brand new only less expensive. I would recommend this product to anyone. They are not the most expensive nor are they the cheapest but the quality is exceptional. I once owned a cheap pair of cordless headphones and these are much much better.  I put these on and can walk outside and not miss anything while fetching my dog from the back yard. I love them!
R2WYLSJ6SICLU9,4,"I just recieved these for Christmas from a friend and loved them. The sound quality is great and the batteries seem to work for about 10 to 12 hours before needing to be recharged. The headphones come with rechargable batteries so you don't need to buy any. The reason I gave these headphones only 4 stars is because as another reviewer mentioned they do tend to fall off if you bend over to pick up anything from the floor. Also, you can only connect one thing at a time to the base such as a TV or computer etc... I imagine one can buy something that can split the audio signal to the base in order to hook it up simultaneously to something else but that would require more money and time and perhaps a bit of trial and error. Otherwise, a great pair of wireless headphones."
R1YOX7Q8O7EDW1,4,"It works pretty well, but the battery doesn't last as long as it should.  If not used, it holds the charge pretty well.  I would recommend it!"
R1I3VY9HQFSYGI,4,"I have always liked the products from this company. The last pair of headphones I bought from them lasted 25 years before literally falling apart. These wireless headphones deliver all the features that are advertised. I can walk everywhere in the house and still hear the audio perfectly. The only complaint I have is that they are not as light-weight as I would prefer. But I imagine that they are not ultra light because of the nature of wireless technology. Overall, they are a good product."
R1RZB526STYSPK,5,"This may have been the easiest, most impressive, most pleasurable start up to a product I have ever had.  I had read many reviews (posted here)  about these headphones: some seemed too good to be true. Some were slightly negative. So, I had my doubts.    I literally opened the box, selected from the included audio jacks for my stereo, inserted the batteries, charged them overnight, and started using the headphones the next morning.  I did not even adjust the tuning or the volume! That simple. That amazingly satisfied!    These headphones are replacing a set of Jensen headphones I have used for years, and only THOUGHT I was satisfied with. This set is so much more comfortable on my ears, has clearer audio, and does not have signal fade like the Jensens.  I was continually adjusting the signal on the Jensens, and I have never even touched that adjustment on the Sennheiser RS120.    My wife works nights, and I use these to watch the news in the morning, without disturbing her. I can go outside to get the newspaper with no loss in quality. If I pause a video long enough for the auto shut off to take effect, it comes right back on within a second of restarting the video. (some reviewers did not like this feature--I have no problem with it)    The only thing I had to get used to was the wider profile of the headphones. I bumped the headrest of my chair if I turned my head to the side.  But that only happened a few times (the Jensens had a lower profile--which probably contributed to lower quality in the audio: these are great).    And I can't believe that I paid less for the Sennheiser RS120 than I did for the Jensens over four years ago.  Great product. Very pleased."
R3VT9Q02S4RACK,5,"Worked great right out of the box. I've used it every day since I got it and have never had a distance problem. Now I can play a movie and hear the movie sound as it should be. I can control my sound, while my wife controls the TV sound as she likes. Like I say, Rudolph loves it!!!"
RX752XVSH804P,5,"I settled on the Sennheiser RS 120's after doing alot of online research on various other brands and models. I have not been disappointed.The noise that some other reviewers have reported is non-existent in my particular case. Maybe it's something to do with where they have their base placed or other equipment interference.... mine sits right beside our 50\\"" Plasma which sits over top of a Stereo receiver and DVD player and they work Great! I can walk all through the house and never miss a word with no interference of any kind. My one and only complaint is that I wish I'd gotten them sooner! You could spend a ton more money and they still won't beat these."
R15D0PYS7Q79OC,5,"I am back for my second set! my first set wore out in about 9 years. I tried another brand , a few dollar's cheaper and hated them and was happy they died.<br />Why I love these headsets. The new ones fit a lot better than the old ones, not too big! but not too tight. ( the cheaper set was tight).<br />The dials on the side can be rolled fast! so I can turn ads off!!! ( cheaper set could not be rolled, they clicked! loud and slow, by the time I got them down it was time to turn up again!).<br />The sound quality is fantastic, the cheaper set was tinny and poor. Set up was easy, charging easy, just make sure its on  the dock.<br />I cannot recommend these enough, nine years of wear is very respectable!!!"
RK4VZ7JYGVXAC,4,"I think the headset sound quality is excellent.  I am pushing the sound through a High Def Time Warner DVR cable box.  I think the only challenge is the bulkiness of the headphones, they're a bit bulky."
R3GU43W488ZWPS,4,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle - These are excellent headphones.  I compare them with the AR I'd had for a couple of years before.  The ARs were heavier and required 3 triple a batteries compared to the RS210.  The charging station with the Sennheiser is also an improvement compared to AR.  These headphones are light and have a good sound quality.
RPX733JORATRH,5,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]<br /><br />Great sound quality.  Strong wireless signal throughout our house.  Seems high quality.
RXK4G820D3BUO,5,"I'm sure this might be an excellent product and as I had a chance to see the box prior to ordering I thought as the box looks, would be ideal for my PC [Lower right corner shows a CRT; obviously this points to PC use compatible]. NOT, the plugs are not compatible with a PC sound card plug in. I'm going to try and find an adapter that might work. Or return.    Edit, found a connector that would work, absent in the box and just to add to the pain, the unit will not charge. Apparently a RED light signifies a charged unit according to the manual. I do realize it states 24hr charge -One must get the friggin thing to charge, first. I'll give this 24hrs and then it's RMA. I was tempted to pop some batteries in, but this should work as advertized. So, I'll see. I want to see this thing charge up first.    I'm also waiting to see if I get the 'Hiss\\"" people talk about, course this is not a plug and play item, if you want to check that everything works. I'll be @ less than 12' in the same room. A recommendation to the company, provide non rechargable batteries as well so people might at least see it works before having to wait a day, not a problem for me; just saying."
R28WCL7CX54G29,4,"I have been using the rs120 for over a week now, and the quality of both the headphones and the sound they produce are excellent.  The only gripe I have by way of design on Sennheiser's part is the tuning knob.  Not only is it a little weird being right by the volume knob in a very exposed place. I don't think it should be there at all. An auto tune function would have been more suitable.  My next gripe may have more to do with the existing frequency bands available for use in commercial RF devices, but I guess there are an above average number of wireless devices running in my apartment complex.  I long for my own house again, now I have another reason to.  Interference is horrible for me.  Aside from that one obvious issue, I would recommend these headphones."
R2BIZN73MTZDMG,5,"These headphones work so well...as described or better.  My mom has lost a good portion of her hearing in both ears, so watching TV without the volume in the danger zone for everyone else is impossible.  They are lightweight, and she can move around the house while listening.  Mobility is very important for her because she likes to exercise while watching a DVD.  I am quite pleased, and so is she.  The only thing I would change is possibly adding an audio splitter, so we can watch along with her at normal volume & she still hears at increased volume.  I'm looking for options at radioshack, but lack of an audio splitter doesn't change my 5 star rating."
R1EUJGBWLACB85,5,"I have owned several wireless headsets which I use during my exercise routine. This is one of the best in sound quality,clarity, reception and comfort. It is well worth the money to find such a quality item. I would recommend it to anyone."
R2IY7GGF8D5KJ3,5,"After searching for a wireless headphone, and checking the recommendations of other users, I chose this set. I listen to Internet Radio, and books on CD. While listening with headphones connected with a chord I was tied to my computer. If I wanted to move to another part of my house, I needed to bring my whole computer. Now after having my wireless headphones tuned in, I can roam around the house and still get the clear reception.     For the price, I'm well pleased."
R2B56ZMOCZ8SET,3,Head set is too heavy and some people already mention it will fall down when you move your head down.
RN3N0JSH068MA,4,"I bought these headphones to replace a set of \\""wired\\"" headphones when playing live music.  The band uses headphones instead of monitors.  The headphone cable was always getting tangled with my guitar or around my neck and restricted me to a small area.  These wireless headphones do a great job except they go silent when no music is playing only after a few seconds.  Sennheiser needs to increase the time to about a minute or two before going silent then I would have probably have given these headphones a 5-star rating.  Still, I would rather be \\""free\\"" and have to wait on the band to start back up than to be tied to a post like a dog."
R32TW9VL56F8TG,5,I bought these headphones so that I can watch and listen to DVDs while using my exercise bike. They work very well and I subequently bought two more for my sons for the same purpose since they tried mine and liked it. I would definitly recommend purchasing these headphones.
R1Q8RRE9S00BQV,2,"These headphones didnt even work for me, but i did figure out that it only works for watching tv, nothing else, plus the directions are limited. I dont suggest this, but hey, why not give it a try"
R1BHYY172N1PL7,5,"The headphones are for my dad as he can't hear the tv.  He has two pair now, for each tv.  It has saved my sanity (and eardrums) as the tv doesn't have to be so high volumed now.  We both love them."
RB47S56ZSSE7Y,5,"These are a great set, I used them in work hooked up to my computer and walking around all sorts of equipment no problems at all. I have them at home now plugged into my tv and stereo equipment, they work perfect."
RG6D4TNE99KA6,5,"I bought the headphones, after i did my research of witch product will be better for my dollars, i saw Sony, Bose, and some others and the one that I needed and fit my budget ware the Sennheiser RS120 and the price was great, I even went to the electronics stores here locally and not even they got this price, so it was the perfect fit for my and my money, the sound quality its excellent and i even went out of the house to see if I still got signal and my surprise was that even that far (about 60 ft) i was amazed. great product."
R3DEWANQXSRG49,5,"I was skeptical of any wireless headset because of the interference and price ,,, I've patiently waited ,,, years. I'm in no hurry to make a mistake. A birdie told me that now the time was right. I selected this product ,,, I am nothing short of overjoyed ,,, in ecstasy with its fine production and reproduction !!!<br /><br />This product wears VERY well !!!

R1U82IN9R4I73,5,"This is a great set of wireless headphones.  I bought them for my wife because I don't want to listen to her TV shows - I like to read.  This was the perfect solution.  There is NO interference at all!!  I live in Staten Island, NYC and I was concerned of the interference but there was none at all.  They also look great and are really comfortable.    I love them- Highly recommend."
R2QBUIZLUVIJQO,5,"I bought this headset for my husbands birthday (he wanted a set with an extra long cord - he didn't even know wireless existed!  lol).  After much investigation regarding wireless headphones I thought I would give these a try.  He loves them.  He can walks all around the house, and outside and he gets great reception, and the cd player is in the basement.  Also, the headset is not hard to recharge, you just place it on the charging cradle, it's not rocket science, I don't understand why some reviews here list that as a problem, you'ld have to be a total buffoon to screw it up.  One small thing Ladies, I find myself calling, Rich, RICH, more and more now, before I was only NOT heard over sports, now I have added this new nightmare to the mix!!  :)"
R11K6V4E99OUGD,4,"Pros: Convenience, comfort, reasonable sound, low cost  Cons: Somewhat limited range, not great sound, volume and tuning dials too close together.  I am very sensitive to the physical feel of headphones: I can't keep most of them on for an extended period without irritating my ears.  These have just the right amount of springiness to stay in place without causing irritation.    The sound is pretty good, but not startlingly so, but then again, I'm listening to HDTV / DVD sound, so it may simply be the source.  It's certainly better that listening to the TV speakers, and there's a lot of detail and spatial realism in the sound - I often find myself looking around to see where a background noise is coming from, only to find it's something very subtle in the movie.  I can walk from the bedroom (where we have the big TV) to the kitchen (about 60 ft and three walls) before the sound starts to break up, so the range is ok for my purposes, but it would be nice if it was a little better.    Because they are right next to each other on the right earpiece, I occasionally find myself adjusting the tuning rotor instead of the volume control, which is annoying.    We now have four pairs of these, two for home, and another two we bought more recently at our vacation home, so obviously we're pleased with them:  overall, very good value for money."
RVAPUS8SF7GKS,3,I was hoping to score some wireless headphones that would allow me to listen to the TV radio w/o waking my wife (as I did with the cumbersome wired version). Was I in error? I have them transmitting from the audio output jack on the front of my old A/V Pioneer stereo receiver. No settings I've found so far have allowed me to do this. Guide me please!!  I have the tv speakers turned off and a home theater (circa the 80's) set up.
R15LFTUR6ARCGL,5,"These are an improvement over the previous version which were powered by AAA batteries:  it seemed we had to replace them quite often. In these headphones the charger works very well.  It also seems like the signal is stronger, thus the sound is even clearer."
R2IW3NATWJM0KA,5,The headphones work great and let me not bother my family by playing the TV loud. For the cost they are a bargan compared to other similar products. The range also lets me walk around my house and still hear the TV program.
RNJFCOFIHJ4XK,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    In an open office situation (cubicles), an office mate and I each brought the headphones so as not to bother others while we listen to our music, and were pleasantly surprised to find that by adjusting the tuner knob on the headphones we can hear each other's music perfectly - without any connection to each other's source. Really neat coincidence. - Jac & Julie"
R36MEHXPHBM29H,4,"Works as advertised. No fuss, simple operation. For us older people a real aid when watching DVD movies. Sound comes through clear and understandable."
R22PHMT1EISUGK,5,"I have owned one for a few years and recently bought one for my sister.  She was reluctant at first but now would not part with it. It allows her to listen to the TV at her own level of loudness and not disturb the others watching as well as walk anywhere in the house or yard while doing it. She plugs it into her CD player and can work outside or walk around the house for exercise while listening to the wonderful sound quality of these earphones. In fact, it was the quality of the sound which first got her interested in using it. The self charging rack feature is a great improvement. The first one I owned did not have this feature and I later bought a second with it."
R3O542ACL8GIPZ,5,It does everything in the sound department that I wanted it to do.  Being able to clamp the headset on tighter for jogging would be even better.
R185F9S8IALL9D,1,"Very disappointed. My wife and I work different shifts. I purchased these so my wife can watch TV while I sleep. Unfortunately... after a few weeks of trying to live with them, we gave up and eventually sold for at a garage sale for $5.<br /><br />Actually... when the work, they work quite well. Yes, there are bursts (pops) of static as you move around while wearing them  (like you might hear on a AM radio station turning a thunder storm) but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. If you sit in a chair, or are in bed, and remain stationary the static pops don't occur. They do emit constant nonstop static but its very minimal (similar to the white noise you hear when wearing noise canceling headsets). Then again... if you are an audiophile it will drive you nuts! I wouldn't recommend them for music but can tolerate it for TV viewing.  For most people its not<br />And issue. In fact, many don't even hear it (which explains the positive reviews)<br /><br />Actually... ignoring the static issue... they sound quite good.<br /><br />The problem is... they only work as long as there is sound being broadcasted! Once the sound source stops, you loose the signal connection between the headset and the transmitter and BANG...  LOUD STATIC!!!  Wow... it scares the crap out of you. You then must turn off the sound source (TV, receiver etc) and turn it back on to re-establish the connection to the headset.<br /><br />If the TV program you are watching goes silent (like during a quiet scene in a movie), or a few seconds of silence when the program goes to commercial break, or if listening to a quite passage in a piece of music... or the delay that occurs between music tracks on a record album... BANG ... The headset drops the connection to the transmitter and you get blasted with full volume static. This also happens if you hit the mute button for the TV! What a poor design!<br /><br />NET: Anytime, for any reason, that no sound is being transmitted... the headset thinks the TV or the signal to the transmitter has been shut off and the headset disconnects itself from the circuit. You then have to shut off the TV (or our sound source) and turn it back on to reset the headphones.<br /><br />I own several pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones and love them.

R3KIUN4P8GM8JP,5,These are very comfortable headsets.  The sound is fantastic and they have a great range.  I highly recommend them.
R2HJSXJH3JGD7L,5,"I have owned several sets of headphones for listening to my TV in the kitchen while my husband blasts another TV in the family room.  These are the first rechargeable ones and by far the most expensive.  They provide excellent sound (not that the TV is all that demanding) with no interference or static.  They worked immediately - I plugged the adapter into the headphone jack on my TV, turned on the headphones, and had clear sound.  They didn't even need tuning (usually for wireless you have to fiddle with the dials to get the base and headphones tuned exactly the same).  The charger works great.  The whole system takes a little more space than I'd hoped -- 9.5 inches tall and my shelf is 9.25 -- but the cords are generous so you can keep the base far from your tuner/TV.  Finally, the headset is very comfortable; my ears don't hurt after a few hours.  Headphones are highly recommended."
R39VCMUU9T868M,5,"I really like these headphones. I use them with my iPod docking unit to listen to audiobooks while I'm doing housework and with my laptop to watch tv online while my hubby watches football :)    I live in a two story and I can go upstairs and walk around and I still get a perfect signal. I haven't gone outside yet with them on but I'm sure they would work fine out there as well.     I like that there's a volume and tuning control right on the phones. They are very comfortable so I can wear them for several hours, and the sound quality has never decreased even after wearing them that long.    The only thing I would change is I would like it if the cushions surrounded my ears a little more....but all in all these are a great value for the money."
R39M0BD9PKCSJ5,1,These headphones are a complete waste of money. There is so much interference on these it's unbelievable. Please take these out of your store so that no one else falls victim to this scam. I'm serious.
R3U1X4DT7P7Y54,4,"For less than $100, you can have wireless headphones that are RF rather than line-of-site IR, which means you can get up from the sofa, walk to the kitchen for a cool one, or even go relieve yourself from too many cool ones...while not missing any of the program audio.  As with any over-the-ears full size headphones, they can make your ears sore if wearing them too long, but that's what commercials are for...when I take them off.  I even use them when the entire family is watching something if I really want to listen and they're chatting about other things.  My kids use them to play Rock Band without shaking the walls.  My father-in-law used them during a visit, as he likes to stay up late watching movies.  He absolutely loved them, so we ordered another set for his Christmas present."
R38UO187GL7XW7,2,"I puchased these so my wife can watch TV while I read.  I'm in law school, so I read everyday for many many hours.  Anyway, these headphones are horrible.  I don't know if it's Sennheiser's problem, or if the technology for wireless headphones just isn't that great yet.  In any case, here is a list of the problems we've had:  1)deafening static blares through them the second you push mute; basically, if no sound is going through them they start screaming at you so loud you almost throw them across the room.  For instance, if my wife wants to tell me something, she pauses the tv and starts talking to me, but then the headphones send that horrible static through them within a few seconds so she has to pause the TV and turn the headphones off.  This=annoying to her, and rightfully so.  I'll take a long cord any day over that nonsense.  2) There seems to be a bit of static interference most of the time.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes they sound great, but for the most part they do not.    3) We've also now had to replace the batteries, but we've only had them for about 1.5 mos.  That=lame.    Anyway, for the price these are not recommended.  I thought I was buying my wife the Ferrari of headphones, but I ended up with something more like a Daewoo after suffering abuse for five years at a rental company.    Again, I'm not sure if Sennheiser has anything to do with these problems; maybe the technology for these just isn't there yet."
R1LX3W7D4S06DG,4,"clear, crisp sound. No wires and I can walk around my entire apartment listening to TV or music, good range. Easy to use, just feels like very good quality item. Blocks out annoying neighbor and outside noises."
R3OPWMDFEOM6ZA,5,These headphones were a surprise for my husband...he loves them and it has made our household much more pleasant and quiet...
R1D1CSOZCQ47BH,4,"Setup tip: turn up the TV volume to about 70%, then adjust headset volume to suit. If you keep the TV volume down, then crank up the headset volume, you're gonna get alot of noise.     I am using the RS120 with a cheap color TV and DirecTV standard def box. The base station plugs into a headphone port on the TV. See comment above on setting the volume levels, before you conclude that the headphones are noisy.    I did have to charge overnight before the headphones were usable out of the box. Once charged, I used them very successfully for the first time last nite.  The sound quality is good, with a very light hiss of background noise. The background noise is not annoying and is way down in level, but is good since it tells you that you the headphones are on and it's the TV program that might be silent for the moment     The comfort is nice, but if you're sitting in bed with your head against a pillow, then you may find that the pillow sort of pushes the headphone cups away from  your ears. So it takes a bit of pillow punching to get everything squared away, but this unit perfectly accomplished my mission, which is: to watch TV at night without waking the spouse up.    Charging seems pretty automatic - just place the headset on the chargers hanging rack, and the red light indicates charging is going on. You don't have to be accurate about positioning.    Highly recommended. I did not give the full 5 stars just because at times I felt I heard some distortion in actors voices now and then... like a sample error of some sort... it was minor but noticeable. Not sure it wasn't the satellite downlink, but I never heard this through the TV speakers. I would recommend this unit to anybody, you will definitely be happy... I am nitpicking on holding back that 5th star."
R1DSPFBX07858F,5,Absolutely wonderful headphones for TV watching! I am hard of hearing and these have been perfect for me. They charge quickly and the sound is crisp and clear. I have had no static whatsoever.  I would recommend them to anyone.
R39HYYG50HBZNI,4,"If you are looking for a headphone set to watch television while you walk on a treadmill, this review is for you.  I have not tested this product with a stereo.<br /><br />I told myself to wait a few weeks before writing this review as I've only used it twice, but I can always update later if the headphones start acting up.  I just bought this on Oct 10th and paid $59.50 for it.  Before the headphones reached my door on Oct 16th Amazon jerked the price up ten bucks.  I probably wouldn't have made the purchase at the new price--the extra ten bucks would have been the difference between the maybe and I don't know I was experiencing when trying to decide about buying it.<br /><br />They need to knock that ten bucks right back off for the simple reason that the product totally lacks basic instructions.  You can go to the manufacturer's website, sennheiser dot com, and look at a PDF file of the actual instructions that come in the box with the product.  What you see is what you get.  It comes in nine different languages in a strip about two inches wide for each language.<br /><br />If you have a newer TV set and/or newer DVD player with multiple RCA output connections you won't have any problems.  (Unfortunately both my TV and DVD player were older models)<br /><br />As Amazon has raised the price of these, if you can find another RF (radio frequency) wireless headphone set at a cheaper price, you'd probably do just as well with those as this particular set.  The key is to get a wireless RF headset and NOT an infrared headset.  Wireless infrared headphones do not work with treadmills.  Treadmills interrupt the infrared frequencies.  So this review is more reporting on how RF headphone products work, indeed this particular product as it is the only one I've tried, but I imagine other RF headphones work equally well.<br /><br />The two times I've used it so far, it has worked fantastic.  I only watch DVDs while I walk on my treadmill so I have the headset's transmitter plugged directly into my DVD player.  (I had to switch out my old player with a newer model from the living room that had multiple RCA outputs)  I can turn down the TV volume to zero and turn up the headphones so loud they will almost knock me off the treadmill! (yeah, I turned it back down some)<br /><br />I think I read a review somewhere online about this product where the reviewer said their television still had to be at about mid volume in order for the product to work--maybe that reviewer had the receiver connected to their television, whereas I have mine connected to my DVD player.  As the manufacturer is silent regarding everything on the product, who knows, I can only tell you that I can turn my TV down to zero and the headphones cannot be at full volume without busting my eardrums.<br /><br />I hope this helped other treadmill headphone shoppers save some of the hours I spent looking for a headphone set.<br /><br />I only gave the product four stars because the manufacturer failed to provide a basic manual with the product and the quality of earphones themselves is a bit on the cheap side.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It is now the end of 2016 and these are still working.  I don't work out as much as I used to, but sometimes when I want to listen to the news while doing dishes I will wear these and they'd be great if the were not so loose and heavy, sliding off my head when I look down.

R1855G6TQU54LL,5,"I had a lighter weight Sony for several years. Used it for watching TV quietly. Time for something better.  This unit has clearer sound, can be heard in the next room and the earphones are very comfortable. The rechargable batteries can be replaced - a nice feature.  Works very well - has good directions."
R3AJ2866603QH6,5,"I can't say enough good about this set.  I had an old tube TV and used the Sony IR wireless.  They were OK, a little interference now and then, fairly comfortable.  I got a new Plasma TV and the Sony set wouldn't work with it no matter what I tried.  Too much loud static, could barely hear the TV.  I searched on the web and did a lot of reading and saw that most folks were very happy with this set.  There were a couple that still had static problems.  I decided to take a gamble.  I knew Amazon would take them back if they didn't provide clear sound with my set.  They arrived and I nervously hooked them up and put them on.  I heard static at first and thought, \\""Oh No!\\"".  Then I adjusted the channel dial and everything was clear as a bell!  They are extremely comfortable.  I can move about the house and still hear the TV fine.  The sound quality is superb.  I hear backround sounds on the DVD movie that I wouldn't have picked up before.  I'm very happy with this set and it is well worth the money to have cordless and rechargeable."
R39BRX4J51J97J,3,They are very comfortable but the TV still needs to be on at a medium level for them to work. We also have TV ears and they are not as comfortable but there doesn't have to be any sound coming from the TV in order to hear perfectly. TV ears are more expensive. I guess it depends on your individual priorities.
R586NRUESHOPX,4,"I have been using this headphone for a couple months now for watching TV without disturbing others. The audio quality is good, though I agree with others that the background hiss can be annoying if you pay attention to it at low volumes, but once you get involved in a show you don't really notice it. Reception is good, and the simple charger/antenna stand is really convenient. The ear pads are flat and have medium padding, so I find after an hour that my ears get tired (perhaps I have a big head)."
R3DLOEOLUB9WQ6,2,"Maybe I was hoping for too much. The bass is overboosted and static pops between quiet passages. Though wireless headphones are a great idea, look elsewhere."
R3N2Y0EODLDZFN,4,The headphones work well without too much static.  Drawback: They don't fit snugly on my head and fall off if I move my head forward or back.
R1N5VP9L4MJVGN,2,"I received this product today, and they sound really good.  The problem I have is they are poorly designed and will not stay on my head.  The earpads are flat and cheap.  I will be returning them, as everytime I move my head they slip off.  This is terribly annoying."
R3KUINRYJKX2GQ,4,I love these!  This is the second pair I have purchased and this pair doesn't fall off my head like the first pair did.  Sound is excellent and I can go all over my split level home and still hear the sound!
RV9K9LLY24BRQ,4,I read many reviews of this product and was convinced it would work even though there were some reviews that hated the product (1 and 2 star ratings).      The product is very enjoyable and worth buying.  I have used it by plugging in the audio cables through my cable box and the quality has be very good - good enough to use while walking around the apartment.    So it's worth buying if you're looking for something that will giving you slightly above average sound quality with some static interference once and a while.
R25VCXPSQEQOOG,2,"I'm a software developer. I'm on my computer all day and I wear headphones so that I can ignore what's going on around me. I hate having to manage the headphone cord, it's always getting caught on things. So I decided it would be a good investment to buy some wireless headphones. I looked around a bit on Amazon and noticed that these headphones had over 500 reviews and was rated at 4 stars, pretty good I thought. So I ordered them. But when I got them set up with the receiver literally about 18 inches from my head I got static and high pitch squeaking. I really did try ALL the troubleshooting options Sony details in their troubleshoot guide that come with the headphones. The suspicious thing is that there are about 15 different things Sony suggests that may be the source of bad performance from the headphones...why are there so many? Nevertheless, none of the fixes worked, and sadly I realized I would now have to go through the hassle of returning the headphones for a refund. Fortunately, Amazon has an awesome return system/policy and I got my money back. So I'm back looking for another set of wireless headphones. I don't recommend buying these headphones."
RYU57W0P8B155,3,"Sound quality is good, but I was really unhappy with the manual on/off switch (other wireless headphones I've had switch on and off when placed on your head).    Charging method of hanging the headphones on a rack mounted on the base means it takes up quite a bit of room.    Could have been done better."
RSDPZI48KSZF9,5,"Based on reviews, I returned the Sony product that I purchased at a local store (for almost 50% more than Amazon was selling the exact same product for).  These headphones have great sound, are easy to charge (on the included stand), and I am overall very happy with the purchase.  They are made of quality and shouldn't break easily like other headphones.  They are a bit on the heavy side, but i don't find them falling off like other reviewers.  I use mine for watching TV, and they work great!"
RPESZVGSOT1KH,3,"I just received my pair and they are soo loose that when I tilt my head forward they just fall off. I would like to wash dishes or vacuum w/them on but this problem prevents me from doing so. Sound is alright, some static. Not that great to me."
RV65TS9S9AHTE,3,"I bought this because I live in a dorm and play bass guitar and wanted a way to play through my amp without disturbing everyone.    They work fairly well through my computer when I listen to tunes, though I have been disappointed by the quality running through my amp.  However, I probably should not expect them to be of even decent quality when feeding such low bass frequencies through them.  All in all they do what they promise.    But if you for some reason are looking at them like I was to play an instrument through an amp, I would either buy something cheaper that will also sound like crap or something really really expensive that has great low-end."
R287JOMFQFQEK0,5,"For years I had been unable to hear TV programs without turning the volume so high it disturbed others, I also wear a hearing aid, The Sennheiser RS 120 Headphones work exceptionally well with the hearing aid and I Hear every word perfectly , I can go anywhere in my home and still hear what I am listing too. I highly recommend these headphones ."
RNDZV8986V8H9,5,I have only used the headphones a few times (I got them so I could listen to the television while my wife was sleeping) and the sound was clear and static free.  The headphones are light and comfortable and I can roam throughout the house and get clear reception.
R301HLTXANZLW6,2,"Pros:<br />- Ability to be mobile and free without the hassle of tangling cords.  This was my main reason for the purchase.<br />- Dirt-cheap price (on Amazon).<br />- Good sound quality as mentioned by others.<br />- Nice, snug fit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Foam ear pads; I CANNOT stand foams against my ears.  Uncomfortable, warm, and irritating.  I'm surprised that not a single person has mentioned about this.<br />- I bought these for my PC use, not for TV.  Lots of static noises heard when trying to re-use the headphone after about 10-15 min of idle time.  Solution?  Unplug and plug back in the connector to the PC's sound card port.  After doing this for about 10 times, I realized that I'd rather go back to my old headphone.<br />- Falls off when bending over.  If you can run a marathon wearing this, good on you.  Comfortable and snug enough to stay on your head if you stay sitting down or lying down, but not light enough that it won't fall off your head.  Someone mentioned baseball cap.  If you absolutely must go outside to dig trenches while listening to your favorite MP3s wearing this thing on a hot, muggy afternoon, more power to you.<br /><br />I tried this for 2 days and decided I'll go back to my old Sony (wired) headphone.  This is a good product at a very low price for what it does: enabling you to be mobile withing certain ranges.  But if you are like me, stick with old-school headphones.  And take them off if you have to move around or go outside to dig holes to hide your latest treasure."
R2AVHS6KCE0LW7,4,"I use these headphones at work to cancel out background distractions.  This is the thrid set of headphones that I have purchased for this purpose.  I particulary appreciate the rich sound quality of this set.  I also like the charging setup since previous units have required a plug to be inserted whereas these only need to be placed on the charging unit. Another feature that I appreciate is the \\""Tune\\"" (I originally thought this was the \\""Tone\\"" control and couldn't understand why the music would stop when I adjusted the tone).  Instead this control is used to accommodate for any drift in the transmitter/receiver link making is easy to make adjustments if the reception should degrad (I haven't really noticed this as a problem yet). The headset is operated about 10 hours a day (charged overnight every night) and the battery has never run down. I turn them on in the morning and off immediately prior to going home.  The base station transmitter will shut down if it doesn't sense incoming sound (i.e. the mute button on the musice souce is active).  As soon a sound inputs are resotred it turns itself back on.    Things that I think could use improvement; the headband and the earphones are offset shich means that when the headband is directly over your ears the earphones are canted back about 30 degrees.  This affects the comfort of the headset.  Also, the on/off switch seems to be of cheap quality.  It hasn't given and sign of failure so far but I suspect it will the be first part to fail.

R2R7TFMOD11EJU,4,"My wife was constantly asking me to turn ther volume down while she read. I finally decided to solve the problem once and for all. I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones and now I can watch... and listen to my favorite TV sports programs while she sits in the same room and reads.  These phones do exactly what they advertise; reproduce good sound while allowing you to turn the TV volume off so it doesn't disturb others. While not studio quality sound, it is good enough and also blocks out most ambient noise so all you hear is the game itself. I haven't yet tried the phones with music and am anxious to see how they do. I especially like the cradle which recharges the phones while they are not being used.  You can also walk around the room or even go to another room and sound volume and fidelity does not change.  These were a VERY worthwhile purchase for me. I completely recommend them. The only reason I give them a \\""4\\"" instead of a \\""5\\"" is because I have no basis for comparison regarding sound quality and so assume that there might be something a little better for more money out there."
ROJPY74R1JV4X,5,"This my third wireless headphone.  It is my second Sennheiser product.  The quality of both are superb.  Less static than the RCA and Sharps Image models, faster re-charge rate.  Better sound quality.  I like the design of the battery compartment also.  Twist one ear pad and there they are."
R2HYBKMIREK7CV,4,"I purchased a pair of these headsets for watching TV after the kids go to bed. They have excellent sound quality, battery seems to last quite long, considering 2-3 hours of use each night. Maybe charge them once a week.<br /><br />Loves:<br />1. They are RF. Goodbye IR wireless headphones that only work infront of the transmitter. Now I can wander into the kitchen and still hear what's going on.<br />2. Rechargable with 2 AAA batteries. If they are absolutely dead, I can grab batteries out of storage and fire them back up.<br /><br />Problems:<br />1. The smallest setting for the headband is still not that small. My oldest (6yo) can wear the headphones, but they fall off if she moves around. Considering she wears a hat 2 sizes larger, they are designed for a much larger head.<br />2. Their is no indicator light to show that they are on, or if the battery is charged. You have to physically look at the switch to see if they are on. Charged? Well, do you hear sound, try fiddling with them and make sure they didn't change tuning.<br />3. The last month or so, a neighbor has started using his shortwave radio. In certain places of the house, I can pickup his conversation over his CB. Not quite as entertaining as the TV.. I've changed the tuner options on the headphones the other day and haven't heard from him again.<br />4. Can only charge them on that gianormous base. If you plan to use them with your entertainment center, plan on making space for that large transmitter base, that is accessible so that you can charge them. Putting it behind the TV creates a bit of electrical interference (buzz). Maybe on top the EC cabinet? :)"
R8EULH4MJM3BU,5,"I got these to replace a wired Sony set I had for 12 years.  It was a good change for me.  The sounds are crisp and detailed and being wireless is terrific.  I'm an audiophile and very particular about my sounds and these are A+.  Only so often I will hear a quiet burst of interference but I don't blame the system one bit.  The base is resting on my 12\\"" JBL powered subwoofer next to my Onkyo rack with a MonsterPower line conditioner not 15\\"" from it.  I can freely move about the house listening away and it stays clear.  Setting it up initially scared me a bit, you really do need to have it plugged in to a source before powering up the base.  This sets the 'auto-on' for the unit.  It didn't work initially, then I followed the instructions and it was okay.  The base also didn't want to initially charge the headphones, getting the contact pads to touch the charge rail was ackward.  I bent them out a bit and it charged fine.  My head is a bit big so the phones naturally widened.  Now I can toss the phones on the base and it starts charging easily."
R5T3PQ7N8KEES,5,I wear hearing aids and the headphones recognizes it so as to avoid feedback. Clarity and range are phenomenal. So far I'm very satisfied with the product.
R3UIKQRVEPZ8V5,5,"My new headphones lets me hear things in movies that i have seen before, so now i watch some of the movies over again"
R29D2QH8RCD7U0,4,"Pros: Excellent sound quality, easy to use. good range.  Cons: the only complaint I have is the size of the product, it is very bulky. I often like to watch TV in bed, but this product is too big to wear to sleep."
R3C13SJRP4JN6T,5,"My husband has been blessed with great hearing, and I on the other hand have not. When watching TV or a movie I was missing much of the softer talking which took the fun out of it for me, always asking what was said. I had to have the TV on a high volume which made it not fun for him or our neighbors. The wireless head phones work great for me. I can now hear everything and can also watch TV after he goes to sleep. The volume on the TV can almost be off and I turn my headset up and I'm in heaven. Thanks for stoping the volume battle.  Tanya F  Seattle WA"
R2X4FJ2YZS8CEO,5,"I had developed a mutual hatred with my neighbors due to thin walls. However Sennheiser saved the day with these headphones. The quality is much better than my TV speakers, and no more noise!"
R33H4KBP6ETMPQ,5,"My wife claims that this is \\""the best investment ever\\"". The sound is crystal clear and compliments our HD system. It's perfect for watching a movie on the HD while the kids are sleeping just next door. I own two pairs, and they are both running on the same transmitter so both my wife and I enjoy the movies together.<br /><br />Great product thus far and used daily..."
R1YBI0D886BK47,3,"This is an addendum to a previous glowing review (at least I think I reviewed it previously... it would have been glowing, in any case). Sound quality is excellent, fit is tolerable, and it's just wonderful to be able to hear complex dialogue, etc. But as time went on, recharging became less and less reliable, and now it has absolutely given up the ghost. At first I could rejuvenate the recharging by gentle abrasion of the recharging surfaces, but it no longer works. I bought these in January, 2007, so they lasted about 1.5 years. I miss them a lot and often think, \\""I need my headphones,\\"" only to remember that they don't work anymore! Pretty expensive for such a limited time. Consider yourself warned."
R2TNKUWY423LWG,1,"I was very excited to recieve the headphones in the mail.  I opened it and it worked great for about two days.  Then  I just got interference and it wouldnt come in clearly.  I tried moving it around the house, trying different stations.  Nothing worked. I ended up returning the headphones and was very impressed with the efficiency of the Amazon return sytem."
R1OF8T4HG3W26N,5,"My husband's hearing loss has caused both of us discomfort. For me discomfort because he always has the TV turned up so loud. I bought the Sennheiser 120 because of the previous reviews and the cost. I thought, well, if he doesn't like them, I'm not out a great deal of money. and other reviews said they liked the 120 better than the more expensive ones. My husband loves them! He can hear the TV at his own level and has commented to others that he can still hear them in other rooms of the house, at the mailbox and working around the yard. Sometimes he just puts on music channels when working in the yard. A great investment and gift for a guy needs them and who usually buys himself whatever he wants. Beware, though, ladies, they can also hear you better in the background. Haven't had a problem since day one. They are truly great!"
R1CUJH7EN21849,3,"The sound quality is good and the setup is simple. However, every 15 minutes, there is a disruption on the reception for about 2 seconds. The headphone loses the audio and becomes normal again in 1 to 2 seconds. It's annoying. I have tried different positions, but it remains the same. I don't know the reason. It might be the device or environment. I do not recommend this product."
R1FA2G3Z3THQOH,5,"Excellent product.  I have the Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones for aircraft travel, which is why I bought these.  I find them more compact and less bothersome (i.e., do not cover the ears like the Bose) than watching my fellow passengers pulling out their huge Bose earphones and seeing them sweat into the earpads.  Sennheiser has done more engineering and planning in the development of their earphones.  This wireless set is comfortable and \\""clear as a bell\\"".  John Hollett"
RDC9W61GB6RYX,4,"The item performs well, in fact it is everything that I had hoped for except for the ear cushions. The present cushions set on the ear and become uncomfortable after a time. I think that the ear cushions should be made to fit around the ear and allow the phones to rest on the skull. I've been unable to find \\""around the ear\\"" cushions as an accessory from the manufacturer or an after market supplier."
R1Q6SMYVXJ9A7W,5,Perfect head phones for watching TV.  I am a night owl and had to watch TV on low sound.  So much nicer to be able to watch loud tv late at night while my husband and daughter sleep.   So far perfect reception and sound.
R2MKDTGTF8A6E4,2,This headphone set worked very well with limited use. I've had it for a litle over two months and the problems are now starting. The headphone cut off after approximately 10 minutes and it takes quite awhile to get the tuner to work again as well as getting rid of the noise associated with it. I thought it might have been my location and I used the less expensive RS110 which worked perfectly.     I do not recommend the RS120 unless you have to have re-chargeable batteries. The RS110 is a better headset at a much lower price. The only difference is that the RS110 uses regular batteries so don't waste your money on the less reliable RS120.
R2KNCAYZ6VXTWF,4,"Pros:  Great sound  Good fit  Easy, stylish charger  Light weight    Cons:  Don't like to stay put  Volume/Tune knobs unprotected and next to each other  Autooff generates static    Things I haven't tested suffciently:  Battery life  Range    These headphones do what wireless headphones should do: They play sound, and they play very rich sound. I'm happy with these headphones, and would buy them again. This review mainly deals with issues I've had with them, so people have a better idea about the product.    First, my biggest issue is that the Tuning and Volume knobs (well, wheels) are unprotected. That means there is nothing preventing you from brushing them if you settle back into a highbacked chair, or scratch an itch on your ear. You might get treated to a jarring blast of static if you bump the Tuning knob accidently.    The odds of this happening are compounded by the fact the knobs are next to each other. Several times I've gone to adjust the volume only to have the music turn to static. This is pretty annoying; the ability  to stop the tuning from being adjusted with a Hold switch or similar would do much to improve these headphones.    Another annoyance is that the base station, but not the headphones, go to sleep after several minutes of no sound. I have these plugged into my computer, and was listening to a CD while lying in bed. I was not quite asleep when the CD ended, when ZAP! I was jolted out of bed, ripping off the headphones as the silence was replaced by very loud static. Needless to say, these aren't going to be used to help me sleep anymore! However, whitenoise is said to help you get to sleep, so perhaps this a feature and not a bug. Perhaps a switch on the base station to prevent this would be useful. (These are also ment to be plugged into a TV it seems, so perhaps this wasn't a consideration for its intended use)    The last isssue is that while the headphones are very comfortable and fit well, they don't fit very well unless you are almostmotionless. If you want wear these to do chores like I do, you'll be constantly adjusting and trying futility to keep them on your head. If you're sitting in a chair listening to music or watching TV, or sitting at the computer, this won't be an issue. But if you want to listen to some tunes while mopping or doing dishes, you will encounter some issues.    Again, even with these issues, I'd still buy these again."
R2RFWR17UV0XWE,4,"I received the headphones about a week ago.  Don't notice the hiss that others have complained about.  I sit about 15 feet from the receiver and the  signal is good.  For $75, I am satisfied with my purchase."
R58NXRZMMDNTP,5,What a great pair of headphones! I especially love using them when listening and watching high definition channels on my T.V. The sound quality is unbelievable. You can hear virtually all the instruments being played which makes you feel like one of the audience members at a concert. They are worth every penny.
RSQ6V91Y7EQ8O,4,I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it! He owns an online business and has the headphones hooked up to his computer's stereo system and can walk around freely while working! He really enjoys them and I could not be happier!  I made my decision based on [...] I highly recommend it if you're shopping for electronics!<br />:-D
R2DRPQEDX58I5M,1,"unit constantly has to be reset. Does not auto tune. When signal is correct, if you touch the tuneing control, you lose the clarity. Not a great product."
R1FTKD28TKINHE,3,"Not as sturdy as I expected, but I suppose they should hold up to regular wear and tear. Sound quality is adequate; the range of bass and treble are ok, but a background hiss is audible even when at a short distance from the transmitter. Overall, the fact that these are wireless and allow me to watch TV at night without waking up the whole household is invaluable. However, considering that any reasonable pair of corded headphones would easily provide better sound, the $70 price tag appears a bit excessive."
R2RQ7H75W74HZ0,5,"I originally bought the Sennheiser headphones for listening to the tv/radio while on the treadmill, however, I have found myself using them for mowing the lawn (an acre and the reception is great!) and gardening as well.  My only wish is that they fit a little more snug to my head.  Other than that, they are perfect!"
R3GKYNM58KLCF6,5,Just received item and worked great out of the box.  Just what I wanted and sound much better then my direct connect headphone..
RTHXLNH4MUBYI,3,"I live in a retirement community and after 8PM, it has the sound of a graveyard.   No noise is allowed.  And one of my neighbors has complained about some of my music.  He told me to stand in the street between his house and mine, and if I could hear my TV or stereo, it was too loud.      He likes telling me off since I'm a General and he's a Navy Master Chief (we are both retired.) And so I ordered these headphones to mollify the Master Chief.      Well, it does exactly that.  And they aren't too uncomfortable considering it's Florida and somewhat hot in summer.  So I don't use them during the day.   If I sit in front of the Stereo or TV, I get excellent reception.         If I wander about the house, I either get no reception or poor reception at times with static and noise.  You have to adjust the Radio Frequency (RF) tuner to eliminate ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) and other interferences, kind of like you would adjust a military communications radio, a wide-band or VHF radio, or one of those Citizen's band radios (I think it functions like a squelch knob.) In modern radios, the squelch knob is gone, so why not on these headphones.   I only wish the RF tuner would stay tuned, but I seem to have to adjust it with each wearing.    All in all, I think I got what I paid for, and the Master Chief has begun to complain about other things.  Oh well, someday I'll sick a Sargent Major on him who will teach him proper military etiquette.  In the meantime, I will wear the headphones."
R1YCABNZ7CU30N,1,"I purchased this item for about 60 british pounds, had to pay about 23 pounds for customs, UPS will only deliver if you pay up.  Then found out I could not get this to work because the voltage is based on the American system.  I admit, this item maybe terrific,but unfortunately I have never had the chance to try it out!!!  I am so gutted about it!!!"
R249GIDYNKPY1U,4,The headphones are the best Ive used.  Im 69 and have problems hearing unless I turn up the volume so high it iritates others.  They do the job just fine and are comfortable.  Id rate it 5 stars but they fall of when Im up doing things.  The tuner also sometimes needs reajustment as it is easy to move it when putting them on or taking them off.
R1MI99RBGVYHHU,4,"These headphones were easy to setup out of the box.  The only real minor challenge was to manually tune the headphones to receive audio.  After tuning, the sound comes out great.  As other people have mentioned, there is a low hissing noise when no audio is coming from the source, but it's minor.  I can walk around my apartment with these headphones and the audio comes through pretty clear though I've had instances where the sound did cut in and out momentarily---probably interference from some external source. The phones are comfortable to wear because it has good padding and is light weight."
R3K0Z5RQKPVXT5,5,I bought the wireless headphones(sennheiser 120) for my husband<br />He loves them.  He had a pair of Sony but likes these much better.<br />He likes to set on the deck in the afternoons and lister to his favorite<br />shows.  Very good buy
R3KA424G57SLON,4,Purchased the ear phones so that i could watch TV without interfearing with what my wife was watching in an adjacent room. Works like a charm.
RFEASM5KCEHSU,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]<br /><br />I bought this headset to watch movies and/or listen to music on a computer while walking on a treadmill at the same time. Without them, I either had to have the pc speakers blasting, to hear above the treadmill's motor, or lip read the dialog in movies. Both examples were annoying and unacceptable to me.<br /><br />Pros:  The headphones solved both problems. The stereo sound quality is good, and they were easy to setup initially too. So I'm satisfied with my purchase for these reasons.<br /><br />I should mention that I paid for ground shipping and expected them to take more than a week to arrive. However I received them in just a couple of days. I would definitely recommend this company.<br /><br />Cons:  I dropped two stars off my rating for two reasons though. First, the product description said the headphones would work up to 300 feet away from the base. And I paid more for that added feature. However, I get static just moving from one room to another--less than 50 feet away.<br /><br />Secondly, the headphones are adjustable as far as how high or low they fit on the head and ears, by sliding the ear pads in or out of the head strap.  But they don't have any adjustment on how lose or tight they grip the head, and consequently fall off whenever I bend over. Needless to say, I've given up on using them outside for gardening, the other reason for purchasing them in the first place.<br /><br />Update: As of November 9, 2013 my headphones are still going strong after more than five years! I'm revising my star rating up by one because of this. ;-)"
RA0GDZVWWPFZY,3,"I think my wife enjoys these more than I do because now the TV isnt up so loud ! They are ok, once in a while with out warning the power light turns off and I get an ear full of static but over all I am enjoying them."
RLIDVDVR98C14,5,"These headphones do exactly what they're supposed to - they free you from a cord, comfortably and efficiently. Just make sure to fully charge the batteries before you use them. If you use them with the low charge the batteries have out of the box, you'll think something is wrong. You need to charge them for 24 hours before the first use.   Once fully charged, the performance is quite good. In my smallish apartment in NY, which has a lot of interference sources, I get a very good signal in every room with little to no noise. Sound quality is not as good as audiophile corded headphones (I have Grados for that), but for TV watching while my wife's asleep or casual music listening the RS120 is just the ticket, and the price is right."
R1MD5H5QZ8S3G9,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]   Frist the reception is great with little interference unless I am more than 45 feet away. The sound is geat, bass is good and highs. whoever says these don't sound good are not comparing wireless head sets. I have bought another set for my Mother-in-law. And she called me to send info for their friends becasue they said the head sets are sooo good. i bought these on June 18th so had them about a month."
R2FD51JY1JLM10,4,"The Sennheiser RS120 is a good set of wireless headphones for those looking to escape the cords and wire.    The sound is just rich enough so that the bass isn't shaking your head constantly, which works great for me. There isn't any real sound canceling per se, so those looking to enjoy their own world of music need to look elsewhere. The effective range is good. I even got about 100 feet away while the base station was in the basement and I was outside in the back yard. That is a win. Battery life seems to be at 12-15 of usage before recharge. However, you will hear the difference in sound quality once the power levels are low. Just hang it up before bed, and it is good for another day.    It also feels comfortable on your head not weighing you down or anything, and every once in a while you would forget you had them on.     However, comfort is gained at a price. The headphone placed over your head and ears is a bit loose. Comfortable? Yes. Falling off when bending over? All the time.      I would recommend to buy this and just get carried away in the music."
RBZDVXKURK4QK,2,"The sound is good, the charging on the stand is good, but the headphones themselves are bulky and heavy. The fatal flaw is that when I move my head the plastic hinges creak and pop, interfering with the music."
R13WN9IQC2WW5,5,"It seems one of the biggest complaints about these headphones is that some people are having trouble getting them to charge in the cradle. Here's the deal, if you put them on one way the charge is a little touchy but if you simply turn them around the other way they charge perfectly. The connectors are even magnatized to ensure a good connection.    They are great headphones and I highly recommend them."
R3G4H9MEJBWFZ8,4,It looks very good.  One thing that I don't like is needs to tune the wireless signal.
R18NNOM04394DH,4,"I have had the headphones for about a month. I'm really pleased with them. I use them primarily to watch TV at night so as not to disturb others. The ability to walk around -- bathroom, kitchen and just turning away from line-of-sight to the TV and still get sound as clear as can be is worth the extra dollars over infra-red phones.<br />I also listen to music while moving around the house. I think the sound quality is very good. I've had no problem with reception, even while taking out the trash (100' away). My one criticism is the phones tend to want to slip off my head when I bend over.<br />Placing the phones on its cradle when done and having it automatically recharge as the phones sit there is convenient."
R1RT58HKIROUJY,5,"I have been looking at various reviews for wireless headphones. These are great. Very comfortable to wear for long. The sound is very clear. I dont hear any static. I have not had an opportunity to roam around the home too much. Pretty much use it during late night TV viewing. I had an optimus IR headphone which had a lot of static and did not have a re-chargeability. The re-charge base is very convenient. I looked at the higher models of the same, but thought, for the money this was a steal. Got it on Amazon for $80. If you are looking for auto tuning capability or a closed ear cup, you will need to look at the RS130 or RS140."
R1KRHSXWTC32VD,4,I bought these for my wife to watch TV in bed when I want to sleep but I also found out they are just as handy for me when I want to walk on the treadmill and she is wanting to watch TV in the living room I can listen to Serious Radio music at the same time! I found them to be great if you stay in one place but can be a little erratical when moving from room to room but mind you -- not that bad.  I gave them a 4 star & not a 5 because of this!
R16LL0O5YOX1GS,5,I highly recommned this product based on the following:<br />1) Excellent sound<br />2) Ease to install<br />3) Friendly to use<br />4) The battery run out after 5-6 hours<br />5) Great price
RA2O4L9MX6L88,5,"I bought these headphones so I could study in peace while my boyfriend watches TV or plays video games.  I got them from Amazon for $69.99 and they are WONDERFUL (and a relationship-saver)!    This is our second set of wireless headphones -- the first set was made by RCA and purchased without any research.  We didn't use the first set much because it had terrible reception and the batteries died frequently, so when it stopped working altogether, I did a lot of research and considered much pricier models before settling on the Sennheiser RS 120.       We are incredibly happy with these headphones.  I can't even imagine how the more expensive Sennheiser models could perform better (I'm sure they do), but we are completely satisfied with this set.  The sound is great and we think the charging station is pretty neat looking.    Note to other purchasers - we initially had problems with low but constant static/hissing, but this was resolved when we plugged the audio cables into the red and white RCA jacks instead of the socket labeled \\""headphone\\"" on the  back of the TV.  The sound is absolutely CRYSTAL CLEAR now.  I'm glad we played around with it for awhile and figured out a solution.      We live in an area with lots of potential interference (we live in midtown Manhattan, only 1 block from the Empire State building and our charging station is placed squarely next to a whole mess of electronics, including our cable box, TV, PS3, XBOX360, laptops, wireless internet router, cell phones, etc) but we have not experienced any static or hissing.  These headphones have exceeded all my expectations -- I would highly recommend them without any reservations.  All the positive reviews are well justified."
RPPO590O0MPHB,5,"I've had these headphones for a good 6 months now, and I have to say they've exceeded my expectations.    Quality wise, the sound is clear, legible and has a good range. Depending on how it's hooked up to your television, turning up the source all the way and keeping the actual speaker volume control fairly low seems to eliminate all of the frizz that so often plagues wireless headphones,     I've dropped these more times than I care to admit, and they have yet to suffer from it, really sturdy headphones.    Range: I was rather surprised at the distance these not only continue operating at, but continue to sound good at- I can walk a hundred feet away from my house and still hear crystal clear. Though if you live around many sources of radio signals your range may not be quite as far.    Finally, one of the main reasons I purchased this particular pair-the charging base, it works perfectly, having to swap batteries or even use *shudder* Non Rechargeable batteries didn't appeal to me at all, and this solves that problem in a stylish easy to use manner, all one has to do is drop the headphones onto the base and they begin charging, a really well thought out feature and it works exactly like it should.    The only thing I didn't care for was the cloth earpads, though it's a matter of personal preference I prefer leather or plastic ear cups which grip my ears a little better, that said the earpads they have are comfortable and don't chafe.    In the end these do exactly what they're supposed to plus a little, and for the price are a really topnotch pair of wireless headphones, and if you're looking for a quality pair of wireless headphones at a good price, you can't go wrong with these."
R2XKNDAMKG55XJ,5,"I bought this to replace an older SONY with similar features.  For what my husband wants it for, it is perfect.  It is ready and charged when he wants it to watch TV without disturbing me or if he needs additional help hearing the TV when everyone else is happy with the volume level.  He is also able to walk into the kitchen and still hear it which he wanted.  Overall he seems really happy."
RW06RLHD10A4I,5,"The wireless headphones are great for 2 people with different hearing capabilities, or even for 2 people in one room, one of whom wants to watch TV, the other of whom wants a quiet environment. Walk outside as far as 300' from the TV and hear the audio clearly. Easy to install and use. The headphone ear pieces are comfortable. The headphone could use better padding on top of your head, although it is not a significant discomfort. Headphone has fallen off my head when I bent over. Great product I would recommend without reservation."
R1BCQST81PYPYV,5,"I love  these headphones..easy to install, WORK great first time I used them was able to walk all over my place no interruption no hiss..great bargain I have no complaints...!"
R3332MVLDXG24V,1,"Even used with in 20ft from the base and tune to the right freq...then after a while, lost the audio signal and filled with a loud static noise.  I was disappointed for the price I paid.  On a positive note, if you are using it for your TV class, this might work well.  By the time you wondering off, it will brings you with a loud...sahhhh...in your ear."
R2UMOYEKXY3HPK,5,"I have been using these headphones for a few months now and am very happy with them.  They offer clear sound, are comfortable, and were easy to set up.  I definitely recommend them."
R17MRASPYA6NFD,4,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    I bought the headphones to use while residing in an apartment, which has allowed me to watch movies late at night without disturbing the neighbors. The setup is essentially plug-and-play. Simply put the rechargable batteries into the headphones and then connect the base station to the audio output of the TV. The base station does have the option to change the transmittion channel in case there is interference at your location. The default setting worked fine for me. On the right headphone one can adjust volume and fine tune the reception. If the volume is adjusted too high on the headphones then a background hum may occur. This can be eliminated by reducing the volume on the headphones and increasing the volume slightly on the TV. The sound quality is very good for the comfortable price of the set to include good bass output. The left headphone has an on/off switch and BTW, the stand for the headphones functions as a battery charger. The headphones are adjustable and comfortable and wearing them for several hours is not tiresome. I am not sure how far the signal will transmit but the sound quality was good through my apartment. Overall, this is a very good buy."
R26SWMEG1767Z9,5,"Works well, and as promised. The only negative - it is a little heavy and doesnt 'hold' to your head very well. I use this when I walk on my treadmill and am watching TV at the same time, and it keeps slipping off my ears. Not a big problem though, and I wish they had created a method to increase the tension in the headset mechanism so it would hold tighter. The sound quality is good - if it doesnt come through well, there are 3 channels I can try. Between all 3, at least one comes through well."
R29EU27I8OUZ5,4,"I have been wanting to switch to wireless headphones for a long time, mostly because of the fact that I always get wrapped up in the cords or my pets mess with the cord. I was skeptical to switch because of quality and price. However, after reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try these out. I am pleased with them so far. They have great range with little to no loss of quality in and around my house.    The ONLY real negative thing I have seen (heard rather) is the Automatic Gain Control which to my knowledge, can't be turned off. If you listen to music with sudden changes, such as movie soundtracks or classical, every time you get a sudden noise, such as drums, cymbal, etc, the Automatic Gain Control lowers to volume to compensate for the sudden increase in volume, or so it thinks. This can make your music somewhat inconsistent, which can be annoying. I would imagine with more constant sounding music, it would be a non-issue though.    That being said, I am still happy with my purchase, and would recommend them to someone looking to get away from a corded set."
RWM6JC19T87RC,5,I lready had a set of these as hubby is slowly losing hearing and has difficulty understanding shoes on TV - these make it very clear & easy to understand - so I go one for my sister for Chrismas twho was having the same issue. Cannot beat the quality of Sennheiser products.
R36RHSKOXHVBL9,1,"I am used to hearing no background hiss from a sony $20 pair of wired headphones.  When I used this product there was a constant hissing sound and when I walked more than 10 feet from unit it was succeptible to interference. This could probably be eliminated if you spent hundreds of dollars on a more expensive headphones.  I simply wanted to listen to MP3 on my computer, now I just used my wired headphones and carry the Mp3 player with me."
R3KWAUDDXDN6TR,4,"I got this to replace an IR Sony 240, when I couldn't stand the hiss any longer.  I did have the top model previous series Sennheiser that got lost in a move, but it used a propritary battery with very short life, and expensive to replace.  The RS120 is much better than I had expected for the price.  Uses standard AA recharable batteries now.  Sound quality is quite good, no hiss, but it needs a good amplitude input source, or the autogain will run the amplification up and give some nose.  Not a problem with my setup.  The frequency selection is surprisingly low tech.  Set a switch on the transmitter for the channel, but the headphones have an analog tuning wheel.  Most everyone else uses more precise channel select.  However, the setting span of the analog wheel is very wide, lots of movement for small changes in frequency.  So it is easy to center in the headphones on the channel.  Some other headphones using this system, have a tiny movement of the tuning wheel, going in then out of the correct frequency, making it very hard to center the frequency.  Not a problem with the RS120.  Auto turnon of the transmitter works fine, no cutoffs that some have reported, probably because my signal is high enough.  Good adjustment for head size, a little on the heavy side, but not uncomfortable. Have not noticed any interference from other wireless devices, so there is an advantage to keeping these headphones on the older 900 mhtz frequency.  Overall, I am very satisfied with them."
R2MDHLOBKJ2SIB,1,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle   .  The charger never worked. It is just not worth the problems of mailing back.
R2O6FGYUMC4JRN,4,I was researching what to buy and finally I settled on this. It was a right thing to do. We are very happy with this product.
R38CT4GQHW4RMQ,4,"I finally got fed up with tripping over wires at my desk every time I got up.  I often listen to internet radio or music while working, and also like to turn my chair around to look out the window while thinking about something.  This often led to my headphones wire getting tangled up in my chair and getting ripped off my head when I got up.  I have killed more than one set of headphones by them getting flung from my head to the ground or tearing off the connector.  I had been considering wireless headphones for a year or more before finally making this purchase.      One of the aspects of wireless headphones that I wanted to avoid was the need to replace batteries every week or so.  I am not good about keeping batteries handy, and would probably end up not using the headphone much because they would be out of juice.  The handy charging stand fixed this issue.    I have also been afraid of the dreading \\""hiss\\"" of wireless headphones.  While no audiophile, I am not a fan of white noise messing with my music.  I am happy to say that has not been an issue.  Every once in while, if I turn my head one exact way I get some static, but it is very minor.  Overall these headphones sound better and are more comfortable then the wired Sony MDR-NC6 headphones they are replacing.  The Sony headphones have noise canceling that works great, but for office use that is a bad thing.  You don't want to be too isolated at work.  I will keep the Sony set for airplane travel to cut the drone of the engines."
R11I6ZWBBELUGS,5,"Signal distance from base is phenomenal. Clarity of sound is great. All I expected and more. Shipping time was unreal, hardly time to process order and it was at my door."
R1MXDKH918Z3IM,3,"I was unhappy with these headphones because several times while watching TV the transmitter went off without reason, causing loud static in headphones.  Returned product very easily, received a credit to my account quickly, and will continue to buy from Amazon.  Usually I have no problems with products."
R1G3DK3QX9XYZH,4,"After reading mostly good reviews on this, I decided to buy it. Well, it does not disappoint.  On the first day of using it, there was this loud hissing noise whenever I moved my head fast.  After playing with the tuner a bit, that went away.  Somebody mentioned that he was getting interference from a treadmill.  That made me worry a bit because that was the main reason I bought this.  This never happened to me (so far). I think it has to do with the type of motor used.  I would not be surprised if a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner causes interference.     I am quite happy with the sound quality.  I am getting more high and low frequencies compared to what I hear from the TV's main speakers.  I am sure it would be even better if I connect it to my home theater system.  For $70, I am totally satisfied with its sound quality.  I am just waiting to see how long this quality lasts and how soon the batteries will go bad (stop taking charge).  Although, these standard AAA batteries are a big plus, because they are cheaper to replace.    A minor complain I have is charging the headphones. You'd really have to pay attention when placing the headphones on the base unit to make sure the contacts are touching and the charge light is lit.  Or you'd run of juice before you know it.  I also wish it a little smaller and lighter."
ROCK2F1NVPE3J,5,This product is GREAT.  I bought it for my mother as she has problem hearing TV.  Since the time I bought it she uses it everyday and loves it.  Great product.
RY371F3T82DNM,5,"I could not have selected a better set of wireless headphones. Great range (anywhere in the house & outside deck), sound is perfect & clear & it's rechargable."
R10C1J4KYM5WAK,5,"After reading numerous reviews, I chose these headphones and am glad I did.  I've got them hooked up to a 32\\"" lcd tv in the bedroom and the sound and clarity of the transmission has been second to none.  Comfortable, good stereo separation, and ease of manipulating the controls (once I got a feel for them) made for a good choice.  I've had them a few weeks, use them every evening, and really don't have anything negative to say about them.  For the money, a quality product."
R1WHX6F9WZO5CE,5,"My wife loves to listen to loud, bang-bang cops shows and movies.  It was driving me crazy.  The headphones have solved the problem and greatly improved the atmosphere in the house.  She can listen as load as she wants and I can read my book in quiet."
R27I4AJZHSYWE3,4,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless headphones about two months ago. The main use for these headphones were to not disturb my children while I play video games.    Pros:  Adequate padding on the ears and scalp  Battery compartment is easy to access  Design is visually pleasing  Charges quickly and stays charged for hours*  Good signal range  Volume setting allows for ear bleeding listening or whisper quiet    Cons:  Feels cheaply made compared to more expensive models  *Battery that comes with it doesn't hold a charge very long  Sound quality is okay at best    Overall, your getting what you pay for. If you want wireless headphones that have superb sound quality and are more durable you'll need to spend more money. But these are great wireless headphones for casual use.    *I replaced the provided battery with an Energizer rechargeable battery. It charges quicker and holds a charge longer. So far, I have had no issues using the Energizer rechargeable battery with the Sennheiser charging cradle."
R1Z7KTLL75ZYON,1,I tried for several hours on two TVs following all the directions and still static was all I could get out of the headphones. I sent them back!
R3F2UKKYMV7FJ8,5,Great product.  I love to watch musicals at night in my bedroom.  I don't have surround sound in my bedroom and the headphones make me feel like I do.  No Static at all.  Love them
RX0UF7Y147BYP,4,"We got these in 2005 and three years later they are holding up pretty well.    They still hold a charge well and the sound is fine.  The only issue is that the metal area at the top of the headphones that comes in contact with the charging stand gets extremely corroded over time.  It gets harder and harder to get the red light to come on indicating that it is recharging.  Scraping off the corrosion seems to help, but it would be better if the charger connected differently so this didn't happen.      They are surprisingly durable and have survived numerous drops on a hard floor."
R3UGZ7W8EWETXY,4,"Got this for my husband to listen to in bed since he \\""forgets\\"" to turn off the TV after he falls asleep.  It does need to be \\""tweeked\\"" (via the tuner) every now and again, and the base needs to be several feet away from the television, but overall it's a great product."
R1XUYJWSXMFENB,3,"I gave these headphones an average rating because the price is good for a wireless set, and at times the sound quality is good.  Signal reception is not a problem, but for some reason, they have an AGC that cranks up the gain whenever there is not a lot of input drive.  I had to max out all my line out levels, and still on slower songs without a lot of background sound, the noise level (static) comes up.  When listening to songs with a constant bass line, the sound quality is terrific, but on more instrumental stuff, the hissing can be unbearable."
R15MCAVTGUD2KX,4,"Sound quality gets 4 stars.  No ear drum rattling bass but overall tone is in the acceptable range.    Durability still undecided.    Comfort / wear-ability gets 4 stars.  Phones are large wont fit any pinhead(s) - - no offense intended to any pinheads out there!    Has a relaxed feel and are comfortable.    Output Range gets 4.5 stars.  Excellent line of sight and above par through obstructions.  Many here complain of interference but RF is RF and it's going to happen, I've heard/had alot worse. Close range is crystal clear.  More volume from source and less volume at headphones will eliminate hiss.    Control layout / design gets 3.5 stars.  My peeve is the volume dial is placed above the fine tuning dial.  IMHO it should have been the other way.  Base unit/charger was well thought out and suits its' purpose.    Bottom Line:  On sale item is worth it, doubt I'd pay full price."
RW01GI63JB6D4,1,"The sound is supurb with this unit... but i'm not sure if its just my house, but every 10 -15 minutes, the headset would drift frequency and get static.  Also, the instuctions that came with it, did not even mention there was a switch on the base to change freq ranges.. this did help some, but still did not stop the drifting.  I have returned unit."
R14BM1VYC25W2E,3,"I bought these headphones for listening to music around the house. The base response is so poor they are realy only good for watching tv.  The headphones work fine, the charging system works well, the broadcast range is very good.  However, the sound quality and dynamic response is nothing to brag about.  If your intention is to watch tv or a movie then I would say this is a good buy.  If you are looking for a good acuostical experience, I would say look elsewhere."
RFF8WZ98BERXM,4,"I have used these headphones exclusively to watch TV and play video games while my son is sleeping. The headphones work great, and allow me complete freedom of movement, versus the long headphone extension cable I used to use. The first time I used them, it took a couple of minutes to select just the right frequency for minimum noise, but I haven't had to play with the settings since. My only gripe would be the automatic volume adjustment feature that can't be turned off. When I play video games or watch DVDs, whenever I hit a menu or some other section with no sound, the headphones try to compensate by increasing the gain, which results in a buzzing sound. It's a minor irritation, and the buzzing immediately goes away when the source sound returns, but I wish I could turn off this feature."
R2K44OQ95LPZ53,1,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]  I read many reviews this morning pertaining to this product, and many were positive.I agreed, to an extent, with most of the complimentary reviews, but I must say this headphone was literally a headache, or maybe I should say ear aching device for me. I could only have these on for twenty to thirty- minutes and my ears began to pain me, and then if that wasn't enough, my ears began to itch considerably.  If I paused my DVR for several minutes and I return and put the headphones on there is no TV signal only the sound of rushing air. Eventually the sound returned to normal.  I prefer to praise then to criticize. Two things I can say positive about this product was the audio was very good and the cradle that you hung the headphone on for recharging was excellent."
R72CQVUNNA5KF,4,These headphones were comfortable for extended use. They were easy to install and they provided decent sound quality and volume considering they were wireless. Definitely served the purpose providing acceptable sound reproduction for a senior citizen with hearing problems making television watching more enjoyable.
R2PWILW1E6DDFS,5,"These cordless headphones have a great sound, great price, and allow me to move around the office with complete freedom.  No more damaged cords to cause distortion.  Thanks Sennheiser ... and Amazon.com!"
R8G8ZQ9F9KHYZ,5,"I hesitated to purchase any kind of hearing assistance for watching TV for many reasons but finally broke down and ordered the Sennheiser RS 120 wireless RF headphones after heated discussions with my spouse.  I was unaware that I could listen independent of the volume of the TV audio with a wireless system.  Well, they work just fine.  Now my spouse and I can both enjoy the TV at the volume of our choice independent from one another's preference.  The Sennheiser 120 system is cheap and a good value.  I can hear the TV in every room of the house and out in the yard.  And further, I can now listen in stereo whereas my spouse gets the usual monotone blast.  Highly recommended for the borderline hearing impaired."
R2FEXK2E39TPZ7,5,"I painstakingly searched every electronic store for quality and price.  These Sennheiser HDR120 headphones have great sound, great range, great battery life, and are as comfortable as any wireless headphones that I have owned.  They will fall off your head if you abruptly put your head down but all wireless headphones that I have owned have done that. A couple very brief static interruptions very rarely as with any wireless headphone, nothing to effect my love of these headphones.  Hope this helps."
R3NX6J36QR5VFX,5,"I am hard of hearing and I have had wireless head phones in the past and paid much more than this. These are the clearest and easiest to use I have found. I especially like the wall mount which allows the unit to be hung in an out of the way place that does not take up any table space.  I have worn mine in side and outside my house, I have to go to a neighbors house before The signal drops out. No interference, no distortion, They are not significant noise canceling so if my wife speaks,(not too softly) I can still hear her, or hear conversation in the room when watching TV. They are extremely easy to hang up for charging. No additional charge wire to connect. these are great. PS: There is one set up adjustment(frequency) that I wonder if some of the less flattering reviewers adjusted."
R29CLKX6LU8T21,4,"I am very pleased with this product. I have a hearing problem and by using these head phones without my hearing aids, I understand the words coming from the Tv better than with or without my hearing aids. Now I can listen  to TV or audio disks without having it too loud for others in the room. Also, I can have audio with my TV programs while my wife is sleeping. Not all programs have captions. Before getting the rf wireless headphones I had to depend on captions.                                                    P.B."
R16H8BQMG62YIQ,2,I do not believe my head is smaller than your average person.Yet. the bloody headphones keep falling off my head. There does not appear that there is any way to make an adjustment. I am really miffed.
R2SEGQZN3X3B4U,1,"We could not be more unhappy with this product. It does not help that they are comfortable to wear (and we find they are) because they are uncomfortable to listen to. Intolerable really.  These headphones were a waste of money. They hiss and buzz and whine pretty much all the time, on all channels. I've read the other reviews where people were talking about this happening when they were 10-20 feet from the base. Well, we live in a tiny NY apartment and you can't GET 10 feet from the base in our living room, and still we have interference. we get the hissing sitting RIGHT IN FRONT OF the base. There are two positions on our couch (3 feet from base) from which there is a clean signal, and you must hold your head in EXACTLY one of those positions (don't turn it, raise it, lower it) at all. It reminds me of the horrors of trying to make the old style rabbit ear antennae work and having to have them \\""just so\\"". I certainly can't use them while I walk about the room. We've tried all the troubleshooting tips (they recommend placing the base as far from cables and other electricals as possible - well there's only so far you can go with such short leads) and nothing helps one bit. The last straw was last night, I actually hurt my neck trying to keep my head in the right place for the signal to be clean.   Perhaps it is something about being in Manhattan, with alot of other interfering signals around, but whatever the cause of our woes, I regret this purchase utterly and would not recommend this item to anyone. We will have to just write it off and go buy something else."
RGBAAJ81OI08E,5,"I bought these headphones and charging base for myself a couple of years ago.  The quality is outstanding!  I just recently bought another set for my wife at a terrific Amazon price.  We now have two great headphone units and a spare charging base.  I am not an audiophile, just an old man who can't hear the tv at the volume which my wife prefers.  So this product keeps our home happy.  Thanks Sennheiser and Amazon!"
R3E4Z7YSAPP5TL,4,"I didn't have high expectations when ordering these wireless headphones from Sennheiser, but was pleasantly surprised by their fidelity, quality, and overall design. Unlike experiences noted by other reviewers, these headphones came with the RCA adaptors that apparently were missing in the past. The quality of sound is pretty decent, with a low-level, high frequency hiss that is only noticeable at high volume levels."
R1OBTFVR3VT0CE,5,These were a Christmas gift for my husband.  He uses them while in bed and I am trying to sleep.  The sound is great.  He absolutely loves them.
R1TTCV5274SDRJ,1,"These are horrible to set up and use.  Tons of static and even after hours of tuning, I could not get them to work in a satisfactory manner.  When I did have them on my head, they never fell off and although the pads are foam and not leatherette, they were comfortable.  Unfortunately, comfort means nothing if all you get is static.      The Amazon experience was also ugly - the order did not ship for a month, and when I returned it, I had to call them after several weeks to ask where the refund was."
RUX1WD1I7ME4Q,5,"These headphones are extremely comfortable, and have great sound.  Charger works great and the range is amazing.  Amazon's price was the best.  After comparing all the other models, the Sennheiser RS120 is the best value of all the Sennheiser models."
R1BVOJC2IMQAQF,4,"These phones worked great right out of the box.  I use them for my computer, flight sims and music.  They are suprisingly light weight and comfortable.  Some reviews may say that they turn off for no apparrent reason, but I've found that if the source volume is too low then its the same as having no signal.  Remedy:  Turn up the source volume and turn down the head phone volume.  Yes, these head phones have separate volume controls as well as a frequency switch on the base and a tuning wheel on the headset in case you need to fine tune to get rid of any interference.  I've had the head phones for about three months now, and given the quality construction of this set, I expect to use them for years.  Good buy for sure.  When I bought them the price was $69."
R2FSJW6XU6UCI8,4,"I had recently decided that due to apartment complex living, I needed a way to stop playing TV and stereo volume games with my downstairs neightbor. After much searching I decided on these Sennheiser RS120 Wireless headphones with charger. They were easy to set up, are extremely comfortable (I can wear them for hours!), and the sound is great.<br /><br />I relied heavily on other reviews, and found they were right on. If you are looking for a noise canceling headphone, these are not for you. I can enjoy my television or music without the loud tv from the neighbor downstairs interfereing too much, but there is still some ambient noise if their TV is really loud. As for quality of sound, they are fine. If you are a music junkie, the sound is not the quality you are probably looking for, but it isn't horrible either. These are not for someone who wants to emerse themselves in a rich musical tapestry, I have other headphones for that. They are perfect for watching tv or listening to music while you clean and the sound quality is better than average.<br /><br />Sometimes a bit of buzz is audible, and moving around my apartment I will sometimes get a buzzing surge, but it's a wireless headphone and things interfere in close living quarters. The charging cradle is great too. It is small and doesn't call attention to itself in your decor.<br /><br />I am definately happy with these headphones and have recommended them to friends and family."
R2VCYTGB11DFAD,5,"These headphones have saved my sanity! My poor dear 94 year old mother-in-law who lives with me is very hard of hearing. We have tried many other products and they would all produce \\""feedback\\"" for her or were to complicated to install or use. She now enjoys TV without blasting the rest of out of the house or the neighbors! The only draw back for her is that she cannot adjust the 3 dials for headphones, those fingers just don't work that way anymore! Now I am thinking of buying a second pair for my husband!!!"
RNC4FTQ96068V,5,"I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AND HOOKED IT UP AND IT WORKS GREAT. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT. NO STATIC, GREAT BUY."
R1K8VTP5U8E1G9,5,"They work wonderfully through out my whole house.  I definitely recommend them. The sound quality is  excellent, although there are sometimes short pops  and crackle when I walk around, but these are minimal  considering the flexibility they provide."
R3DIQ7YFVDWNRW,5,"We just finished our basement and have some workout equipment by the TV by the furnace.  Whenever the furnace kicked on, I would have to crank up the TV volume so high, it interfered with my husband's music in the basement bedroom.  Even though I still have to turn up the volume on the headphones when the furnace comes on, it does not affect the volume on the TV so my husband can record music or listen to music without TV interference.  This was a good purchase for us."
R3TC4DRA9JJNX2,5,"This is the second pair of these wireless headphones I've purchased.  I get clear steady audio reception and can listen to my pc, tv, dvd or cd as loud as I want without bothering anyone.  Great!  The headphone jack plug makes it soooo easy to go from pc to tv etc.  Highly recommended."
R2QMI779VQZWTW,4,"I purchased this product because I live in an apt building with very thin walls and I am very sensitive to music from loud neighbors. When I am in my apt I just want to hear my own noise and no one else's. These headphones do just that. I have to say the the sound quality of the headphones is excellent....very clear and crisp. The directions for getting everything set up are quite poor but fortunately intuitive. The actual headphones are big and clunky so its hard to lay down on your side with them on. Also, the volume button is poorly placed as mentioned in previous reviews. Finally, I have a DVR box that is separate from my DVD player so I can only use the headphones for one or the other. The sound quality is so great i'd like to listen while watching dvds but its just too much trouble to poke around and unplug and replug to get everything set up. Fortunately, we are moving to a house soon but I can see using them for other purposes once we move. I would recommend this product! Regarding picking up extraneous noises such as neighbors phone calls...i've only had that problem when I tried to use them for noise canceling purposes (i.e. my television was off and I turned the headphones on hoping to hear white noise)."
R3TX6RZ7CASC5L,5,"I recently upgraded to a Sony HDTV and needed some wireless headphones to go with it.  My previous Sony TV had a pair of wireless headphones that synced up wirelessly with the TV without an external receiver or anything.  When I upgraded, I lost and deeply missed that function.  My wife is on a different work/sleep schedule than I am, so I needed a way to be able to watch TV without having to keep the volume down really low and sit like 2 inches from the screen to be able to hear it.  After comparing several brands of wireless headphones online, it seemed that the Sennheiser headphones had higher review ratings than other big name brands like Sony.  After doing some further comparisons on price, I found that Amazon was selling the headphones I wanted for about $50 less than the local Large Chain Retailer (Best Buy).    After making the purchase and hooking the headphones up, I have been completely pleased with this product.  With my setup, I have the wireless receiver hooked into the headphone port of my surround sound receiver.  I can turn the volume of the TV down to Zero, and then turn up the surround sound and slap on the headphones and listen without disturbing anyone.    The wireless range is very broad, and I can walk throughout my entire house and still get a good reception (with only minimal static interference).  There are 3 different wireless settings on the base of the wireless receiver (possibly 3 different frequencies).  By adjusting the base and then using the tuning wheel on the headphones, you can fine tune the clarity of your signal and minimize any distortion/intereference.  Other reviews I have read talk about a background noise/hiss when using the headphones.  I have found that by turning up the volume on my cable box and on the headphones and then turning down the volume of my surround sound receiver, I get a near perfect signal without any background noise or hiss.  This may be different for people with other setups, but I am very picky when it comes to audio/video quality and I have not been disappointed with this product.     The one knock I have on this product is that it has an on/off switch on the headphones that is easy to forget to turn off (which is more a problem with me than with the headphones).  My last pair of wireless headphones had a sensor strap that would tell the headphones to turn on when you had them on your head.  Having grown accustomed to that feature, it makes it very easy to forget to flip the headphones off when I'm not using them.    Overall, this is a great product.  Again, different setups may yield different results but with my setup, these headphones have performed beyond my expectations and I would definitely make the same decision to purchase them again if I had to do it all over again."
R38XWK71EZ5BCN,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]    I DID NOT EXPECT THE RICH SOUND AND CLARITY THIS UNIT PROVIDES. INTENDED FOR TV LISTENING LATE AT NIGHT I NOW USE FOR MUSIC.  IT HAS WONDERFUL TONE QUALITY AND A RICH BACKGROUND BASE. WHAT IS MOST IMPRESSIVE IS ITS SUPERIOR CLARITY OF VOICE AND NO DEAD AIR HISS OR RUSHING SOUNDS. I RATE THE COMFORT LEVEL AT 8.5 ON A SCALE OF TEN, ONLY BECAUSE I TEND TO REST MY HEAD BACK AGAINST THE PILLOW AND THE HEAD BAND MOVES SLIGHTLY FORWARD. IT CHARGES EASILY ENOUGH GREEN BASE LIGHT INDICATOR GOES OUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED, RED BASE LIGHT REMAINS ON ALWAYS.  I FOUND THE VOLUME CONTROL WHEEL JUST A TAD LOW TO ADJUST IT COULD STICK UP A TINY BIT MORE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT WIRELESS HEAD SET LOOK NO FURTHER, I HAVE A THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE SONY WIRED PAIR OF HEADPHONES THAT DON'T SOUND A SGOOD AS THESE."
R2IJ34V6BNWSYE,4,PROS:  Excellent sound quality.  Controls work well and do what they are supposed to do.  Recharging cradle is very convient and easy to use.  Hours of use on a charge are good.  No exact test but I used them for two or three nights of TV on a single charge.  Excellent range...works at least 3 rooms away from base.      CONS:  These are relatively heavy and do become tiresome after a couple of hours of use.  They also fit tightly on the ears which because of the weight becomes slightly uncomforatble after awhile.  I use a headrest so I let the phones go around the back of my head and therefore the weight doesn't bother me as much.  Also the fact that I wear glasses may make the fit seem tighter to me.      OVERALL:  They do what I wanted and they look and feel like a quality product.
R2J7R1NHG5BEE,4,"I recently purchased this item for my wife, who is a bit of an insomniac. We have gone through four sets of wireless headphones in less than three years.  All the previous sets were purchased at Radio Shack for quite a bit more than we paid for this set.  The shipping time was awesome, and my wife started using them as soon as the box came.  She is extremely happy with the clarity of sound, and unlike other reviews I have read, does not hear any \\""buzz\\"". I get to sleep peacefully without earplugs, and she hasn't yet needed to switch out the rechargeable batteries. They last the whole night through, over 12hrs at a time.  We are extremely glad we purchased these headphones, and I would recommend them over any of the slightly less expensive brands offered on this site.  I could only wish there was a back strap to keep the headphones from falling off if you lean forward, but a small strip of fabric sewn around the back has taken care of this problem for us.  That's my only gripe."
RUAS4M7Y3SGAJ,1,"Overall, this product has performed less than hoped.  To charge, the metal contacts on the headphone has to make good contact with the base unit.  In order for my unit to make good contact, I've had to weigh down the headphone by putting a weighted object on top of it.  It's been a frustrating experience.  Also, as some reviewers have pointed out, the unit goes out of tune quite frequently.  Recently, the unit started giving a periodic loud static sound."
R6ZYU1C9ASDZY,5,"This is the forth set of these headphones that I ordered for friends. Two of the four of us wear hearing aids and appreciate the great bass response that we get with hearing aids out. We are all hooked up the same way, audio output from the TV. This way our spouses can listen to TV at normal listening levels, while we can enjoy loud, clear, amazing sound."
R15COLPX3Q12W1,3,"I would definitely recommend the Sennheiser rs 120s to anyone who watches T.V. with them because they deliver great sound quality, and a range that is truly amazing. I walked all the way down my street and I still got a good signal! But now for the reason this product gets three stars. Some people say that the phones are much smaller than they look in the picture. In fact, they are much, much larger. They aren't heavy, but the ear pieces are GIGANTIC. My main problem, though, is that they do not work portably with iPod. What you do not see in the picture is that there is a wire that comes out of the base that connects to a device that has a headphone jack. That connects to the iPod headphone port. So technically the Senns do work with the iPod, but you cannot travel with them. You couldn't travel with them anyway because they are so darn big! As another reviewer said, I really wanted to like these headphones because the sound quality was great and the range was unbelievable. But in the end, there were two key flaws-the size and the lack of portability-that made these headphones very disappointing at best."
RSM6FLNKRS6TO,5,brought these xmas 2007 for my husband and he loves them...uses them all the time inside and out....good product according to him :)
R23PTR8UV94VU0,4,"Sound quality is good and clear.  Any static that can be heard is generated by the TV or Stereo or the connection and not the head phones.  Although it may seen somewhat bulky, the headphone are reasonable in weight and its size  should not be compared with wired models.  The volume and tone controls are sensitive.  Overall great piece of audio equipment."
RT1134RGUE8FG,5,"I've owned three sets of headphones in the past, I use them to listen to TV. These are by far the best. You do have to be careful to get them placed correctly on the charger but the same holds for other brands. Would definitely recommend the Sennheiser headphones. They cost a little more but are worth it."
R3DV89GWNTGYBY,5,"I bought these for my father for Christmas.  He loves them.  Excellent clarity, works well from room to room.  He uses them when he works out so the TV does not have to be blaring, he said he hears so much more of what is on TV.  I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting wireless headphones for working out or just watching TV.  My dad does have a little bit of a hearing problem as well, so it is good for someone that has trouble hearing.  Also, very easy to use, it was very simple to set up and start using."
R2SE9LHP58Y5P8,4,"Sound is great.  They are comfortable and do alright as long you are sitting still. Get up and move around, they feel like they are going to fall off. Look up or down and they will fall off."
R2EXPTPNC7N5IK,5,"I was afraid to buy these headphones because of the reviews that were negative. THE PHONES ARE GREAT. I have a hearing deficit and the phones are as crisp, clear and rich. I'm getting HD sound. The issue is that the \\""Tuning Wheel\\"" on the phones is not a bass/treble devise but a fine tuning of the radio signal from the base. Turn this little dial until the reception is clear and strong. The instructions say nothing about the tuning wheel. The receiver problems has nothing to do with all the recommended technical solutions, as far as I can tell. I have the transmitter sitting in the middle of a bunch of wires and there is no problem."
R11TJ95CFZ7I6F,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]] I purchased this headset for my 82 year old father, who wears hearing aids.  He complained that it amplified certain bass notes, which he found irritating because of his hearing loss. I would not recommend this headset for anyone with moderate to severe hearing loss.  It is not a substitute for a TV listening device, such as TV Ears. I, on the other hand, have no hearing problems and I was extremely pleased by the beautiful, clear sound.  I now have it hooked up to my stereo so that I may listen to smooth jazz in the evenings and not disturb anyone else in the household.  It is great for listening to music as you move from room to room in the house--and even works outside, all around the yard.  I especially look forward to listening to music in my outdoor sitting area this summer!"
R1HATM2IDMFC2Y,5,"These headphones work very well.  The sound quality is very good.  There are more expensive products with greater features, but for the money, a good choice.        There is an on/off switch located on the left earpiece.  I have a Sony pair which will automatically shut off when you remove them from your head, but the Sennheiser requires you to flick the switch.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
R1X41T1IE616I6,5,"For several years I denied that my sense of hearing diminished due to old age.  This headphone solved the problem.  The only thing I find annoying is that the volume of the TV must be turned up enough so that the headphones can pick up the signal. But the volume required doesn't disturb others in the house who prefer to sleep. My pet gripe is that actors on nearly all TV dramas seem to think that moving one's lips and pronouncing their lines distinctly is unrealistic.  Then, the sound recorder dubs in the background music too loud realtive to the actors' mumblings. Also, when commercials come on, you have to adjust the headphones volume. But you can't have your sound and hear it too."
R2AB293CFRTHYF,4,"Started out OK, but next day no output from right speaker. Amazon replaced it in one day! Great service. The second set works great.  Can't beat it for the price and Amazon's service."
R1HD0JQQ8ISAES,4,"I bought this so that I could get some sleep.   My wife likes to watch tv after I have gone to bed.   Nice easy to use unit...good reception.    However, your tv must have a jack (for headphones) or you will have to install switches to shut off the speakers on the tv.   This product will work well with tv speakers off but tv volume up to 3/4.   Otherwise the unit will not work properly.  Hope this is helpful."
R3QJ1IH7KOMRE8,4,"Overall I have been extremely pleased with this product. It is very easy to use, I like the fact that is has a rechargeable base so it is always ready to go, and the sound is good. I also like the ability to adjust the volume from the headset. My only complaint is that I use them to do household chores and I can't lean forward or they slip forward (tightening doesn't help). I think adding an extra strap around the back would solve the problem, just haven't gotten around to it yet! I am able to get good reception everywhere in our 2-story house."
R3Q79OMR93YQXW,5,worked great for four years .... will buy them again ... nice and clear sound ... wished if they were a bit more reasonably priced
RLONFKK0L61GF,4,"I listen to music through my computer at work, and got sick of my wired headphones getting caught in the chair and/or flying off of my head when rolling to the other side of my cube.  This product was the perfect fix.  The sound quality is very good most of the time; once in a while I hear some feedback, but it is worth the freedom of being able to stand up, walk away from my desk, spin in my chair, or whatever, without having to take the headphones off!    Another small issue I have noticed is when I have them on all day, my ears start to get sore.  Maybe my noggin is just too large.  Usually it's not an issue because I take them off before heading to a meeting - but when I'm lucky and have a meeting-free day, I find myself taking them off to rest my ears.      Overall, the product seems to be well-worth the price.  I purchased a less-expensive pair of wireless headphones a couple of years ago, and returned them the next day due to the sound quality."
R30MA7NRKQBSND,5,Thank You Very Much! Smooth Transaction! I'm using it for VCR and DVD players. Sennheiser Wireless RF Headphones RS120 works great! Amazon works great!
R2FKD0TKL6WGLL,2,"We have a RS130 that we bought couple years back and love it, we bought this down grade version RS120 for other TV room thinking it should work the same for $ 30 less..we were wrong...The headphone was not as comfortable as the RS130, the size or curve can not be adjusted the way RS130 works, it kept falling off our head. The volume & tuner bottoms are \\""wheel turning type\\"", you can easyly loose your frequency if you just scratch your ear or simply by turning your head, and to tune back to the right frequency is a big challege, the stalics is constant, the volume is not consistant, one side is so much louder than the other one (they are design like this, but this one is way off the scale), The charges works just like the RS130. Only thing I like is saving you $30 buck, but I can not get though the tuner button( RS130 is push button), so we return it the next day and got ourself another RS130."
R2RWI3R7P490CY,2,"Product had too much interference in my apartment when I got about 50 ft away.  Also, and this is a personal reaction, I found the phones heavy and bulky.  I returned them."
R1FMZ6B8D882GM,5,"I required headphones to satisfy my constant need for stimulus while my wife needs total quiet to study. She can sit only feet away and not be bothered by the TV's sound that is well contained in these over-the-ear cans. This was the reason for our purchase. We are now enjoying the many other benefits of these great headphones - we can walk from room to room and not miss a thing. My wife loves being able to use them while cooking away - pots and pans banging loudly trying to compete, but the Sennheisers win. I have purchased Sennheiser decades before, and remember being a happy consumer. Glad I purchased Sennheiser again. I am still a happy consumer. I am an audiophile, and after a lot of research, My review should carry some weight, regardless to lack of description. I found this set was the perfect solution. We made a good choice."
R2LS6NEJ59KG9L,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle]]  Easy setup. Easy recharge. Light weight. Great sound.   I an listen to music or TV while my wife reads or talks on the phone. Phone rings, I put these on as she mutes the TV.  Good price for RF"
R17ONG6BVKR80N,2,"Well...you have to be careful with this purchase.  You need to know how it will operate with your other hardware (e.g. TV, computer) .  Unfortunately, these headphones cannot stay in tune no matter how close the headset is to the base.  When it works, the sound is great. However, the interference from my TV ruins this purchase.  What a shame..."
REIAL8PKW0CLW,2,"I own the RS120 and a extra headset HDR120. I find both headphone sets to be very uncomfortable very quickly. I also own a Radio Shack wireless headphone set that is installed on another TV. The earphone cushions are big soft and fit over the ear, will stay on while you exercise, and they are comfortable for hours.  The RS120/Hdr120 on the ear headphones begin to hurt almost immediately. The sound quality is great, but the ear cushions are ultra thin.  Additionally, if you want product support by phone, be ready for a challenge."
RR8PIAX81ADBX,4,"SENNNHEISER RS 120 HEADPHONES ARE ALMOST PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS. ONLY ONE PROBLEM AND THAT IS I CANNOT GET ANY SOUND OUT OF HEADPHONES WHEN TV IS BROADCASTING IN HD. I CAN ,IF I JUST GO TO TV ON THE HD CHANNEL HEAR CLEARLY. CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT TO MAKE THEM PICK UP AUDIO WHEN WATCHING IN HD...."
RFWPY7YVSPBXG,5,"I was skeptical that these or any wireles headphones would really give a clear signal and sound good. These do both. I went into every room of my house while wearing them, and even went outside into the back yard, and there was no signal loss whatever. Sound quality is very good, though not quite as good as a corded set. But hey, these cost 70 bucks and let you roam wherever you want. I'm completely satisfied with them."
R1GQF20Y0CR1HW,3,"Product works. Instructions were TERRIBLE. Instructions were on 4 separate pieces of paper, had to piece everything together. A lot of guessing for the set up. Didn't say to charge the headset needed to be on the stand. The charge light does not always come on when you put the headphones on the stand. We didn't realize that you have to quick turn your TV on mute to use them. Over all the product works with a little futzing around, but it wasn't all that intuitive."
R13IPM08U17IA6,3,"Every three minutes the  sound cuts out and there is a blaxt of static.  Totally unsatisfactory performance notwithstanding the price.  There is no way to contact the manufacturer to deal with the problem.  Others have mentioned the problem and it is surprising the company continues to market the product in the circumstances.  The headphones are very difficult to tune, the on/off switch is superfulous and the audio jack is too short for some applications.  All in all a so-so product.    Ron Gunning"
R4EA8KWT2PU4F,4,Got these headphones a couple of weeks ago and I'm very happy with it so far. Sometimes (even without moving much) I notice a static crackle but it's barely noticeable and not distracting. Range is pretty good!
R3I0A4D7OTPSUR,5,worked great and the distance it worked at was wonderful we use it at church so a hard of hearing lady can hear the services we hooked in to the tape output on the speaker system
R19HV1AG1V9TO3,1,"I am an audio artist and DJ. These headphones may have been damaged out of the box, because they were one of the worst sounding headphones I have ever experienced. They were distorted and seemed to never tune-in properly. They were tinny and had no low end at all which is a must, as I purchased these phones for DJ announcing. I have owned other Sennheiser studio headphones and they were great.    With the very strong possibility these headphones were not damaged, I didn't even bother to try another pair, because I was already convinced of their inferiority."
R1MIMFKN77G3JY,5,I've had the RS 120 headphones for a few weeks now. I move them back and forth between two TV's and they work perfectly. I got them because my hearing is diminishing and I couldn't hear the television when my wife had the volume at a level that is comfortable for her. I don't hear any hiss at at any time and I've walked further than 150 feet from the base with no change in sound quality. I'm not an audiophile but with these I can appreciate music much more than before because I can hear things I was missing. I highly recommend this product.
R2IFPPV12F1RMC,5,"For the price, I am quite satisified with these wireless headphones. The sound is great and they are confortable. I have had several unsatisfactory run-ins with other wireless headphones from Radio Shaft in the same price range, and these beat anything at a comparable price. It is true there is a little white noise when the volume is low, but even to my senstive and very picky ears, it is definitely acceptable. Here's the way I see it... If you are looking for perfect sound, but wired headphones...if you are looking to spend twice the money, they you will be even happier with something that costs twice as much. If you are looking for good sounding,  comfortable headphones at a low price, then you are looking at the right product."
R3T6DLLXQJQN3M,5,"I have had the headphones for about a month now and so far I am very pleased. I use them mostly while watching DVD's on my computer. I have also used them for streaming radio. They are very comfortable, even after several hours of constant use. The sound seems very good to me with good lows and highs and good stereo separation. The sound quality and especially the range is much better than several bluetooth sets that I have tried. I keep the headset on the charging cradle when not in use so I have not had any battery issues yet. Time will tell how long the batteries will keep recharging.    The only complaints I could come up with is the volume and tuning controls on the right earpiece are very small and hard to adjust (at least for me). Also, the headset feels a bit loose on my head, which probably makes it more comfortable, but it tends to fall off sometimes when I bend over."
R15XMMLMLSKLP9,4,"Great product and service.  Even though there was problem with UPS delivery,  it was rectified and corrected quickly."
R25EF2S53ND3LH,4,"The RS120 headphones are pretty nice for what they are.  In my home, you will find my infant son who goes to bed at 7:30.  Meanwhile, daddy likes to stay up late while playing Call Of Duty 4 on Xbox without waking up the little monster.<br /><br />They work well for what I use them for.  They were easy enough to setup out of the box, not much tweaking needed to dial in the best sound.  I personally do not like analog tuners, but this headset does have a tuner dial to help tweak the reception.  I would prefer specific \\""channels\\"" to put the base and / or headset on, but I can live with the analog dial.  Turning your head or moving around may yield some slight static attenuation.  My primary usage has been about a ten foot distance from the base.<br /><br />Speaking of the base, it is very light.  Much lighter than the headphones, so it has a tendency to tip over when you are placing the headphones on the base.  I would recommend mounting the base on a wall so it is firmly secured.<br /><br />I have worn more comfortable headphones, but these aren't bad for medium to long gaming sessions or movies.  The headphone cups press against the ear and do not fit around the ear.  This is fine for me, as I need to be able to hear my son if he wakes up.  However, if I were looking for total sound isolation and comfort, I would prefer a headphone with complete ear coverage.  Since they press against the ear, they can become uncomfortable after a longer than normal (3+ hour) usage period.<br /><br />Before I made the purchase, my wife questioned the need for headphones.  Now that she has used them as well, she wants me to order a set for her.  Luckily for her, I can order another pair of headphones that will work with this base so we both can enjoy the same audio source.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably one of the best wireless headphone kits you can get for this amount of coin.  The *really* good ones cost 6-8x as much, and only marginally increase sound quality and / or comfort.  To me, that's beyond the point of diminishing returns.  This kit has amazing value.  Plus they are Sennheiser cans, so you know the quality and attention to detail is there.iminishing returns.  This kit has amazing value.

RWXCLK6P7PINC,5,"I was very pleased with this product.  Easy to set up.  Beautiful sound.  Comfortable headset.  What more could I ask for?    All in all, it exceeds expectations."
R1K2PBYMJTT91Q,2,"This is the first time a do a review about an item. I had not problem from amazone.com, even I got it before the time I was waiting for.   The headphones were refurbished. So after following instructions and waiting more than 24 hours for batteries to charge, it did not work. I returned it and the new one the same thing. So I went to the store and got new batteries and still did not charge after 24 hours charging. So I figured this product has a problem with the charger, so I bought my own charger and finally I made it work this way, so I had to spent about $20more dollars that I paid for the charger and batteries just to make them work.  The sound quality is not the best. Also when you are on bed watching TV they are so big and you get tire of one position and you can't even turn side ways to listen to./Also they are so big that after a while make you hot just to have them for too long.    If I were you I would spend some more money and buy smallers headphones with better sound.  Thanks  Harvey"
R1IAAOHHIY1Z6J,5,Very easy to install and use. Crystal clear audio. So convenient to use throughout the house and around the yard without disturbing others. Comfortable to wear.
R2PNJJ72MIC00I,5,"These headphones work great. Other reviews have stated they hear interference when listening or a buzz when charging....I hear nothing to the sort with mine. Maybe try to relocate the base? I also bought a second pair so someone can hear at their suond level. Both work great with a great range. I've tried two other brands of headphones and this blows them out of the water by far. The main headphones don't come with rechargeable batteries as the box indicates...the extra headphones do. I use them with a TV. For those using with a stereo, I don't know how you'd enjoy them if you're picky about your sounds, but you will get crisp reception. Would recommend and buy again if needed."
R3FQOSCZ9F870T,4,"I purchased this for my husband, who is hard of hearing.  He has a hearing aid, but this wireless headphone is SO much better.  He said he can understand everything they are saying on the TV. He enjoys using it very much, with no problems."
R3FKBKTGDLMNL9,5,i read other reviews before i purchased. i'd never heard of sennheiser. i'm very pleased. they were very easy to connect to my tv. the range is wonderful. i can even go outside. they will also work with the tv off if you turn it off while in another area of the house. i highly recommend this product.
R2JFN1Z73Q8QTM,4,"I bought this to keep from waking the wife when I was watching TV in the next room.  It's fairly comfortable, has good range (at least within our house) and it's a snap to set up.  I was especially impressed with the magnetic grip on the charging base that makes sure it's snug against the terminals.  The only downside to the headphones is the interference.  There is always a little background hiss, and these are definately NOT build for high-quality audio(even though they have a pretty good bass reproduction).  When I listen to events without a lot of loud noise (think Golf announcing), the hissing is clearly audible.  When I listen to louder chanels it almost disappears behind the audio.    All in all, I would definately recommend these for someone that needs an entry level solution for keeping the noise down around the house.  I would definately buy these again, and when my headphones for my computer break, I just might!"
R3MLHIMS2NEEBZ,4,"I'm very happy with these.  I bought them to use on my treadmill and they work wonderfully for that.  They hum when plugged into my TV, which is elderly, but not when attached to the DVD player.  I wondered if it was the adaptor (included.  worth a star) but when plugged into my computer through the adaptor it does not hum.  Not entirely sure how to address this long term.  But thinking."
R1UCQSG054C7ZS,3,"I bought this model almost 2 years ago. It worked fine, pretty comfortable on the head, though we had to change frequencies sometimes. The batteries lasted all this time, but gradually the volume of sound had to be increased at the source (TV). Headphones stopped working abruptly, only horrible noise and interference were heard. I changed the batteries as I thought this was the reason, but it did not help. Checked the company website for warranty info, there is a minimum $35 evaluation charge. I would rather buy a new set which costs $65 now. I expected more from this company, honestly, where is the famous german quality? Product made in China however."
R2MAPZ41DHYX05,5,"Before my purchase of the 120 on Amazon I did mucho research and read a ton of reviews. You might have thought I was looking for a wife. The first thing that impressed me was these phones were  numero uno in THREE catagories on Amazon.    I have a hearing problem and use the closed captions along with sound when watching TV, so I was looking for anything that would improve my aural experience.    I was concered about the possible hissing sound I might encounter but I found I could eliminate it in short order by experimenting with volume source and fine tuning.    As I write this review I am listening to a cable music channel on my TV and I am one happy camper. Sounds real good.    I have tried using these cans with the television speakers turned off and just having the sound come through the phones and also with the speakers on at a moderate level.  I find the latter offers a fuller dimension of sound because these cans are open. Besides I am a party of one and get no human static for any volume issues.    As far as the fit I have never owned a set that did not make its presence known to some degree. I rate these decent in that arena... but not out of this world.    Overall I believe these are worth a serious look see. Excuse me now while I get back to my music."
R3LLPA932RVGEP,5,"I work in a machine shop. There are plenty of interference issues in the shop, including e.d.m.s(electronic discharge machines). These machines create there own electrical field that interferes with almost everything in the shop including radios. I have yet to experience any interference with these headphones, and I can get as far as 200 ft.(61 m)away. I plug mine into my computer with the included adapter. I can listen to all the streaming stations i love, with no interruptions. My RS120's are flawless. You can't ask for more headphone for the price. GREAT DEAL!! If you want ultra high quality stuff the Sennheiser website has everything you could possibly want. [...]. Check out the MX W1's. I'll get some of these babies after I'm done with school. I really can't think of any cons when you consider the affordability. Really good sound!"
R3DV7NFTFK55X5,4,"Purchased for my dad to use in a skilled care facility - can't have cords running across floor.  It works exactly as advertised, sound quality is more than adequate for television viewing.       TV set was old and didn't have output jacks, so I installed a 1/4\\"" audio plug from Radio Shack along with a micro switch to add ability to completely silence the existing TV speaker.  This leaves the option for others in the room to hear the TV while the headphones can be adjusted as loud as needed. The headphones have such a good preamp system, it does not take much volume at all from the speaker to get good sound, even with this older TV set.      I did not experience the problem some reviewers had with getting the headphones to sit properly on the cradle for charging.  Bear in mind if purchasing for someone in a nursing home, though, that the transmitter will be sitting near or on top of the TV and the headphones will need to be returned there for charging.    There is a dial to set the volume and another to match the frequency with the base unit, and these are close enough together to allow the wrong one to be turned.  Easily resolved with a small piece of tape over the frequency dial.  This minor annoyance is why I dropped the rating to 4 stars.    Bottom line, I have no regrets selecting this product.  I would suggest it as a good option for someone in a setting where headphone cords would present a problem.  It is also an excellent option for households where one member has hearing problems.  Be prepared to modify older TV sets that do not have output jacks, however."
RP3QLL1FKXVTL,4,"my father loves his british programs.  unfortunately, they're not subtitled because he can never understand a word they say because he can't hear a certain tone in their voices.  a hearing aid is out of the question so as a result he watches tv with the volume at full max.  whenever i'm in the house i wear earplugs.  it's really not funny.  i bought these with my fingers crossed.  it was a snap to set up and i waited until sunday night to surprise him when his shows came on.  he called me up on monday to actually thank me.  his words were, \\""i understood everything they said, but most of all i was able to relax and enjoy the shows.\\""  his happiness was my happiness."
R2K5JVEJVSMK2W,2,"This headphone probably sounds the best in all wireless headphones I have tried. The only problem is, it didn't work just when I needed it to. The base intermittenly stopped transmitting (green light is off), and I have a useless piece of junk. In the last 28 days, it has happened about 3 times. I tried everything from unplugging it to retuning the frequency with no success. Then the next day, it worked all of a sudden. So, it is going back to Amazon today."
R36TJVGASNB31J,5,"I was always tired of the cord-mess while listening to music at work, so wireless was the first choice.    Got my RS120 a couple of weeks back after trying out 2 other brands. The other brands(AR and Sony) failed expectations because they succumbed to all the usual interferences in a computer environment. The AR works great at home to watch TV but not at work.    With RS120, I can even walk around to get print-outs and yet don't hear any interference at all! I have even tried going upto our coffee room, where there's some noise, but one can still keep the song going.    Only crib I have is, I wish they were circum-aural (less painful on the ears after extended use), whereas these are supra-aural. I did not research on the distinction between supra and circum before making the purchase. But, apart from that it's still a great buy for the quality!"
R1FEMSQHOO62HQ,5,"I recently bought these headphones for my dad and they were an instant success.  He told me that he can hear TV better than ever before, he said he used to misshear what sports announcers said but now he can hear it clearly. He tells me these headphones are the best gift he has ever recieved. I would recommend them for anyone who wants to listen TV at a higher volume without turning the TV louder than other people want."
R3T00CSTUKL7TH,5,"Highly recommend for those that are hard of hearing or  those that like to watch tv while others are sleeping. I can walk all over my house without any problems. Connected mine to the back of my cable box and can completely mute the tv without any effect on the headphones. When you hang them back up they automatically recharge the batteries. Fit very comfortably but dont stay in place very well if you are doing any activities like treadmill or house cleaning etc..  Sound comes across much like you are in a theater, really nice."
R1BCPBW4UKLVW4,5,"I buy lots of products but I rarely give anything 5 stars and an awsome. These are really good! The price these are offered for is just unbeatable. They sound great, are very comfortable and the batteries seem to last forever."
RWGKA8E9CHH9J,4,"I received these last week and used them 5 times. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. I was expecting muted or muffled sound but it is quite good.<br />I use these primarily for TV in bedroom especially news while wife is trying to sleep. They perform as expected and as hoped. The closed nature keeps sound from migrating.<br />The comfort aspect is the only real issue for me. They can be worn for 30 minutes or so comfortably but then they get a little heavy. The ear pads are not as soft as they should be. I f you plan on wearing for movies, I might consider something else.<br />Overall, I'm pleased with the product."
RFIXTZJ6XERET,3,"After reading all the glowing reviews, perhaps I had my hopes set a little too high.  The \\""hiss\\"" is present even at best possible reception. 'Acceptable' reception radius is somewhere around 40 feet, but works best at 20ft and under. I'm guessing the quality of wireless technology still hasn't caught up to its advertising.  Even though it will improve in the coming years, I have a feeling I'll be looking back at this headset as if it were a beta from the '80s (or a VCR from the '90s)."
R3UHENPQBU551Z,4,"These headphones are a great wireless device. Whenever you tune to the signal, you can hear everything just fine. Unless you set the volume all the way high you do not hear a hissing noise. The only downside to these headphones are sometimes they get cutoff when someone near you is using some device with the same frequency. Although that's not common, if you're looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that aren't too expensive, these are the way to go. But nothing beats a wired connection, so unless you absolutely need wireless, I would recommend wired headphones."
R9PSQF5D32LIX,3,This item replaces another same brand and model purchased about 45 days prior.  The first item started cutting out sound after in use about 30 days and you had to put it back on the charging cradle for a few minutes.  This would happen with little or no time using it.  The replacement item worked until it had been in use about 10 or 15 days and it has started cutting out occasionally.  The headphone is being used about 20 feet from the TV and it's charging cradle.  It usually cuts out after in use for about an hour or so.  Never used over 2 or 3 hours at time.
R3D9GYSCZK4FDO,4,i can finally enjoy watching tv the headphones are great only thing missing is an indicating lite on them i have a pair of sony with the lite but these are definitely better sound
R3K5OXQWRB6JO1,5,"Absolutely satisfied, especially for the price.  I can go anywhere in the house and still hear what's on TV even though my sleeping children hear only silence."
R3SPZRA4E028I5,5,"Sound Clear, Comfortable fit and Easy to listen to TV while on Treadmill.  Stores easily out of the way!"
R2UMH01KSZE5A3,5,"The Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Rf Headphones have restored peace in our home by eliminating the conflict over volume on our TV.  My husband needs the volume high to hear dialogue, which means the commercials are annoyingly loud for me.  The constant changing of the volume was a nuisance, if it was done at all.  The end result was that I went to another room to watch TV - - often the same program!  Now that we have the headphones, my husband and I can watch the TV in the same room and chat about programs as we watch.   Added benefits = 1) my husband says the headphones deliver audio better than our surround sound system, 2) I can read in the same room where my husband is watching TV and not hear it at all, 3) he thought he looked silly wearing them until I told him he looked like a man who would do something silly so we can spend our evenings together again.   I am not into electronics, but I was able to set the headphones up in less than five minutes.  My brother (who sells electronics) selected this brand for me as being the best on the market.  I'd never heard of such a product so my recommendation to the manufacturer = advertise in AARP!!!"
R3A8Q4ZNP50JJX,5,"These headphones are simply great.   I was looking for a way to watch TV without disturbing my wife while she worked nearby.  No static at all when I turned the volume up on the source.   I did notice minor hissing when the source was at lower volume but that disappeared when I turned the TV volume up.  Hint: be sure to turn the volume down before unplugging the headphone transmitter from the source!      In my home environment I have wifi and 4 computers (3 on wifi) along with cordless phones, microwave, DishTV, etc so heavy \\""radio\\"" traffic.  No interference problems.  But I also don't have any neighbors within 500 feet of my home (rural setting) either.  That may be a factor in a suburban or urban setting.    The sound for CDs, DVDs and video games (Wii) is also excellent in terms of localizing various directions so I am glad I did not spend more for the surround sound model.   Very comfortable to wear too.  Sennheiser is noted for accurate sound reproduction, and my ears were amazed, but then I may just be easy to please.    Placement of the headset into the charging cradle requires a special touch to be sure the charging is activated.  But that is but a minor inconvenience.  The manual is a little sparse on operating functions but when you look over the phones the controls are intuitive.      Two things of note:    1)  Be sure to push the AC adapter plug FULLY into the charging base.  I pushed until I literally heard it SNAP into place.  Until I did so I thought my charger set was defective.    2)  Be sure to fully charge the phones BEFORE first use.      I'd certainly buy another pair if I need one in the future.    So far, very satisfied and at a great price too!"
R2EGB04U8E6LMO,4,I ordered these headphones because my fiancee just started graduate school.  She'll be doing all of her reading and studying alongside me in our 1 bedroom apartment.  While I'd like to give her all the space she needs our main TV is also where she wants to study and use her laptop.  I figured I could still watch TV and listen to music with a wireless headphone setup while being around her.    I've only used the unit for 2 days so far but these wireless headphones really seem to perform as expected.  Sitting on the couch I'm only 7-8 feet from the transmitter.  Walking around the apartment I am further and separated by several walls.  So far I haven't had any issues with interference.  The transmitter will automatically power-off after not receiving an audio signal for a few minutes.  The sound is clear and dynamic.  Stereo effects in movies are obvious.  Even though the headphones don't have surround sound you get the feeling of presence and spacial relations in the audio.    The foam on the earpieces is a little bit itchy but that may be limited to my experience.  I've never really been happy with over-the-ear headphones.  It's not a major issue.    I can't report on battery performance just yet but I expect it to be ok.    Overall in 2 days I'm very happy with my purchase.  The price is absolutely right.
R2AUMJJDMFWFST,3,Just recieved and tested my headphones and was presently surprised.  They do fit loose so inless you don't plan on moving around while using them they will be fine.  The sound quality is excellent and the surround sound effects are great for movies.  Despite using headphones other around you will be able to hear the movie/music while using these at any reasonable volume.  The sound is clear of hissing for the most part but you still get the occasional breakthough of static.  As with all wireless headphones this can not be avoided.  It is somewhat annoying but for this price range these are the best headphones you can get.
R181F2CMZE3T4T,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser Rs[...] 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle]]I bought this for my 80 year old father in law!  He's thrilled and so is Mom!  If you're hard of hearing and need some help with the TV or Stereo, these do a nice job!  If your hearing is great and you're looking for great sound...stay with a corded headphone.  Wireless headphones can't avoid some noise/signal degradation with today's technology.  I also got a RS [...] at the same time for my girlfriend, who is harder of hearing then her father.  I compared the two...and I could not say there was any difference in sound quality...but then my ears are not the best in the world either.  Maybe if your hearing is pretty good to begin with you would notice a significant difference.  With moderate hearing loss, there is not point in spending more on the RS [...]."
R2TIK35R1MQJMI,1,"I bought this headphone mainly for computer use, but it turns out they are terrible for that purpose.  For some reason, after a couple of minutes without sound the base unit shuts off and that causes the headphones to blast you with extremely loud static.  While browsing the internet, if I go to a site like YouTube I turn them on but if I forget to turn them off in a couple of minutes I get a harsh blast.  It's gotten to the point where I am afraid of using these.  Also, when they are working I get hissing and popping even when I'm just a couple of feet from the base station.    Do not get these for computer use!"
RCO0SCBY7K9IU,4,"The R120 is a good choice for listening to music or TV without disturbing others. The sound is fine, in fact good. The interference, noise or hiss mentioned in other reveiws is not really noticable and very much within satisfactory limits. I agree that putting the Volume and Signal controls next to each other is just dumb, and they are a bit bigger that last last pair of Senheisers I owned, but that is the only real knocks on the product. I chose not to spend more on the higher end models and belive that I made the right choice. For the money these work very well."
R2ZQJUNMR7373A,5,"I love these headphones! I use them so often, while cleaning house and going from room to room, in the basement, to the garage, getting the mail, and even working out in the yard while listening to the TV or Stereo that is in the house. They are very comfortable. I sometimes forget I have them on. Excellent quality, very well made.  There are a few places in my home where I have static , but this always happens at the same places so I think there is an interference, but not because of the head phones.  It took a little time to figure out how to work them but not much. Just read the directions carefully. I did not understand how just setting them on the charger would to the trick. Look at the picture closely and you will see it is just a matter of setting the metal parts of the phones on the metal of the cradle.  I highly recommend this product."
R3HKNZL4R4I6CR,4,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle]]    I found this headphone much better than previous models by Sony I had before. The recharging time is quick and sound very good. The quality is worth its price.
R36COR0GJ2BEI0,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle]]   got these in the mail and pluged them in.  the sound was incredable,  ive tried sony, colby, radio shack,  I just curious how the more expensive models sound.   these are comfortable,  i love the volume control,  plus the frequency control. diffently worth the money"
R151B5TBW805E9,5,"My husband uses these headphones every night after he gets home from work so he doesn't wake up me or the kids. He loves them and so do I. No complaints, excellent quality and price. I was surprised to purchased something other than Sony, but I'm glad I did my research."
R1U8CGVWWVL3BV,2,"I have a small house and the layout makes it hard to watch tv late at night without disturbing my toddler and husband. After suffering many sleepless nights where I would have to strain to hear the tv, sometimes not being able to hear it at all when the heater was on, I bought headphones. I decieded on these because of the design and price. The work ok but will spontaenously turn off creating a VERY loud static sound. This is not very nice to hear when you are falling asleep. Sometimes it would take three or four times resetting them before I'd get an hour or two of uninterrupted time. Not worth the price due to the performance."
R3689KE9QGKUI5,5,"Excellent product, easy to set up.  Good range for the wireless.  Heavan when the kids are watching the t.v. and you want a bit of peace and quiet..."
RDXP6NR0XCBSK,5,"I have a hearing problem.  This set of headphones sits on its  cradle charging until I pick them up to use them.  I set the   volume for my preference.  The headset does not effect my hearing  aids (no squealing); and my wife can set the tv for whatever volume  level she prefers.   She loves them, until she wants to get my attention,  that is.  We have come to the following resolution:  Commercial time, I  pull the phone off my ear, until the program is back on (Mute does not  work on the phones).  That is the time for us to talk.  When the   commercials are over, slide the phone back on my ear, and back to the  program sound track.  Love em.    Cons:  They do get warm on your ears."
R1OHKZWK6ZZ2A4,5,"This is the second pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones that I own. My hearing at age 68 is not what it used to be. I have lost 40% of my hearing according to my doctor and these really help when I listen to the tv.If you are \\""hard of hearing\\"", these headphones are the answer to your problem."
R1F5E1WW39M6LV,1,"I bought this headphone without checking the actual size of the headphones. So, when I recieved it from Amazon, it was too big and heavy for me. I also couldn't get a clear sound from the reception."
R18Y5AFXD3PD2F,5,"Got the headphones today and they are awesome. They are crystal clear throughout the whole house. The base I have in an upstairs bedroom and I can go into the basement, 3 floors down, and they are as clear in the basement as they are next to the base. Nice sound. Easy to use."
RG08ZMUAWKC7E,5,"This is a top of the line set of wireless headphones. Once you tune it correctly the sound is great. I am not getting any \\""dead\\"" noise as long as there is a signal."
R1ZJ7G56BSFJNJ,3,"These are ok headphones.  Great sound.  I did have a pair of RS 110 but the headset went bad.  They want to fall off your head if you bend your head over just a little, not the best if you are walking around.  I hope these last longer than the RS 110 set."
R10MCXNBOTQ985,5,I bought these Headphones for my Dad for Christmas and he has just raved about them ever since.  No interference and very comfortable.  I tried other headphones like Sony and Phillips and the price was over $100.00 plus they were so uncomfortable.  The Sennheiser headphones are nice and soft on the ears and are easy to re-charge.  I would definitely recommend these headphones.
R11AC5MANGECAG,5,"I got these for my wife for Christmas, and she is very happy with them.  They are more comfortable than the older brand she used to wear, and reception is good on the second floor even with the transmitter along an outside wall in the basement.  The recharging stand is innovative and extremely convenient."
R1Z03KZ0342OMT,4,"This item works fairly well if you are watching television or want to listen to music by yourself... but if you want to listen in and others listen too, they are useless. You also have to be careful to make sure that the charging unit is in contact with the headset in the right position to keep the unit charged.  If correct contact is not maintained, the unit does not charge."
R1PHLKRIWL5H3Y,2,"My entire reason for purchasing the Sennheiser RS120 headphones was to be able to watch and listen to TV while my wife was in the same room and did not want to hear TV sound.  After connecting these headphones, I found that sound continues to come from the TV AS WELL AS through the headphones.  Customer Service from Sennheiser (after several futile tries to get a rep on the phone) told me that the headphones are not designed to cut off the sound from the TV; I wondered why anyone would want BOTH TV sound and headphone sound at the same time...to me, this makes no sense.  So, for those of you who may be looking for wireless headphones to use while watching TV while your spouse/partner is in the same room/area and is trying to read or sleep, these are NOT for you. My 2 star rating is because the sound quality is quite good and the unit is comfortable."
R24B86GNQUCG1Z,4,So far I'm really impressed with these headphones. I used them  to listen to the digital radio while I worked around the house today and I got great reception in most every room. The one I did have a problem in was just slightly fuzzy and it was the furthest room in the house and we have a pretty large house. I do wish they weren't quite so bulky but it seems to that way with all of them from what I can tell.
R31HOFM957EQVO,2,"I bought this product thinking that I could put the TV in \\""mute\\"" and continue to enjoy the programs.  However, it doesn't work in mute mode and often cuts off even when the volume is 1/3 of full volume.  At this sound level, I don't need a wireless headphone, so making this product practically useless for the purpose I bought it for.   Sounds great though if working properly."
R1GBIGWVFR3YB8,5,We couldn't believe the sound quality coming out of these headphones. My husband uses them when he's on the treadmill and doesn't have to wake the neighbors turning the TV up loud enough to hear it over the sound the treadmill makes.  Now we want a set for the family room!
R2WMJOBOY66W0G,5,"but they work great. i am very hard of hearing, profound hearing loss and i can hear every word and every note of the background music. i recommend it, try it and you love it"
R1I74MZCMUAZX1,5,Love them.  I live in a nursing home and wear them all night to watch TV and block out outside noises.  Good quality and very very comfortable.  Stongly recommend.
RE9XUWCQOGQTF,5,"I really like these headphones ,I bought them to watch TV while my wife reads.Make sure you have a headphone jack with the unit you plan to use them with.My new TV had no jack and I ended up plugging the Sennheiser into my satellite box.My tv has a built in DVD player so I can't listen to DVD movies but I can listen to all the satellite stations.  I really have no complants about the Sennheiser product that I bought,I think the sound quality is very good."
RRK3J4F2J32A0,4,"Bought this item for my wife. Good sound, no interference or hissing.  Easy to hook up and I was able to place it right on top of the TV.  My wife is not to keen on the way they fit on her ears.  They don't fit around her ears but, on hers ears. She had tried a pair on at Radio Shack  and liked the fit better.    Overall a quality product and a great price."
R3DEJRJRW1GJEE,2,"Didn't work on our hd tv - had to have the volume cranked way up - so purpose in purchase was defeated.  May just be our TV - worked 'ok' with our older model - but we still had to have the volume up on the set and we purchased what we thought was wireless headphones that would cut the tv sound from the tv and channel the sound into the headphones.  It didn't and apparently doesn't work that way.  We sent them back December 28th, using Amazon's convenient site-generated mailing label.  We are still waiting for acknowledgement that the package was recieved. Have been told we must wait till Jan 30 to recontact them about it. First time we've ever had to return anything. I'm getting ansy!"
R136GUAN1RY7SS,5,"This wireless headphone set costs only $25 more than the Sony MDR-IF240RK at the time I'm writing this, and is *MANY TIMES* better.  Music actually sounds OK!  The effective range is at least 50 feet or more; I can walk to the other side of the office building and only gain a few pops.    The sound quality is about what you'd expect of FM radio, like in your car.  It's not perfect.  There's a touch of hiss, especially when these headphones auto-raise the sound level of \\""quiet\\"" passages (which they do; occasionally annoying).  But overall, these headphones are very pleasant-sounding and comfortable.  Considering the low-ish price and the inferiority of the competition, I am delighted.  (I had tried the Sony first as a cheap alternative, and they were awful.)"
R1EF7JVCDR34FQ,5,"I bought these headphone for my 95 year old dad who played the TV so loudly that even though he maintains that he is not deaf, he was making everyone else in the house deaf.  We couldn't hold a conversation in the kitchen because the TV in the living room was so loud.  Now we are living in blessed quiet where everyone can speak in a normal voice and my dad is thrilled to pieces because he can hear the TV clearly again.  He finds the headphones very easy to use even though I read in a review that the switches were too close to each other and hard to differentiate.  He says they are small and hard to see but not that hard to use.  He is so happy!  He can hear every word that is said by everyone on the television and if he wants to get up and walk around, he continues to wear the headphones and doesn't miss a moment of his programs.  This is important when someone moves as slowly as he does and just getting a drink from the kitchen can be a 5 minute trip.  He finds the headphones to be light on his head and easy to wear and they do not interfere with his hearing aid.      The only problem we did experience was that we had cordless telephones in the room and they picked up the sound from the TV after the cordless headphones were installed.  Our solution was to get rid of the cordless phones and go back to a wired table model.  I think that there are additional channels that you can select on the telephones so that the interference disappears.  We tried several channels but the problem continued so we just gave up.    My dad is so thrilled with these headphones that he recommended them to his 97 year old sister and her 98 year old gentleman friend who have similar hearing problems.    By the way, my 25 year old daughter has also used the headphones to watch TV and agrees that they are great."
RBHU3E63ZWKVM,5,"I purchased this product so that I could watch television in the early morning hours without creating alot of noise for family, also, to wear while on my treadmill as my wife complained that I had the TV sound too high when I was working out.  This headphone is perfect.  I think others were trying to use it like stero headphone and therefore complain about the sound but I think it is just great.  No static or interference.  Also, these are light weight and they do not squeeze your head or ears so you can where them for for prolonged periods."
R3O81D2KH047GT,5,"[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle]]  I have used the phones with great results.  I walk from room to room and even out to our lanai and get great reception and sound no matter where I go.  I enjoy the phones very much and would recommend them to anyone.  I previously owned a set of wireless phones from Brookstone and even though I enjoyed them, these are even better."
R2EUU2HOMTWHVH,5,"I have hearing problems and need something to help me hear DVD's, CD's, and ect.  Even at church these are plugged into the sound system and the people with hearing problems can wear them and hear everything that goes through the speakers.  They are very comfortable.    The volume and ect is kind of difficult to learn to adjust because they are on the back part of the ear speaker.  But it is not bad."
R27WK735U98SY8,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, whose 18 month old sleeps with her and her husband.  She loves this item.  It allows for watching tv without disturbing anyone else who happens to be sleeping."
R3EEIL1W4IWWJJ,4,The instructions for the set up of the system were really difficult to follow.  Finally figured it out I think.
R1HXTAGXVDYSLK,4,"I am very happy with these headphones. The range extends throughout my house, they're easy to set up and use and they have great sound quality. They sit conveniently on the charger, which looks good as a display stand. Also, the headphones are very comfortable to wear.    The only downside is that you have to search for the correct channel and deal with static until you find it. This happens about half the time when you turn them on but once you find the channel, they're good to go until you turn them off again. This is the first pair of wireless headphones I've ever owned so maybe this is an issue with all of them. I just didn't know about it.    But I'm still very happy with these!"
R800KSJTKXZFT,5,Bought this as a gift and they loved it.  Had tried other brands and were not satisfied.  These were exteremely comfortable and had great sound.  The signal could be recieve from a good distance and with a lot of movement.
R1Z8F38MNPHKH1,5,[[ASIN:B0001FTVEK Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle]]I have had these phones for a month now and never was more satisfied with any product.  I use these mostly for watching TV.  So often TV dramas have annoying music in the background while two people are whispering to each other--so I miss most of the conversations.  But with these headphones the stereo music is about a foot on either side while the conversation is right in my ear!  I hear every word.  In addition I hook the  transmitter to my MP3 player and can walk all around my house and listen to high quality music--with NO static!!  The charging cradle is a convenient place to store the phones and I never worry about charging the batteries.  Great product!!!
R18B2WC93OY1N6,5,"After doing a bit of research and pricing, I ordered these Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headphones for these reasons: I have used Sennheiser in the past and like the quality, this set is only $69.99 and includes charging cradle so I won't have to mess with switching batteries.  They are very easy to operate, my channel and tune was correct right out of the box, so they worked immediately after charging. The range is excellent, my base is somewhat centralized but I can walk anywhere in my 1600 sq. ft. home as well as the front or backyard with no interruptions.<br /><br />I have no complaints, they are perfect for what I need them for, but my boyfriend says the bass isn't very good, so if that's a big requirement for you - you may want something else. For wireless including charger, you can't beat the price for the quality.  Great Value!<br /><br />There is a small bit of \\""static\\"" if you're using a high volume on the headphones themselves.  However, if you keep the headphone volume lower and turn it up on your TV, PC (or whatever you're using) it will sound much better.<br /><br />For people saying they didn't work, try this: put the batteries in the headphones, plug the charging cradle into the wall, make sure \\""charge\\"" lights up when you place the headphones on the cradle (metal to metal), leave them there for at least 18 hours before using.  If they still do not work, try changing the channel at the bottom front of the charging cradle and slowly tune them on the headphones until music is clear.  Also make sure they volume is actually turned up."
RM6CLSSAF4GJ2,3,"My only complaint is that these headphones do not hold to the head. If one looks down, they fall to the floor. Had I known this before buying it, I would have looked for a better fitting model and brand."
RU822RF868UJX,5,I bought two of these for my wife and I so we can watch TV and not disturb our kids...or visversa.  Hookup was very easy with powerhooked up for both stands to charge each headset...and one stand hooked to output from our home audio which transmits to both headsets.  Sound is mostly clear even when going to other rooms in the house.  Headsets are comfortable to wear as well.  I bought a single headset last year...Acoustic Research or something like that...that did not work nearly as well as these...I highly recommend these...especially in light of their reasonable price.
R1FK7VY8GS85IN,4,"The headphones have screeching and static when the base is placed near the tv.  The directions specifically state not to place base unit near tv; I moved the charging cradle to a nearby desk and the headphones work great.  I use them primarily to watch tv and play games at night so as not to wake up the family.  The sound quality is wonderful, especially the deep bass."
R2MCI5SQLW24M7,1,"I was unable to get these headphone to give me a clear signal of any kind. You had to hold you head perfectly still to get bad mono reception, as soon as you moved your head you would get blasted with squelch. I tried every channel combination, tuned it every way I could. This set is basically worthless, and I have to return another gift that doesnt work. I can only assume I have a bad transmitter but they need to QA this stuff."
RXIKEZAA5HM9M,5,"Headphones work well.  Sound is great.  Easy setup right out of the box.  A minor annoyance is the auto shut-off feature since they are used primarily for transcription work.  Once you get used to it, is easy to work around."
R933HL6DFGP7K,5,"Pros:  -SOOO nice not having to deal with wires.  -They sound great.  -Very comfortable; I wear them for hours and forget they are on.  -The battery has never died.  I think the longest I've used them continuously is about eight hours.  -Haven't tested the range; my apartment is dorm room with concrete walls about 40'x40' and no problems with reception, ever.  Cons:  -All the cons are pretty minor compared to the pros  -If there is no signal, ie. the last song ends, the headset cuts to static after about one minute.  This can be annoying, especially if you forget it's on high volume or if your trying to queue a song and it cuts to a hiss.  But it reminds you not to waste the battery so, not entirely a con.  -If I bend my head forward or backwards, they tend to slip off my ears.  Doesn't happen a lot, not really a big deal.  -Occasionally picks up stray radio signals from other devices.  It's barely noticeable, and not unexpected given that there are hundreds of other students using all sorts of radio devices around me.    Great product.  I would buy another one."
R1L4BBGA5PVSFK,5,They are comfortable and easy to use. The sound is very clear (TV) and no painful crackles or interference noise. Highly recommended!
R1424E6X4L2FK3,4,"Very good sound, not so much from a TV source, as described by other reviewers.  Meaning, slightly hissy during low sound transmissions.<br /><br />Ear muffs are large, they probably could have been designed a bit smaller but are comfortable.<br /><br />Works great for me, just what I wanted.<br /><br />PS: Bought these for my wife, so when she watches TV and I have to do work, I can stay in the same comfortable room and neither of us are disturbed.<br /><br />Sennheiser (German) is a great and recommended brand.<br /><br />N-Joy!"
R3VM2HNX13QNKT,1,I recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser Rs 120 wireless headphones that I used while watching TV (I have a hearing problem).  I was replacing a pair of Sennheiser TR 140 because the headset arm cracked in the middle between the two ear pads.  The Rs 120 are ok headphones just to give you the audio but the clarity and quality of the sound pales in comparison to the TR 140.  I would not recommend you purchase these headphones (cost around $80.00) just to get the audio.  You can get the same result from a cheaper set.  The Rs120 was a great headphone but unfortunately the head piece is too brittle and is prone to crack.
R3165X8TKA8AS6,5,"Finally!  I don't have to listen to my wife's reality shows while trying to read and go to sleep!!!!  Headphones work great.  Recommend them to anybody who has a spouse/partner who watches pointless TV shows on a TV in the bedroom.  The headphones remove a thorn in a very good relationship.  Clear reception, comfortable, no problems."
R13SECR1GC57CU,5,"These are great wireless headphones.  First they are Sennheiser, their headphones are industry standard in the broadcast world the sound is great.  I agree with all the reviews that talk about the hiss when there is no signal, but it is wireless and there is going to be noise no matter what, radio technology is inherently noisy no matter what, this noise is most pronounced when there is no input signal.  All the arguments about the splitter verses RCA jacks is non-sense, just plug the RCA jacks into a tape out or line output jack on your amp and you are set.    The charging system is perfect, just hang the phones on the base station and they are charging!  Excellent design.  You will enjoy these headphones."
R1B7SZGT0MPCPV,5,"I've been in the market trying to buy a decent pair of wireless headphones for a while, and when I found these I instantly thought: wow, Sennheisers for under 100?! I just had to jump on them. I just received them 2 days ago and I'm not disappointed. The charging system is very clever and the headphones not only serve its purpose but are also a nice stylish accessory for my computer desk. Aesthetics are definitely a plus. Sound quality is great, static is noticeable only when completely silent and with proper tuning it can be minimal. All in all, I believe these are definitely a good deal and if you're looking to get a pair of wireless headsets under any kind of budget at all these are it. Good luck shopping!"
R3RKXRJOG50NXR,5,"I purchased these for my daughter- She has them hooked up to her laptop and is able to walk all around the house listening to her itunes.  The sound is crystal clear- no static.  I did my research prior to purchasing these, but you never know how they will actually perform- They truly exceeded our expectations.  Awesome product.  I highly recommend them."
R23X5ZES8H3Q12,5,I bought this for my husband so he could hear tv when I'm asleep and it really works. He said it's like having surround sound and he can hear everything even when they whisper. He can even get up and leave the room and listen with no problems. I highly recommend this brand and I'm sorry I didn't know about it sooner.
R1CEBYRA0RD68E,3,Has a hissing sound in the backround. Not terrible but far from great. Like a radio in a parking lot.
R3361CVUUN0609,5,"I was saving up my Coke rewards for this product but was not prepared to wait 2.5 years so my wife bought me them for Christmas, after I had read all the reviews good and bad. Happily I am delighted with the gift. Tuning rarely requires a tweek and the sound is clear and well balanced. I love being able to sit outside and listen whilst enjoying the garden. I also learned that I won't miss phone calls....the scream that interrupts the music is an effective ring tone. I can put up with that as our phone does not ring too often. Overall, a very pleasing purchase."
R36ELU2DFK2BZU,5,I am using them with my computer and my iTunes.  They are very comfortable and sound great.  They are powerful enough to reach most of the house.  I like them better than my older pair of Sonys.
R3FUNLO5558RX9,3,"I got these headphones for Christmas just a few days ago.  Thankfully the set up is easy becuase the manual is not at all helpful.  They are surprisingly light considering you have 2 batteries in your right ear.  They sound decent, but I was definately expecting better after seeing some of the reviews and considering the \\""original\\"" price.      My biggest beef with these headphones is that they are totally uncomfortable.  I can't see wearing these for longer than 20 minutes.  They do not form to your ears at all.  The ear cups are completely flat and hard.    As with other reviewers I notice a hissing sound in the background even when they are completely tuned.  I also found out that if anyone in the room is using a cell phone (and probably any other wireless device) the interference created is enough to block the usage of the headphones.  You'll know by the horrible loud noise filling your ears.  Not pleasent!    Overall, if you are looking for a quality headphone, these are NOT it.  But for the price, they are not bad."
R339WW4MHSSLWA,5,"Excellent quality, as loud as you want, comfortable, stylish, and I can walk the dog and not loose the signal. I am getting one for all my freinds and family. AND GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
R7NUF4SE0A38S,4,no frills but works very well in a moderately sized room.  Sound is good and very convenient to charge (the stand doubles as the charger).  Can't beat it in terms of price / performance.  I don't see a reason anyone would need to go to the next model up.
R3UKJ7I1RDSHN3,4,"I asked for these as a Christmas Gift and little did I know what a favor I was doing for myself. On Christmas morning I took them out of the box, very simply connected the two wires into the back of the Television and plugged the charger into the wall. I thought I'd figure it all out when we got home from the Family Dinner.   That evening I put on the headset wondering how difficult it was going to be to set it all up and was amazed to find that it was already working. I had anticipated a complicated kind of nightmare involving the menu on the television (of which the original remote has long since disappeared..) but no, this was a hundred times easier than I expected. There was no set up procedure. Just put it on and go. So, once I got over that pleasant surprise, I discovered the fantastic sound quality. I even listened to the absolute rubbish they were playing on MTV just to check out the surround sound feel of it all. Amazing. I've watched a couple of movies that I've seen before and I was surprised to hear all kinds of extra comments and sounds that I didn't hear the first time around. I'm definitely buying a set of these for my Father-in-law as he wears a hearing aid and would really appreciate the many benefits they would have to offer him. If I had to fault them, then there are only two small aspects, and they might be peculiar to me, I don't know. I find if I bend over while wearing them, they will slip off my head. The other thing is that, after wearing them for about five or six hours, my left ear begins to ache a little. I think that both of these problems are due to the fact that you cannot adjust the width of the headset, only the height. But they're still great. I just hold onto them when I'm brushing my teeth and make sure to adjust them forward a bit if I feel my ear begin to ache. Finally, another great thing is how easy it is to recharge them. When I'm finished for the evening, I just sit them back on the cradle, and that wire touches off a pair of exposed metal strips in the headband part and hey presto, the charging light comes straight on, no messing about. I love this product and think all televisions should automatically come with at least one pair."
R2BWV0OB7WRWEX,4,"product was delivered quickly and in great condition. It contained no instructions, however, so i was a little annoyed about that. But with some simple online searching i figured out how to set it up and discovered that it was quite simple - just plug it in and turn it on!   So far the product works great and I am very happy with it!! I can watch TV at night in bed next to my husband and he doesn't hear a thing! I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
R1Y7ZDQPR8RZ40,5,"Bought this for my father-in-law, but tested it on my TV first. The sound quality is excellent, it is very comfortable (although I didn't wear it for any extensive period), and it is easy to recharge. I testd plugging it into the earphone jack and the RCA jacks on the rear of the set. RCA jacks work best!  Reception is great and was incredibly far reaching. It worked well with father-in-law's hearing aids too. Two minor disappointments: 1) the unit must be setup near the TV - even though the cord was long, it wasn't long enough to reach a bedside table, so if wearing at night and you are ready to sleep, you'll need to get up to put on the cradle or wait until AM to charge it. 2) tuning was easy, but dial too close to the volume adjustment. I put tape on the tuning \\""wheel\\"" so my elderly father-in-law wouldn't mistakenly move it instead of the volume dial."
R1LA3RRX7IWCLQ,4,"I got this for my dad as a Christmas gift & he really likes it.<br />He can now listen to the TV as loud as he needs.<br />The headset is comfortable. Installation was not a problem per my husband.<br />The only issue I have is that these are made in China.<br />If this is stated by Amazon, I missed it. If not I would love to know where products I purchase are made ahead of ordering."
R3Q83SYD5Y00F3,5,I've had one set for a few years and they certainly worked fine for me.  I needed a second set for another TV and didn't need to look at any other model.  Good sound.  Easy to hook up.  Good range.  Good price.
R33S1LYSG1AK9T,4,"These wireless headphones are just what i wanted for watching football while my wife reads in the same room.  There is some static in the headphones when not recieving audio, but not at all noticible otherwise. Have not tried them for listing to music.  Very easy to set up and  use."
R1EXP6BATYH84Z,4,"It works very well, its comfortable, you can adjust it so as not to have interference, etc.    But, if you use it in bed, as I do, be sure that your partner will listen unless you use it in very low volume.   Perhaps I have to have a bigger bed..."
R1Y4CJMIPG2XLX,5,"Just bought these for a Christmas gift for myself. They sound great,no problem with static. I would highly recommend these headphones I had no problem setting them up."
R2FM7DJEUQX6M2,5,"Fantastic! Just tried these out and they have impressive sound quality with no interference, static or distortion.  Handsome, well designed combination of charging stand and headset.  Headsets are comfortable with easy to use controls and the tuner locks right on to the signal without having to fiddle around with it.  Only suggestion might be to have a green fully charged light on the charging stand.  The charging indicator light always shows red even when the headsets are fully charged."
R1M4L3SYW9MLZB,4,"I liked:<br />This model is very comfortable and lightweight. Great sound quality (it sounded as nice as corded headphones) and it has a volume control built into the unit. The transmitter has a nice range and also charges the headphone battery.<br />Unit automatically shut off after a few minutes if no audio is going through them, but it also has an On/Off switch, some might prefer to turn it off manually.<br />Low priced compared to other less featured headphones.<br /><br />Didn't Like:<br />Sometimes there was noise and hiss mixed with the sound, what could have been interference. In this case switch to another channel.<br />The tune and volume controls are too close to each other.<br />The bass wasn't as powerful as I would have liked.<br />In the included manual, they listed a 3.5mm / ¼\\"" adapter, which I could not find."
R36THE4Z3X3797,5,"I searched everywhere to find the best headphones for my dad. My dad is hard of hearing and without headphones we were all listening to his programs...lol.. The old ones he had no longer worked, and the brand was no longer available to purchase.  After reading several reviews, I decided to take a chance with the Sennheiser since the positive reviews completely outweighed the negative reviews. My dad absolutely LOVES them! He says that they are clear, no ringing or hissing like other reviews stated, and the best of all, he is able to go into the kitchen, garage, back porch, and even went across the street to get the mail, while listening to his programs.  The only downside is that he has them on all the time now...It feels really good to see that he enjoys them so much, and likes the fact that they are rechargable, which the last pair wasn't. I did try them myself, and unfortunately, they were very loud because my dad was using them, but the sound was really good.  There was a little bit of static in them, but that was due to the volume they were on. I would purchase another pair in a heartbeat, and would recommend them to everyone."
R21L1WO6BG3D6U,4,"EDIT: 2012: This become unusable at work when I got stuck in a 4-up cube. Just too much interference.<br /><br />I brought this home and gave it to my son - who insists on having his study desk next to the home theater. I can't blame him per-se - but he's been on the edge of eviction to his own room due to two-way noise conflicts.<br /><br />He hooked these up put them on and wouldn't let me touch them. He gets good noise isolation (almost too much - doesn't hear the intercom) and it's got the quietness and good range as advertised.<br /><br />So I recommend these - just with the caveat that they may not work well in a work cube type environment.<br /><br />Original follows:<br />This is for RS120 and RS130 - and I eventually bought the RS130.<br /><br />I work for a computer company and bought this for my cube. A key characteristic is lots of RF noise - nearly every adjacent cube has a laptop and a deskside (or two if doubled up).<br /><br />Essentially all reviews were for home use. I was fortunate to borrow an RS-120 and an RS-130 at work - same floor even) I used the RS-120 for half hour and the RS-130 all day.<br /><br />From overall performance, I found RS-120 and RS-130 comparable as far as susceptibility to interference. I preferred the around the ear of the RS-130 over the RS-120 and my colleage with the RS-120 indicated his ears need a break from the RS-120 after several hours.<br /><br />The surround sound and auto tuning of the RS-130 were plusses but I bought the RS-130 mostly for the around the ear comfort and fit.<br /><br />Overall I really like these - but I do have some comments - and those tie back to other comments - \\""the hiss in the background\\"".<br /><br />Some posters commented on \\""the hiss in the background\\"". My RS-130s (and the one I borrowed) had this - but as Bruce Campbell said \\""it's a trick - get an axe\\"".<br /><br />OK, they're not tricking you - but there is a workaround.<br /><br />The hiss seems to come from their on-headphone amplifier. You can make that go away by<br /><br />1) setting the on-headphone volume very low. Essentially dial it down until the hiss just goes away. Or a little more if you want to adjust volume more from headphone than computer.<br /><br />2) Crank up the drive to the base unit. I've got my computer Wave and Volume controls set very much higher than I used with my corded headphones. And now I get great volume out of the headphones. And I get it without any perceptible clipping or degradation.<br /><br />The bottom line - the base unit likes and is fine with driving it relatively hard - and by doing that not using much of the headset amp you sill not have a hiss problem.<br /><br />My last point is interference. In this very noise (ambient RF) environment at work I occasionally have a \\""pfft\\"" as I turn my head or move about. Occasionally. Even with base 3 feet away. But so far, I've found no headset better and these are otherwise really sweet. [I otherwise can't say how these do with 900mhz phones]<br /><br />Overall - 4 stars and in particular prime for office use."
RLB2JP2Y99P9T,4,"I did a lot of research online to get some wireless headphones.  I was looking for a pair mainly to play Guitar Hero III at night while the wife was asleep.  I just got the RS120's last night and charged them up.  Today I tried them out and am still trying to adjust them to get the optimal signal.  At times, they are clear and without interference.  Othertimes, I cannot to tune properly.  I'll have to play around with my setup and move the base away from my TV and router etc.    Overall, the headphones are very comfortable (on-ear design), lightweight, and the base unit/charger is a very elegant with a sleek design.  However, I would have preferred an all black base to match my all black plasma and other AV gear.    4 stars since I am having interference problems...not bad for the price ($57)."
R1T97MJXFUE43F,2,"I had high expectations for this product given the Sennheiser brand. The charging cradle is very usable and the headphones are a comfortable fit. The device offers 3 transmission frequencies to choose from (which are public by the way). In the office we had issues of two people with similar headphones trying to use the same channel. But the main problem I have had is sound quality and interference with other devices. In the office we have the typical array of other electronic devices. Same thing in my apartment. In both locations the headphones produce a \\""wine\\"" or \\""hiss\\"" noise when the head is oriented at a certain angle relative to the base station. I had this happen at both locations. It is annoying enough that enjoyment of music is consistently degraded. I mailed Sennheiser about the problem and received no response. I have purchased a pair of A2DP bluetooth headphones which are much better sound quality, with no hiss - too bad they don't have as nice of a recharging station. If you have any other electronics in your listening environment I don't recommend purchasing the sennheisers."
R7O1JHX8JP04B,5,"I was sceptical about getting RF wireless headphones.  I just knew that one of my many gadgets in my home would interfere with the headphones.  I WAS WRONG!!!! These headphones work great! The sound is awesome and I don't have to worry about them cutting out when somone walks between me and the TV.  These are a perfect solution to a wife that loves to start a conversation in the middle of watching \\""House\\"" or when the kids decide to start bickering about whats on TV.  I simply place my new headphones over my ears, flip on the switch and the problems magically go away.  I do get looks of annoyance because I am lying in my recliner with a silly grin on my face."
R1FCJ1Q09UAJX0,5,"I bought these headphones based on reading other people's reviews of them. I was not disappointed.  I find them to be comfortable, and they have great sound quality. They were simple to set up and the charger works perfectly.  My one complaint concerns using them while I am on the treadmill working out.  There are big pieces of foam on each earpiece and on the head band.  When I get sweaty, the foam pieces get sweaty and gross.  Not great for the next person when it's their turn to work out.  That isn't a design flaw, but I do wish that there was an easy solution to that problem."
R375255C38XAYU,1,"These headphones are terrible if you want clean sound. On the other hand, they are fantastic if you like hiss and distortion. It's almost like torture to use them. The hiss and static are so bad, and require so much fiddling, that you can't even concentrate on what you're listening to.<br /><br />I'll be returning these..."
R2Y8UHXCVDZHBV,5,These headphones are great.  Strong reception and absolutely clear sound.   Could not have asked for more at any price.
R12KL8AZH5821B,1,"Totally inadequate instructions. Bought them for my TV and am unable to use them. No matter where I plug them in, I get no sound. If they do not work on older TVs, it should be stated in the advertising."
R35EF1WOPM6Y0Q,1,"I just received my pair of Sennheiser Wireless Headphones RS-120 and after about an hour (after letting them charge for 24 hours per the instructions) of moving the base, switching channels, fine tuning, I just simply gave up. I could never get clear reception without static. I am very disappointed in these headphones... I just ordered and received, about three weeks ago, another set of Sennheiser headphones and was very pleased, so I was very excited about the wireless ones... until now. Not sure if it is my location or what, but I do not recommend these headphones."
R23TNZAFO56S4T,5,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tried my sennheiser rs120 wireless headphones! The sound was crisp and clear as corded phones. The range from the base is also great,as they still work 200' from my house, and that is with the base in my basement! The charging cradle is a no brainer- just replace phones and walk away. The only problem I found is phones tend to slide off my head during workouts,but the great sound makes up for this slight annoyance."
R1FQG2BQ61VBRR,4,Very comfortable and easy to put in charging cradle.  Magnetized beams make it stay put on the cradle.
R167SPOKVGXTK,5,"I am very pleased with this product. The sound is good, the set up easy and the price is right. The volume   dial could be larger and placed at a better spot but that's minor. Delivery was in 5 days. The range is good.  I have gone about 50 ft. from the transmitter and still had perfect sound. Good buy."
R1QF267A4R6SGX,4,"The headphones work great, the only thing I don't like is the way the headphones fit my head.  The German engineer who designed the headphones must have used his own head, the fit doesn't work for this good ole boy. I think I have a normal head but the phones are shaped for large heads and the ears must be strangely differant from mine."
R1C4VA8QL0DPRT,5,"This is a great product and works as advertised.  You can turn your tv volume off (not mute) and adjust the volume on the headphones accordingly. I have a dvr but with these headphones I actually enjoy some of the commercials (very few) because of the great audio (different than tv speakers). Perfect for when my wife wants to read and I listen to tv, sports, or whatever."
R3FHFP5KYV0H2I,5,"I had been looking for a good quality pair of wireless headphones for some time, and after reading tech reviews on cnet.com and user reviews on amazon, I decided to give these a try. I got a better price on this exact pair than I would have at the store, and I didn't have to go pick it up because even with shipping, it was still cheaper on Amazon. The unit took all of two minutes to install, and takes up very little room. It takes a few seconds to tune it, but after that, there are no problems with static or other interference. If you have the volume turned up too high, however, it will be slightly audible to other people (although to me, it's not enough to disturb). Keep in mind, this is not going to be THX sound or anything, but overall the quality is very good, and the range is also surprisingly good... that makes it easy to walk around the house during commercials and know exactly when your program comes back on. I definitely recommend these!"
RYS17EV8OMH2E,1,Sound quality is average or below.  This set is not dependable.  I had a set that I paid $35.00 for that lasted 4 years and worked perfect until the day they finally broke.  This set was considerably more expensive and you never know when they will work.  I can be watching a show and without warning will get blasted with static or just lose the sound all together.  I have called for a return authorization and will be sending the set back.
R35AGDVSI2J6F7,4,"Once we got the product working we were pretty happy with it. The instructions for the product are on the weak side and it took us a while to figure them out, but once we got them working they sound really nice. The kids like being able to fire up iTunes and walk around the house with the headphones on."
R3R7POKWSF0NUZ,5,"Product works great, and sound quality is excellent. Unless you get a defective set, I don't see how you could be unhappy with these."
R13QYUUNS2H9KM,3,"Like many other reviews, I bought these so I can watch TV in the bedroom and won't disturb my wife while she is sleeping.  And like many other reviews, I think these are not the best ergonomically.  They're kind of loose and the ear pieces don't really 'cup' your ears so they have a tendency to slip off if I get up and walk around.  I'm used to studio headphones that really cup them and lock in sound.  That's really the only gripe I have with them.  To me the switch and the volume/tune dials are just fine.  So... as long as you're just lying in bed, they're great, but if you need to move around forget it..."
R18THJIL6EJMG3,4,"Like others have said, these are great sounding headphones.  I didn't realize my TV could sound so good until I got these.  They far outshine my deafult TV speakers.  Also, yes the tune dial is right next to the volume like others have said, which can cause annoyance at first, but once you get used to it no problem.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is they tend to get some interferance and are sensitive.  I think for the money they are excellent and I am generally very happy."
R1Z2EJTYA9ALNQ,5,We are very happy with these headphones after a year.  My husband can watch t.v. without disturbing my sleep!
R2OZXK8UQ01JUG,4,"I gave these as a gift, but I did get to play with them for a short time.    The sound is very nice, battery life seems to be about nine hours, receiving range is >100 ft.  I don't see any weak points in design (for ruggedness).    A little more expensive than some of the other brands, but I don't regret paying the difference."
R3122UVWB2TJKA,5,I bought it after looking at other reviews -- looked at other products and this is really cool -- easy to install and clarity astounding.  Buy and enjoy
R1CNEH4O638NZG,2,It has static at low volume which is very irritating. You have to up the volume (which is deafening)to cancel out the static. Not expecting that from Sennheiser. Maybe I should have looked for a bluutooth technology.
R39WYF0Z9KFYJ5,4,These work great for watching tv and are comfortable on my big head.  I plugged them into my ipod and tried to blast Tool and that didn't work great.  It is nice to be cordless with the music and they sound good at medium volume.
R1897NPJP64AMM,5,"I bought two of these for myself and my husband because we have a baby and live in an apartment, and we wanted to be able to watch tv without making too much noise.  The reception is excellent, there is no hissing noise that I read some other reviewers mention.  It is actually very clear with no interference.  However, when we played around with the tuner, we were able to listin to out neighbor's phone conversation.  Overall, it is a great product for the price."
R1GM2YSFUW92A0,5,"We bought a new HDTV earlier this year with more hookups than we knew what to do with. However our new \\""toy\\"" can get very loud as my son plays video games or my husband watches Letterman late at night. NOT ANY MORE! With the Sennheiser Rs120 the boys can play and I can sleep! And the sound quality is remarkable, the lack of static is impressive, and BLAH BLAH BLAH... that's my husbands comments. As for me I just care about the rest that I can finally get, for as you know, we domestic goddesses must get our beauty sleep."
R1FY8PGX1Y7VIK,4,"We're using as many other people do: to watch TV while not bothering other people in the house.  We purchased two of them, and for the most part they are very good.    Pros:  - Very comfortable.  Ear muffs are a comfortable cloth design, not plastic or foam.  Can wear for hours with no problem, unlike others I've tried.  Adjustable band doesn't slip while wearing.  - Good (but not perfect) sound.  Good stereo, very clear, easily loud enough.  Open-air design means I can still hear things in room relatively well, which is good for holding a conversation -- while wearing the headsets -- without yelling.  - Convenient charging.  The transmitter/base station is also the charger.  Hanging them on the wire hanger of the base charges the headphones (there are two metal strips on the underside of the headband which make contact with the wire hanger).  Nice not to have to plug/un-plug a charger, and then have to find where to lay down the headphones so they don't get damaged or look like a mess.  The Senheiser solution is very nice.  - Good battery life.  I've yet to run out of a charge, even during long periods of use (a full day).    Cons:  - When audio feeding the base stations is very very low or muted for a couple of minutes, the base stations automatically stop transmitting.  This has the effect of the headsets going to just static noise at that point, which can be disconcerting.  - The volume and tuning dials on the side of the headphone are very near one another and feel the same, so easy to be untuning the headphones when intending to adjust the volume instead."
RWKLUHMD7K0DA,3,"I purchased these headphones to use at my office.  Unfortunately I was unable to use them due to interference.  I think the source of the interference was fluorescent lights.  I was also able to pick up some cell phone conversations.  I took the headphones home and they worked like a champ.  They have great range, long battery life and are very simple to use.   I would recommend if you plan on using at home."
R2E4RXX4DBML7P,5,"This is a wonderful aid to better hearing of TV without a mess of wires and blaring audio.  Neat , attractive stand and comfortable earpieces make it a must for  anyone hard of hearing. Great value!"
R11OHT6NZ35NM7,5,This is an excellent product.  Recharges by placing on the rack.  I can listen to my stereo from the backyard.  Sound quality is very good.
R2O12O2MMLZ1WF,4,"The sound quality is very impressive compared to the modest price of the headset. Reception is generally very good. Overall, I am very pleased with the product.   The one annoying thing... Every now and then, the reception cuts out for no apparent reason (I haven't moved from my location) and all I hear is this awful loud hiss. It's all that I can do to get the headset off my head before it deafens me."
R376YZDODCRG49,1,"I read the positive reviews for this product and made my purchase based on those reviews.  But this is a poorly designed product.  The overall look and feel of it is fine, but there is an \\""auto-shutoff\\"" feature that is incredibly annoying.  I use this product at my computer, and if the sound turns off for a minute (or if the sound becomes low, like you've turned down the volume so that the music is playing softly) the transmitter automatically turns off and you're greeted with a din of static into your ears at full volume.  There appears to be no away around this.  And, as others commented on, there is constantly a hiss in the background.  Was this product ever tested?  And what philistine thought the auto shut-off feature was a good idea?  Not worth your money.  If I had to buy again, I'd get one with cables."
R2XFMX8SRCGTYB,4,"I prefer the quiet, and my husband wants the tv on 24/7.  So, I purchased these for him as a compromise.  They work wonderfully, but when we moved and put a new tv in, we found they won't work with it.  We still use the headphones in the bedroom, but we are having to find others for the tv in the family room now."
R1VBAXG77J0Q17,4,"We recently purchased a tv with surround sound for our living room.  When that tv is in use, I'm not able to hear the kitchen tv, so I thought these might be a good idea.  Once you get them figured out they work well, but the instructions are minimal.  They are also made for big heads and slide off easily.  I will have to try the headband that one reviewer mentioned.  Another issue that I had was with the adapter that plugs into the tv.  The broad base didn't fit into the inset area on my Toshiba set and I had to order a 3.5mm to 3.5mm adapter with a narrow base to get the headphones to work.  At first I had a persistent buzz, but was able to correct that by turning down the headphone volume and turning up the tv volume."
RZBFBNEGE3IJZ,4,"My only complaint about these headphones is the need to manually tune them in sometimes (that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5). But that's it. They really sound clear with almost unnoticeable hiss, even at a distance. My guess is that the more expensive models in this family of headphones do a better job a tuning in to the signal."
R3LGM78AHC2303,4,"I bought this for my husband originally, but he couldn't take the headset falling off! Also the static that wouldn't clear up! We called Sennheiser and got the answer to the static!  Just turn the volume up and it catches the signal again! It works! I tried them and could't give them up. I did't realize how much hearing I had lost!  I can now hear all the talking on the T.V. and all the background noises such as birds, leaves falling off the trees and people walking.  I have found that the headset stays on better if I wear and sweatband."
R1391QUDJOLH7Q,5,"I was very happy with this product. It provides a good range for the wireless capability, I can easily work in my house without the signal being lost even once. Though there is a little \\""hiss\\"" sometimes, but that can be solved by adjusting the scanner. One thing I do not like about this product is that when the source volume drops below a certain level, the headphones cut-off automatically, and connect back only after a few seconds. This happens, for e.g., if the headphone jack connected to your ipod moves a bit. Otherwise, its an excellent product. The Noise quality is really awesome."
R2LSZRAC71DEQ4,4,"we live in a loft space where sound carries, and i am night owl, so after having our first child, wireless headphones were a necessity. i decided not to go with a super high end pair to start since i wasn't sure how often i would use them. so far, i have been happy with the senssheiser's. there are times when some unexplained static does come through, but it is easily corrected. i only use these headphones about once a week so any minor issues aren't a big annoyance, and the sound is great as far as i am concerned. i will say that if i knew i would be using these on a daily basis, i would probably go with a more expensive model that"
R9OA6E5O9C1M0,5,"This is a great pair of headphones - it's so convenient to use them when other people in the house are sleeping & don't want to be disturbed, or you need to run to another room to work on something, but would like to hear the news. They hold a charge easily - I'll leave them completely off for weeks at a time & be able to pick them up any time & use them without loss of charge! Very convenient. And the cushy head pieces are comfortable, but do allow you to hear external sounds (phone, other people) if you need to. I've had these phones now for 6 months."
RDJUXN1Y0UQC5,2,"I loved these headphones.  The sound was fantastic.  They were comfortable.  Then, one day, they just stopped working.  All I get is static.  A lot of money to pay for something with such a short lifespan."
R8FZTUBV80AT0,5,"These are way above 5 stars, but that's the limit given.  I use them at night to watch tv before I fall asleep without worrying about disturbing my husband, and without having his snoring overrun the show!  It's win-win.  We've also discovered, that with a sattelite system, we can turn the sattelite box in our bedroom to the same channel as we are watching in another room and the headphones work pefectly!  This comes in handy while our family wishes to spend time in \\""together\\"" but doing other things that the television will interfere with, like reading or using the computer.  Sadly, we can not purchase additional headphones for the unit because we've found ourselves arguing over who gets to use them now, because the sound is SO clear you get to hear EVERY step, breath and all the background discussions that, as middle-agers, we now miss with normal hearing.  The only true downside were the lack of instructions.  We would like to use them with our small video player while it is connected to the television, but that won't work for some reason.  Luckily, our son hasn't left for college yet and was able to figure out that we have to hook up the unit to the sattelite box if we want to hear television, but we're still trying to figure out how to listen to movies played on a VCR or DVD player.  Bottom line....BEST DEAL AND THE PRICE IS VERY VERY REASONABLE!!!!"
R1D9DJCEZD23DL,1,"i can never get the headphones to play in stereo.  I decided on these headphones because they were not a cheap alternative, instead I received a low quality wireless device.  not satisfied at all."
R34A68WDLW80IC,5,"I purchased this for my dad, who is a little hard of hearing.  With these headphones, he can turn up the TV as loud as he wants without blasting my Mom out of the room.  He reports that they are clear and comfortable and enable him to hear the TV even when he walks into the kitchen for a snack.  Peace in the family and TV room"
RSNCLFVT9V92Q,5,I really like the headphones!  Surround sound with the right amount of bass!  I'm getting another one!
R2I1MVXSZ0X24Y,4,"I bought these to use at my computer because I do not like the feeling of being \\""tethered\\"" to my PC. I find the sound of these to be very good and I do not have a problem with interference. BUT they are completely frustrating!<br /><br />First of all, they constantly slide off my head. It was so bad that I thought I had a stretched headset, and convinced Sennheiser to send me a replacement. The replacement is just as bad. Don't expect to use this if you plan to be moving around in the slightest. I'm not a head-banger by any means, but even bobbing your head to the music is a challenge.<br /><br />The second problem is that they often, for no reason, flat out refuse to play. The on/off light stays off despite them being plugged in and powered on. I have to go through gyrations with the power cord until they decide to start working. I'm not even sure if my fiddling with the cord does anything or if it is just random. Because of the replacement I received, I ended up with a second base unit and transformer, and I have had the problem with both bases and both transformers.<br /><br />Lastly, the auto-shut-off is very annoying. Often I will pause my music to have a conversation with someone and in the middle of the conversation I will get a blast of static noise in my ear when the transmitter turns off.<br /><br />Edited 11/13/09: I am still using these headphones 2.5 years after I wrote this original review, so they must not be as bad as I originally wrote. really, the sound is good, and they are very comfortable. I have not had the refusing to play problem lately, so I'm not sure what was going on there. I have moved them a few times since I was having that problem, so perhaps it was just bad location. Battery life has never been a problem and they are still going strong on the original batteries.<br /><br />I feel the 1-star rating I originally gave was unfair and am increasing it to 4-stars because I really do like these headphones now that I have gotten used to the quirks."
R18J2E0ZIBJ6HF,5,I purchased these headphones for my late night tv watching husband.  I was very tired of the volume changes waking me up.  This was the best thing I have purchased.  He & I love them.  He can listen to TV all night and it doesn't bother me at all.  It is very comfortable & has wonderful sound.  This would also be great for those who have to have the tv louder then the others would like.  I like that you can also watch TV at a volume that you are comfortable with or it can be put on mute.  We have this set up in our bedroom upstairs and are able to go downstairs and still get reception.
R3KG5FXAHW2UNL,4,"Even beyond the wireless, these are good headphones. Not quite in the same class as my AKG K240, but crisp, clean, good bass, and comfortable as well. About the same weight as the AKG, and without the bother of the cord pulling here and there.    About that wireless thing. Some tricks there, sure. Since I use them while working on the computer, there is a lot of potential electronic interference very close by. For the most part these things handle it OK if I drive max volume into them and then use the headphone volume knob as my main control. I do occasionally feel the need to fiddle with the tuning knob (couldn't they have made this crystal controlled??). When tuned they are reasonably noiseless. The farther I get from the base station, the more there are soft spots in the reception, I would not probably use them more than one - two rooms from the base station.    So, since I am using them for casual, quality, listening, and not studio work, they suit my needs quite well, thus the rating of 4. YMMV."
R1EGF0G90PTLXX,5,"Having been given the direction to \\""buy headphones or only use the PS3 when I am not at home\\"" I purchased a couple of the RS-120 Wireless headphones to save my happy home.  Now my son and I can play to our hearts content without resistance.  The RS-120 range is amazing (about 2 blocks around here)  I even use them to listen to stereo while I mow the lawn.  I have no complaints whatsoever!!"
R363AH0JXTZZRW,4,The RS-120 is a good beginners wireless. It has ok bass and tremble response and average midtones. Nothing really stands out. The Distance on this unit is outstanding. I can hear it clear throughout our large double lot in any distance.  The fit of the headphone is loose even on my big head and no adjustment of tightness is available. The adjustment is only up and down. So far so good.
RFLS07MSZSF3P,1,"What a horrible waste of my hard earned dollars this product is !!! First up, the headphones constantly refuse to stay put, they keep sliding forwards down off the front of my head. Second up, the random bursts of loud static and clicks and pops render this system useless no matter what the sound source or transmitter orientation, a simple A/B comparison versus a corded headphone told me a Radio Shack 100ft extension cord and a good set of headphones outperforms this setup by far !!!! I guess the one good thing I could possibly say about the Sennheiser RS120 is that it's range is excellent, 300ft of the same [...] !!!!!"
R3PKVMI5WPQ901,5,"I have used these for 7 months now, and cannot come up with a complaint. It's all positive--fantastic sound, comfortable to wear, and clear reception. I usually use while on my stationary bike in a different room than the TV. I also put them on to go down to the basement laundry room. No matter where I go, they deliver the same high quality sound. I was quite relieved after reading lots of feedback, both negative and positive, on a variety of headphones. I spent more on these than I intended, but I sure am happy I did!"
R2XZO2LQJTYRTH,2,"well, got the product and tried it, it has lots of background hissing sound,  to get rid of the hissing sound, seems like I will have to tune it slightly off, but then you won't pick up the good sound reproduction if you do that. So if you tune it so that it pick up all the instrument, it tends to have background hissing sound. ya, if you turn up the volume, it will \\""suppressed\\"" the hissing sound, but that is not a good headphone should do."
R2ACPI08G46SJI,4,"I am very happy with the purchase of these headphones.  The sound is great, very crisp and clear.  I have triplets and so I need to be all over the place all the time, and now I can do that and hear my shows at the same time.   Especially when they are napping and I really don't want to wake them, I can actually hang the headphones around my neck, hear the tv show clearly and hear the baby monitor as well.  Also, I have gotten absolutely no interference from any of the other electronic devices in my house, and we have plenty of them!  I was worried that would happen.  I would highly reccomend them to anyone looking for a product like this.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are a slight bit bulky, but not too bad.  I am glad I got them!"
R22DSFWAHS1MT5,1,"I purchased the RS-120 Headphones to use in my office. I work in a cubicle with alot of chatty coworkers nearby that are often very distractive. My objective was to block out their constant talking and listen to the radio instead. I first purchased a $10 radio headphone that was offered as a special offer from my credit card company. It was supposedly worth more. It worked fine but occasionally would cut out like there was a loose wire in the the headset and I would have to bang it on my desk to make it work again.   When I saw the reviews of the Sennheiser RS-120 Headphones, I tossed the cheap pair and went for the good ones. I was so excited to take them to work when I received them thinking now all my needs will be met.   Boy was I surprised when the headphones that cost me 6 times what I paid for the original pair was not able to get any reception in the building where I work! Nothing, nada, static only on all three channels!!!!!  I started the return process and learned that there was a 15% restocking fee and then I was going to lose my cost for shipping. On top of that, it was sketchy if I was getting anything back at all because I opened the box and plastic bags inside to take out the parts and wires and instructions, making it unsaleable to the next person. In other words, if it could not be sold as \\""New\\"" I was going to have to take a really big hit for trying this out.   So now I have it hooked up to my TV in my bedroom in case I ever want to watch TV and my husband is sleeping. (Not a real big need in my house!) I guess I should have checked the return policy before buying the product! I learned my lesson!"
R3LGR72SR33155,4,"Sound quality is excellent.  I don't notice any of the hiss some speak of.  The only thing I don't like is that because the ear part that goes onto your ear is rather large, it makes my ears hot.  Not because the headphones are hot, but just because they are rather large and it is like putting winter ear muffs on in your house.  I would prefer a much smaller ear piece.  But maybe they need to be large for the batteries? The charging craddle is very well designed.  Just put the headphones on their stand and they are charging.  There is even a convenient red light that comes on so you can be sure you have placed the headphones on the charging stand correctly."
R1BMRB5BWLK84U,4,"I use these headphones primarily in a home recording studio.  It is really nice not to have to have wires running everywhere when we are laying down a song.  The sound quality is excellent and I can go anywhere in the house with them on without losing the signal. <br />There is slight static or hiss occasionally but it can be removed by adjusting the tuning knob. <br />I would buy these again without hesitation, in fact I plan to get a few more sets."
R142TQN06HO0TW,4,"I got these headphones since I wanted wireless headphones for my office setting.  No more cords around the keyboards, I can get up and move around, etc.  Given the outside noises in an office environment, they sound great.  I would go so far as to compare them to corded headphones costing about the same price.  They have good highs, great lows (tight, not boomy) and a very good spatial sound stage. They can be a little bit finicky in getting the RF working, but the tuning knob has sufficient resistance that once you get the setting dialed-in, it stays set. <br /> <br />My only caveat is that they are a little bit top-heavy, so if I tilt my head forward (i.e. writing on my desk), they might slip off.  I've gotten used to it, but it is 10 times better than always having to move a cord out of the way."
R21POW5GIWLDVQ,5,These wireless headphones are the best we've had.  One step better would be the automatic tuning model.
R1L7EQNFGWQ58U,5,Sweet and simple: this is the way to go. Incredible fidelity and range.  Had a friend wear them outside and count her steps--125 strides.  Got fuzzy when she walked under a live oak tree.  Sweet!
R1V25WCHRV4U1S,3,"These headphones are a great concept that has yet to come to maturity. Often the static or interference over the wireless connection is bothersome. <br />The flat design of the ear muffs, no cup to allow your ear to fit into, make them uncomfortable for long wear periods."
R1O5Q9Y4WW4EJ0,4,"These headphones have performed as expected.  The sound is good enough, not great, and as others have commented, sometimes the connection will suddenly drop, and you will be treated to a burst of static.  Again, as others have noted, the headphones start to get uncomfortable after a half hour or so, but perhaps this is true of all such headphones."
R3I84H8ZT528UH,5,The only thing I found was that the headphones have a loose fitting on smaller heads. There is no way to really adjust the width; only the height of a person's head. The earlier model had a tighter it and would not slide off if you happen to lower your head. That is the only complaint. The fact that the batteries do not have a memory is terrific. My last set barely lasted 2 hours. The sound is also very good. I strongly recommend the headphones but they may wear lose on some.
R1R9VJYH0D8XTG,4,"This headphone works pretty good. <br />Just a few notes of concern but frankly not anything major: <br />The headset is little loose because it's a little too big. <br />when there is no signal, you will get noise if you keep the headset on. <br />The base is very light and tips sometimes when I lift the headset. <br /> <br />Now the good side: <br />for a wireless it produces very good sound. <br />I keep the headphones on and go room to room without any problem or interference. Sometimes I have it on for seven eight hours without batteries running out. Batteries are standard AAA size rechargeable. <br /> <br />If I had choice, would I buy it again? <br />You bet. <br />"
R3J3EQC5ZYANQM,2,"I appreciate the sound quality, but the comfort factor is quite poor. I have used radio shach wireless for about 7 years, and they were worn out. I bought the sennheiser as a replacement because RS had changed to a less quality version. The phones are uncomfortable and DO INDEED fall off if I bend over for any reason. They are also at a poor angle for my head/ears. I know the jokes that could follow, but the reader is not me. They are UNCOMFORTABLE. I wish they werent because there is nothing that I can do about it. <br /> <br />R. Tuley"
R986WCDW0IL25,5,"I simply love these headphones.  So much so, I bought another RD-120 for a family member.  I live in an apartment and didn't want to disturb my neighbors above.  Nothing more annoying than unwanted bass throbbing through the floor boards.  These headphones deliver fine quality and seem to have a huge range.  I've walked some distance down the street and still receive the signal.  By using a radio signal to transmit rather than blue tooth for instance means that walls and obstacles are no problem.  I use them with my computer, my TV and my ipod.  Adapters will fit anything.  I wanted headphones that were comfortable enough to wear for hours.  These do just that.  There is a trade off.  You can't be scrubbing floors or they will fall off.  But the upside is the most comfortable fit I have ever experienced in any set of headphones I've ever tried.  Couple of hours of music followed by a two hour movie are a cinch.  Recharges with ease on its cradle.  To date the charge has never failed me.  If it does, no problem.  I have a spare pair of rechargeable batteries ready to go.  Highly recommended.  These headphones totally filled the bill for me and then some."
R1SDOXY1VGEXLC,5,"I love this headset!  I have no problems whatsoever with it and use it constantly.  I love how I can just put it on its stand and it will charge.  Plus there isn't any special way to put it on, you just set it on its stand.     <br /> <br />I love the freedom that it gives me with my Creative Zen MP3 player (It includes the attachment to plug it in).  I hated the armband and was always snagging headphone wires.  These Headphones are big improvement."
R3L5BADJGNSVFT,5,"Earphones received in time promised and in excellent condition. When hooked up as described by instructions, no problem. They work beautifully can walk all-around my condo and not lose the signal. The sound is tops with good bass. Glad I bought them. Would recommend them to anyone.  <br />                                              Irvis46 <br />"
R22HXXV7K7LZCY,5,"We use these headphones to watch late-night TV without bothering others in the house.  I find the sound quality to be good, but I'm no audiophile.  I suspect an audiophile would be disappointed with any wireless headset.  They are perfectly fine for TV or an audiobook, and probably okay for most music listening. <br /> <br />Though bulky at first, I almost forget I'm wearing them in a few minutes.  They aren't anchored to your head, so if you're bopping around much they'll slide off, but for walking around, etc. they stay put fairly well.  We've watched 2-3 hours of TV without any battery problems, but can't say we've tested beyond that range. <br /> <br />We like our RS-120s enough that we purchased a second pair.  I can certainly recommend them for anyone wishing to watch TV without disturbing others and without being tethered to the set."
R21HGVJJ25698X,4,"I like these earphones because they are cordless, and it's so easy to recharge them because of the base they sit on. I have yet for them to die out.  I give it 4 stars for the following reasons;  The sound quality could be better.  Depending on how you adjust the recpetion there is alot of white noise in the background, or if it's ajusted then the volume is not as good. There have been times when other people's phone conversations are picked up, and when this happens you will have to unplug the base, turn off the headset to reset it."
R13DEZYP3I78WF,5,"I already owned a pair of wired Sennheisers and decided the only brand that could possibly do wireless justice was this one.  I can happily say that I'm not disappointed, and these have gone beyond my expectations.  I had been talking about buying a set of wireless headphones for years.  When our routine at night solidified into me watching X-Files on DVD and my partner wanting to settle down with a book, it became essential.  The quality of the sound is outstanding and I really can't tell much difference between a wireless set.  One note though:  I initially had the base setting atop my TV got a lot of interference.  I mounted it on the wall a couple feet up and now they're crystal clear.  I'm also amazed at how long the battery charge lasts.  I consistently watch about an hour of TV each night, and I probably have to charge them only once every 2 weeks.  They fit very comfortably also.  One thing I was concerned about since they're not close was sound escaping.  This is not a problem.  My partner can sleep beside me and not hear a thing. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a staple pair of wireless headphones, for the quality and price, these are what you're looking for."
R1HLQE96RL3OVH,5,Excellent product for a very good price. Easy to operate and maintain. It has brought back finer quality of sound back for me.
R3STDVW3JE59ZC,3,"Like most buyers, I was most concerned about the sound of these, since I'm using them at work where the building is blanketed with wireless signals of all frequencies. I'm happy to report that these are the best sounding earphones I've ever bought. <br /> <br />But the first thing I noticed when I took these out of the box was the construction isn't what I'd expect from top of the line earphones. It's nice that they are light, but the telescoping size adjuster thingies on the sides are not completely tight so they can jiggle. They also just look cheep and plastic-y. The base station could could be a couple ounces heavier too. <br /> <br />Also, when there's no signal from the computer and the headphones are still on my head I get terrible noises like aliens trying to communicate with me. It doesn't happen right away so it's as if the base station is doing the right thing and outputting silence for a little while, then falling asleep to save power. Either way, it's a bad experience for people like me who listen to an album or a TV show and then let it go to silence for a while. <br /> <br />I'm happy with my purchase because the sound is good, but I shouldn't have to think about the differences between wireless and wired except for fewer spilled drinks."
R4XFWJFVJMEGO,3,"A mixed bag <br /> <br />Pros: <br />- clever charging system, easy to use <br />- uses standard AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries, not some proprietary ones <br />- light and comfortable <br />- decent audio for TV or quiet background music <br />- decent stereo reproduction <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- high frequency hiss present on all channels and can't be tuned out <br />- weak bass when listening at higher levels to quality music sources <br />- lacks very low bass below 60Hz, turning up EQ leads to distortion <br />- overly bright midtones at times <br />- open air design bleeds a lot of sound so person near you will hear your music loud and clear <br />- looks like they're easy to break <br />- while the range is decent it picks up a lot of interference while walking around that results in distracting pooping, whistling and screeching sounds <br />- lacks some sort of auto-mute when runs out of range or looses tune: the noise that kicks in is oppressively loud and discomforting <br />- annoying startup delay <br />- volume and tune knobs too close, it's easy to  turn the tune knob by mistake and get blasted with that horrible noise - they should be on separate sides, far from each other <br /> <br />I'm still debating whether or not to return them."
R25101QJKE5D7P,5,I use these to listen to TV and DVD while working in the basement so I do not have to turn the volume up to be heard over tools I use.  They work great and the wife loves them (though she has not tried them) because she could hear the TV before and now cannot.
R28EVREDTVF4UO,5,I have had several pairs of headphones and the Sennheiser RS-120 are by far the best.  The sound is impressive and the range is all you will need and more.  The headphones are comfortable to wear and very easy to set up.  And the price is a good one.  I would recommend these headphones.
RSAXZ70BUAH9F,4,My first wireless headphones. I think the sound is very good and that the station functions also as a charger is a very useful function. <br />The only thing I don't like about these headphones are that they are a bit slippery. I have to pay attention not to drop the headphones when I bend forward even a little bit.
R35F1JCZKBD7SU,5,"My wife and I love these! They definitely help keep the peace around home. I can play video games, watch the other tv or listen to the stereo while I work around the house all without ever bothering anyone else. This is my second pair of the Sennheiser wireless headphones. The first pair I bought about 5 years ago were the earlier model Sennheiser RS-40 and they were great. My first pair fell off a second story balcony and hit the cement and survived a few more years.  The wireless range is more than adequate for a 2 story home and the new charger design and auto-shut off make these a 5 star item."
R2OR0O2TJJ0IE4,4,"I bought the 120s after looking at all three versions (120, 130 and 140) of these head phones and I regret not spending the extra $30 for the 130's. A coworker has the 130's and they really sound better. They both sound good but the 130's sound more natural and have slightly deeper tones. Also, the 120's are Over the ear instead of Around the ear, although they are very comfortable for over the ear. The only reason this is 4 star though is because of the sound difference. Other than that, these are excellent head phones... I don't think I'll ever buy anything other than Sennheiser now."
R5Z1ZZSOWFM64,4,"I bought these for my father, who is getting hard of hearing, so that he wouldn't have to turn the TV up when the whole family is watching.  They have worked great!!  The only problem is a repetitive ticking noise that appears sometimes.  We think it might be from a local wireless internet connection, though."
RGJZWJTDS1528,3,"I'm surprise no one has mentioned the auto-turnoff feature (more like a royal pain than a positive feature) to these headphones. Yes, the sound is good. When they're ON. However (and I wasn't aware of this when I bought them or I would have looked at something different) these headphones have an auto-turnoff feature that will turn the receiving base off in the middle of using them. *screeeeeeeeech*, the headphone base goes off and you suddenly have an earful of static. LOUD static. That makes you jump out of your chair. Flipping the on/off switch on the headphones themselves doesn't fix it. You have to unplug the base and then plug it back in again to get a new signal. Sound quality? Yeah, they're great. Being blasted with static in the middle of listening to something and having to unplug the unit to get the signal back? Very  bad."
R369CLDOAPSOMA,5,"I have some hearing deficit that makes me miss some dialogue and hate being tethered to a TV with wires. Looked at big box double letter stores and was suprised they did not stock much in wireless headphones. I read a lot of reviews like this and settled on the Sennheiser RS-120 (mostly because it was $78 (half of retail stores). For my use (sitting in a Lazy-boy) watching TV, they are perfect. They are comfortable, great sound and have experienced no hissing sounds when tuned properly. The cradle for recharging batteries works just fine. Great pair of headphones for the money."
R2KH1VZ5AAFE4R,4,This earphone provides good sound quality.  I can listen to TV when walk to another room.
R17YW2SH83AOYR,5,"I have used these headphones for the past two months and am endlessly pleased with them.  They took a few days to get just right--you can change the channel as well as tune them within a channel, so make sure to get the  settings right.  The sound quality on cable TV, DVD's, audio and so on is first rate...not quite as good as wired headphones, but close.  The range is excellent--sometimes I go outside and wash the car while listening to something (sports) that doesn't require every minute in front of the picture.  Great product."
R1EDIJYXTE9V52,4,"These headphones are good for late night TV watching or music listening when the family is sleeping. Quality is good and they work well throughout the house and outside up to about 30 feet. Sound quality is good, not great. The rechargeable batteries will save enough money to pay for the headphones in time. Although I am a large man, the headphones felt loose and sometimes fell off when I moved suddenly. Other than that I can find no faults.<br /><br />I highly recommend these Sennheisers."
R1BS372C79HHXY,4,"Excellent sound, but fits like most headphones.  I expecially liked the padding around the ears.  I thought it was a good buy for the price.  I use the set mainly for watching TV, so I don't wake my wife, and it works great."
R6XYOAYKDB38X,5,"I really like these headphones. I use them at night to watch TV while my husband is sleeping.They are light weight, great sound, can even listen if I leave the room. They charge easily, and seem to keep the charge for a long time. I just hang them on the charger, no need to plug it in and out. Only thing that could be better is the size. They are not huge, but if they were a little smaller they would work better lying in bed. The price is good too. I have had other ones in the past, and these seem to work the best."
R3UN2754RQRPHG,3,"I usually don't get more than about 10 feet from the base station, but sometimes I get some high-pitched whining noise, very annoying.  There's nothing I can do to make it stop, except take off the headphones.  Which pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones, don't you think?  Otherwise, when that whine isn't present, I enjoy using them."
R29S8NQ0M8C9O6,1,"I ordered one set of these headphones, which broke within a few weeks.  I returned them for another set.  This set never did work; all I can hear is static or erratic sound from one ear.  Don't buy these."
R3Q940759FEJMS,5,These are the best
R23CSZ5I41F1OH,5,"I bought this for my wife to use so she could watch TV in the bedroom, while I go to bed.  She says they're comfortable and the reception is great. She can walk around the house and the headphones still get good reception."
R1GTLLXFOUN270,4,These Headphones are good headphones. I wished the reciever was smaller so it could be portable but I use to them to work out on a treadmill so It works for me. Sound quality is great! Bulky Earmuffs but I guess you Have to take a few good and bad mixed. Overall I am pleased with  the Headphones. Sound quality means more to me than anything. These headphones give me that.
R123OSDVGUSQPR,5,These are nice wireless headphones. I like them very much as they are very comfortable on your ears. Quality of sound is great.
R3U5QDW8MW7FG,5,"My husband has used the Sennheiser RS-120 headphones at night so he doesn't disturb my sleep and is extremely happy with the performance.  They are comfortable to wear and the sound is crisp and clear. Also, the silence is golden for me."
R3CD8VABVO7IP8,5,The headphones fit very comfortably and have a great sound.  The three controls are small and difficult for an older person to use but otherwise it is an outstanding product.
R1A5K4CXOXWHL1,5,description of product as stated.  I have walked around my house with the headphones on and have had perfect reception to listen to my favorite movie or music.  Excellent product!
R1EZ7BV2AAL47I,4,"I bought the Sony MDR-IF240RK and returned them. They were absolute crap. These headphones are adjustable, rechargeable, have a manual tuning adjuster, good range, and good clarity. Highly reccommed to fellow musicians."
RVWRMY8DFYWQ0,5,"I have battled unwanted hissing and noise from my old headset for over 6 years, and it was a real pleasure to put on the Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones.  My wife has hearing problems, and she was really amazed at the clarity and the comfort."
R23JKWQOCVDTMA,5,"I bought these headphones as a gift for my father at Christmas '06.  He always had the tv turned up so loud, and we would go to sleep and the stupid tv would keep us up.  Anyways, these headphones are wonderful!  I installed them for him, which basically just needed to be plugged into the cable box.  The sound quality is better than the speakers on our flat screen tv and my dad can keep them on while walking around the house without any static.  He's gotten static once since Christmas, and all he had to do was rotate the \\""tune\\"" button to get the signal back to perfect.<br /><br />I recommend these 100%!!!  I must admit our living area is small, and his chair is close to the tv, so I cannot say how these would work in a large living room, however he does walk around the house and the headphones work perfect.<br /><br />Now he uses them at night and mutes the tv...the whole family can rest peacefully!"
R2S3PC5UF2M20N,1,These headphones did not work. I only got white noise or nothing. I tried all the settings and adjustments in the trouble-shooting section to no avail. I also found the headphones were not very confortable.
R3JBDB3QXS70CF,2,"The sound quality is very good, and its range is excellent.  However the construction and durability is way below average. I am afraid that if I don't handle it gently, it will break in my hands.  After awhile, the elastic head band starts to widen and begin to slip off my head."
RZENUZR3WMYXP,5,"I bought these headphones based off other reviews on Amazon for several different wireless headphones, including these.  I am quite happy with the decision I made. <br /> <br />These headphones are very clear sounding... very minimal amount of background noise, virtually undetectable when you are actually watching/listening to a TV show (I had an older pair of wireless headphones where the background noise was quite loud and annoying).  The controls are very intuitive and easy to use.  And, the price was quite reasonable for the quality of headphones received. <br /> <br />One note, for which I had to visit Sennheiser's website to find out - if the volume of the device your headphones are plugged into (i.e. cable box, TV, stereo) is 'too low' or 'muted,' the power light on the base station will turn off and thus the headphones won't work until you un-mute or turn up the volume.  In my case, I have to mute my TV as I have the heaphones jacked into the cable box.  This works just fine, and allows me to adjust the volume on both the cable box and the headphones to whatever level I wish. <br /> <br />Overall... great pair of wireless headphones, great price - easily worth a high rating. <br /> <br />"
R3LZ2C4LGQJ9SJ,5,"We have had these wireless headphones for a few weeks and are totally happy with them.  They provide great reception, are comfortable and we really like the automatic recharge, so they don't die on you during use."
R8Y41MHZRYJP7,4,"These headphones are very comfortable for long periods.  They are a bit loose for moving around excessivly, ie working out.  Auto on and off as well as charging stand nice features.  Nice range!"
R37ZK0XFGPP5W8,5,I purchased the earphones as a gift for my husband in January and he loves them. The sound quality is excellent. Now he can watch TV when he wakes up early and not wake me up! I have also used them a few times and now I want a set!
R25F1NFZXF0W3G,4,"+ : Range, sound quality, looks. <br /> <br />- : Fit (may fall if you move your head fast, not good for treadmill)"
R2UKBP05LB7WRG,5,This item arrived in excelent condition and the shipping was fast. i bought the headphones for Christmas for my husband. He loves the headphones. He is able to walk around the house and listen to music. He has even done dishes while wering the headphones. Amazing. LOL.
R3PY2PY6PEIZM5,3,Good:   <br />1. The sound quality is quite good for a wireless headphone <br />2. It is charged automatically when put in cradle <br />3. It uses RF rather than infrared. The range is decent. <br /> <br />Bad: <br />1. The construction is cheap. <br />2. The mechanical design is quite poor. It does not fit very well. It almost always falls off the head when you bend down. <br />
RQY23G00F3K8R,4,"PROS: <br />- Very good sound quality <br />- Light weight <br />- Very good batteries autonomy <br /> <br />CONS: <br />- small range of the radio signal: if you're at about 10 meters from the base in an apartment (where some walls always get in the way), you'll experience a severe loss of quality. <br />- rotative tuning knob in the unit: since it has only 3 channels to choose, it should be a key with 3 positions, just like the base. Maybe it's for costs saving (they avoid using a more complex and precise tuning circuitry). It's annoying to have the signal lost by accident when you're trying to turn down the volume..."
R10A7BQOE1MYC0,4,Product is what I expected & I am completly satisfied with my purchase.
R5NCS8JO8PVBK,5,"What can I say? These are awesome. They work well through walls etc. I use exclusively for television audio. No static at all, even when running 2 units at the same time in the same house watching 2 different TV channels. Highly recommend."
R1DRR95CCWUQ2X,4,"After trying out RCA and Sony wireless headphones (& being disappointed), I went on the web and started reading reviews.  The more I read, the more I wanted to try out a set of Sennheisers so I did.  After a month of use, I am still very pleased with the RS-120.  Yes, there is an ever-so-slight background hiss if you listen really for it but for TV use, they're super!  It was a good decision..."
RB6CNLSBD46XN,4,"I've been wearing these on and off all day. They're wonderful for listening to the music I've added to iTunes but just haven't had a chance to listen to in the past, since I can be anywhere in the house while listening. My son can work right next to me and listen to his music as I preview music I'm considering adding to my music library, and he doesn't have to hear it. I'm very pleased with these headphones. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that they're not as comfortable as I'd like. Kind of heavy on my little head! Love how easily they charge though! That's terrific. I recommend these."
R3480LELXXSRQ6,3,"These headphones have excellent quality sound, a little heavier then I expected but that's ok. <br />What I'm not happy with is that you are supposed to be able to move around within 24' of its <br />base, and you can't. I wanted to be able to listen to music while out working in my flower garden <br />that is 10' away from the base unit or cleaning around the house and can't do either because of  <br />static."
RKLGWSK1LY3W,3,"While these headphones offer unbelievable wireless range/reception and really good FM stereo sound - they are not for a quiet office or listening at night with your spouse sleeping next to you. Their \\""open-air\\"" design bleeds all the sound out of the headphones - so if you're listening close to even mid-level volume: your co-workers will hear and be distracted/annoyed by your music and your spouse will kick you out of bed. They are just too \\""open\\"" to use in a quiet environment where you don't want to disturb surrounding people. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />- lighter than they look <br />- super long range and and great reception <br />- easy to charge  <br />- sound like clear FM stereo radio <br />- crisp highs, decent mids <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- cheap look and feel <br />- transmitter base is ugly cheap-looking plastic with a tall gyroscope-yoyo metal thing to hold and charge the headphones <br />- weak bass <br />- sound bleeds out of headphones distracting those around you  <br /> <br />Unexpected amusing feature: <br />- adjusting the tuning enables you to hear people's phone conversations. <br /> <br />Overall: Get these if you need long-range wireless headphones that are loud and sound great and where disturbing others will not be a concern. <br /> <br />If you need wireless headphones for a quiet environment (at a similar price and quality) I would recommend the Sony MDR-IF540RK Wireless Headphones."
R16KDQ485D71F,5,I got these headphones about a month ago and they have worked well for me. The battery life seems to be very good and the sound quality is also good for wireless headphones. My two problems with these headphones are they are not as loud as conventional headphones. You also have to adjust the tune with a wheel on the side. This can be a pain. They come with all the cords you need to plug it into headphones or any other player.
RQNS64D2UD5M7,4,"Works pretty well, although headphones are a bit on the bulky side, and the unit takes up a fair amount of space on the table, or whatever you set it on."
R2PRNFIVQNN7RV,5,"The wireless headphones I purchased through Amazon is simply a great product through its usefulness.  My six yr old daughter found how to use it and my house is not on fire anymore. <br />The recharge feature comes handy and radio frequency vs. x-ray is a must, if you want to move around the house."
R16YRXXJ2Q8NA3,5,"This was easy to install and delivers great sound quality.  It has little static and lets me listen to the TV after hours without disturbing anyone.  The foam earpieces are more comfortable than the \\""leather\\"" ones supplied by the competitors.  Sennheiser is a name to be associated with top-tier sound quality."
R30SN2RYKKO6IS,2,Mine worked reasonably ok for about a week. I never could get rid of the background noise no matter how I positioned it. I was willing to live with that but then the unit kept loosing the signal. This failure was unbearable due to a screaching static noise. Unpluging then repluging the unit in would get the sound back. Perhaps I just got a bad one. <br />
R2OOV4EZSBTR08,4,"I bought this wireless headphone solely for the use of my computer as to not disturb my wife when she's asleep. I use to have a Sony corded headphone and didn't like it for a couple of reasons the cord as it limited my mobility and added weight to the headset and also vinyl cushion for the ear. If you don't take care of the vinyl it will peel and stick to your ears. It did give me a good laugh when my grandnephew put it on and large pieces of the vinyl were just hanging from his ears. I did notice the Sennheiser had a cloth cushion and chose the RS-120 based on buyer's reviews and price. <br /> <br />At first, I did encounter alot of problems with the headphones suddenly blasting snow noise or shall we say switching to \\""sleep mode\\"" after 2 minutes of use. It was really annoying having to unplug and replugging the headphone to get the sound back. I noticed only a few reviewers mentioned this problem so it must something on my part or otherwise the headphones are damaged. I thought maybe because of the recharging base was too close to an electronic device as the instructions warned. What I did was raise the volume on my computer (not the volume wheel on the headphone) and problem was solved. No more \\""sleep mode\\"" unless I wasn't running any programs involving sound. <br /> <br />I read people complaint about a faint sound of snow in the background. I did notice if you adjust the tuning wheel on the headphone, there seems to be a 'noise reduction' section. Yeah, the volume does suddenly drop but the snow does disappear so your choice which you prefer. <br /> <br />Couple of things I did find annoying about the headphone is that it sometimes slips off your head if you're not still. Even with my big head, looking up or down would shake the headphones loose. Also the headphone does on occasion to pick up ring-tones or cricket noises. I find it kinda odd even at 3am, but I guess not everyone sleeps early not even the crickets. <br /> <br />I haven't fully tested how long the headphones last without having to recharge it but so far it's good for over 4 hours. Sound quality is adequate for me. The range works find at 48 feet and through walls since that's my apartment limit. Oh wow, I'm picking up a phone conversation right now while playing around with the tuner. haha <br /> <br />At first I didn't like the product, but with the problems solved I'm pretty happy with the it now."
R1YN6ALW8FPVOH,2,The background noise level is very high (at least 4x more background noise than my wired headphones).  The wireless link also picks up noise from fluorescent lights and fades as I move around my room.  The headphones are comfortable and sound nice otherwise--it's a shame the wireless link is poor.
R276H8L5FEZCW6,3,"Usually it's great, but sometimes I just can't seem to get it tuned right, and sometimes, especially when watching a VCR tape, there is an irksome buzz or hum.  I haven't experimented with moving the transmitter away from the VCR, so this may be a problem that is easily overcome."
R2RRQQ81J1WE74,3,"I am keeping them, but...<br /><br />The headphones offer good sound but they're constantly in danger of falling off, ocassionally they pick up the signal from our home phone instead of the audio receiver, and if they are turned on before the receiver there is a loud<br /><br />HISS until the signal from the receiver is picked up."
R11D0NNO1CBCB3,5,"When I got these, I had been using corded headphones for movies, TV, and video games for about a year, and I really loved the jump to wireless.  No more tether to the receiver!  The sound is excellent, the charging system is superbly engineered, and they are really comfortable. <br /> <br />Some caveats: <br />- The base uses RCA stereo (red and white plugs) to receive a signal.  It comes with an headphone jack adapters (both mini and standard) if you would rather use that.  I was hoping to plug this in to my \\""B speaker\\"" port on my receiver, which outputs to standard speaker wire.  I'm sure there is something I could do about this, but it isn't really worth it.  As long as your receiver has RCA outs or you don't mind plugging in the headphone jack when you want the headphones, this isn't a problem. <br /> <br />-The reason they are so comfortable is that they don't press down on your ears with much pressure, but I found this also means that they can fall off pretty easily.  I had thought that I might use these to listen the the TV or radio while doing some cleaning, but they don't really stay on well enough for anything that would require a whole lot of movement. <br /> <br />All in all, a great product."
R29REX4UON5JMB,5,"I spent a lot of time looking for a reasonably priced wireless headphone for late night TV viewing and also my wife likes to walk around the house during the day with it on.  Last year I purchased a Sony at local store and returned due to static and poor reception.  I read several reviews at Amazon, and Sennheiser RS-120 had some of the best reviews for a mid priced wireless head set.  We have a larger home layout, and can go all around the house with this on, downstairs to the lower level, and not static.  Great reception, I would purchase again."
R1B20W7AA3HFJW,4,"This is my third Sennheiser headphone set and I am very pleased with the performance. I listen to a variety of internet radio shows and the wireless headphone allow me to do other things around the house and still stay \\""connected\\""."
R2TZ14DPRWOJBA,4,"I received these after trashing a wireless Sony product that was dissapointing to say the least. <br /> <br />The Sennheiser R120 comes with a rechargeable battery and all the cables you need to hook up to your TV or Stereo. Setting the headphones on the charging base is very simple thanks to metal-to-metal contact strips rather than tiny little points that you have to line up. Don't underestimate this feature. If you wear these at night while your spouse is asleep, the last thing you want to be doing is fumbling around in the dark trying to put the headphones back on the charging base. These make it a snap.  <br /> <br />The sound is very nice. Warm bass and rich treble make movies or music come to life. There is a very light hiss that you hear when you first put the phones on, but once you turn on the audio, you don't notice it at all. <br /> <br />I have a 2-story house w/basement and the base unit is on the second floor and I can still get good reception in the basement (excellent!). <br /> <br />My only complaint is that if you don't have your source volume turned up enough, the base appears to cut off leaving you with a loud ear full of static. The fix to this appears to be just turning up your source and turning down the headphones. Thus the 4/5 stars. <br /> <br />The R120 may be older, and low-end for Sennheiser, but it is really an excellent buy!"
R24N0M86Y7WBK9,5,"I must say, i am very much impressed with these headphones.  Quality and sound is excellent. Highly recommended"
RMPLDXSY5DP1I,4,"The base unit was easy to install.  Everything worked fine on the first try.  Sound quality is good enough for what I use them for--listening to the TV.  I have not tried them with any critical content so I don't know how good they are. <br /> <br />The headphones are \\""on the ear\\"" type.  I find them light and comfortable. <br /> <br />The controls (on/off switch, volume, tuning) are small and take a little practice to work quickly and without  looking. They work fine and with a few minutes practice I found them easy to operate."
R2FU6JRYKF3ACE,4,"This is my first wireless headphone and I think this has a comfortable fit, even after a couple hours of wear and have superb sound quality.  No fade or interference, even at great distance from the base."
R1FFD7YK39J3Z2,4,"The sound quality and range of these headphones is great! They were a gift for my husband and he loves them.  He likes to watch TV in bed and I can't sleep because of the sound. The only downside is if you have the volume up loud on the headphones, you can hear it.  So it doesn't cancel out the sound totally from the outside, but it is significantly dampened.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good quality, cost-effective model of Sennheiser wireless headphones. My husband also informed me that this brand is used in many recording studios. If it's good enough for them, it's definitely good enough for the everyday consumer."
R378INUEKXBRS0,4,"Have used them (RS-120) for 1 month, and so far have been well pleased. Had no trouble tuning them to receive signal. Battery life is GOOD. Sound quality is better than I expected. As long as they continue to perform this way, I would HAPPILY recommend them to my friends."
R26JVCRXA7A5YW,3,"These headphones sound great and work well when sitting still.  They are susceptible to cut outs when walking around, even well within the advertized perimeter.  The charging system seems to work very well, and they run a long time on a full charge.  The main complaint I have with this design is the fit.  There is no way to adjust the tension and although it doesn't become uncomfortable with extended use, it is not tight enough to stay in place if you bend over to pick something up.  I bought these primarily for yard work, and I have to tie them to a baseball hat to keep them on my head."
R2EG9Z8JNMLFYW,5,"I had the headsets up and running withing about 4 minutes after opening the box.  It was an easy set up, BUT I did find that having both the volume adjustment and the fine tuning knob, a little troublesome, being on the same ear muff.  It takes a little adjusting to...but that's easily overcome with use....other than that....I was surprised on the way that the \\""muff\\"" seals out the external noise but doesn't crimp your ear....nice concept (the stand being the recharger for the batteries).  I found the sound to be quite accurate in replication....bass had good response.  I checked it using STAR WARS EPISODE 1 and the fight scenes of the lasers were true as well as the rumbling of the \\""tanks\\"".  I really like this headset....it sits on your head very lightly.  NICE JOB SENNHEISER!!  I recommend them with NO hesitation."
R1UCF5EBR2DT88,5,"Just recieved this set of headphones today and am very happy with the product. It's nice not to have to worry about being tangled up in a cord when walking around.  The reception is great.  Setup was a breeze. If your are impatient, like me, and don't want to wait for the batteries to charge, you can use regular AAA batteries.  Obviously don't put the headset on the charger with them in.  At first I didn't get reception but changed the channel on the base and all is fine.  Great sound, not a lot of bass, but suitable for my needs.  The headset is comfortable, though maybe a little too big. <br />Great price, easy setup, great sound, great reception. <br />Just what I was looking for."
R1ZRID9D8R0JUD,3,"The unit I got arrived with only one of the two headphones working.  So far we have been unable to get an email response from Sennheiser.  Hopefully we can send it back (at our expense, I suppose) and get a replacement.  The one side that works sounds great, however. I think their quality control could use some improvement."
R3JPKWG5WTES3V,4,"I love these Sennheiser heaphones.  They sound great, wireless improved my outlook on life, and the price is sweet.  The heaphones recover their charge while resting on the wireless base station.  On the negative side, static sometimes intrudes when I'm wandering around my apartment (and trust me, it's a tiny apt!).  The other REALLY ANNOYING issue is that a few minutes after the music stops LOUD STATIC erupts from the headphones, prompting immediate removal.  This is extremely annoying and preventable.  Also, the foam ear pieces do not block out outside noise very well."
R3O77MKZ42P3SK,4,"I bought these headphones a while ago and they have been great.  Sound quality is adequate, i get next to zero static and the battery life is great too.  I would highly recommend this product.  It is a bit bulky though."
RGX71QRTUIJJW,5,"I purchased these wireless headphones for my spouse to replace an aging Sony wireless unit. The RS-120 meets and exceeds all her expectations. Sound is clear and has a nice balance of amplification in all the decibel ranges. The base charger is a strong feature as well. The headphones slip onto the base with virtually no effort. Also, the usage time alloted for a full charge is amazing. She can literally listen to her evening TV programs for several days without recharging. Controls are well placed and easy to navigate. These headphones are comfortable, according to her. They are a bit loose, but she prefers it that way, as the light fit avoids creating headaches. I found no noticable sound distortation when the headphones are in operation within about 50 feet of the TV, even when having to penetrate room walls. No background hiss is evident. I have purchased two additional headsets since the original order...one for our beach home for permanent installtion and use and another to have available when traveling. That should speak with authortity as to my complete satisfaction with the RS-120. One cannot beat the value at $75 per unit, free of taxes and free shipping included. This is an excellent product for those who do not require the advanced features of other more expensive Sennheiser wireless headphones. Hope this review helps when making your purchasing decision."
R3G37OS5CBB8YG,3,I found these headphones to be acceptable but they had a lot of white noise and are a bit larger then I was expecting.  They work fine and the volume and tuning controls on the ear piece are nice.  The charging cradle works well although you need to retract the ear cups back into the head piece to get it to balance on the recharging bars.  If they were a little more quite I'd give them a 4 and if a bit less bulky they'ed get a 5.
R1UC7CNRZU9ESG,5,"Just superb! A bit \\""touchy\\"" on tuning, but with care, a strong, low-static reception all over the house, and the simple &lt;hang up the headset to recharge its battery> is so convenient (just be SURE to SWITCH OFF the POWER on the headset when not in use, so the battery gets to recharge). Great price, fine item. Buy it!"
R3PNYFUA1LPF22,4,"Purchased the sennhieser 120's about 2 months ago and I am totally pleased. Range is awesome and will even go thru walls. I get about 40hrs on a full charge with a moderate volume level (about a quarter turn on volume control). The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the low frequency response, if you like lots of bass you might be dissapointed."
RCVDVXH9I5T9M,5,I have been using the headphones for about 2 months and I have found them to be the best I've had. They were easy to set up and I found them to very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is excellent and I have had no problem with interference. They are advertised as being effective within 300 feet and while I have not tested them at that distance I have tested them all over my house and the reception is consistently excellent. The only suggestion I have for improving the operation of the headphones is to increase the separation between the volume control and the tuner. Both these controls are on one side of the headphones and it is easy to inadvertantly move the tuner wheel and thereby detune the signal when you meant to move the volume control wheel.
R1I1MMC4KI02S3,5,This product was very easy to install and use. The sound quality is outstanding. We are very pleased with this products performance.
R3AP4DHNU094HM,5,We have now bought 4 of these headphones for presents.  Our parents who don't hear as well any more love them.
R38V8YWOOJIXJU,5,"Why didn't I buy these before? The tv is in the family room next to the kitchen - I complain of the tv, the kids complain of the kitchen noise. And these headphones were the answer. My son can even walk up to his room upstairs and hear the hockey game! They do leak sound a bit, so not good for someone looking for headphones to wear next to someone sleeping... but are fine for regular use. They also look big and heavy, but not so. My kids (preteens) find them comfortable."
R1TACOKO09486F,5,"I purchased these headphones in order to be anywhere in my 3 story home and and hear the music on my computer, or radio.  The headphones deliver just as promised.  I have had no hissing, or unusual noises, and can hear very clearly on any floor.  They are always charged and ready and fit comfortably.  I am most happy.   <br />"
RRSURTOOJFV7K,4,"This is my second Sennheiser wireless headphones. Since my first pair worked so well I did not hesitate to purchase a second set. The fit is comfortable, the ease of use with the charging station is a very good idea and the range is execellant.  But a suprising drawback is the buzzing in the left ear.  I followed all recommendations included with the instructions to decrease and eliminate this annoying sound but was unsuccessful.  So I disconnected the microphone in the left ear and all is well.  I got a great price for these else I would have exchanged them. <br />Would I buy them again...yes, they work that well.  But I'd buy locally in case a problem occurred again and I needed to exchange them."
R82YMG7X55HVH,4,The range is great. Tuning is a little delicate. Was picking up a phone conversation a couple of times. Changing the frequency helped. They have stopped tranmitting a few times. Turning the TV off and back on seems to reset it. Not sure if it is the transmitter or the batteries. When tuned in well the sound quality is good.
R3I2M5KV5EC6W0,5,"Works great, now I can have the TV sound at a normal level and my wife can hear it using the RS-120.  Sound is clear and without any noise.  She can leave the room and still hear the TV in another room"
R3E5KY4QCWGWW3,5,"Love it!  Very useful late at night when I want to watch TV or DVD and don't want to use the stereo system to disturb anybody.  Sound is clear, some static sometimes but is not annoying the least bit to me.  I'm not an audiophile that gets disturb by minor extraneous noises.   <br /> <br />Also useful when I am in another room doing something else and I use it to listen to music or the audio commentary on DVDs (no need to watch the movie over again).   <br /> <br />They are just a little heavier than I prefer.  Also the fit is not snug, you can't really move your head around too much, they slip off my head and I don't have a small head.  I use the tightest setting and still they slip if moving too much."
R3L09D8FIBW6IM,5,Absolutely perfect. A smart purchase. Did a couple of hours of research and price checking before deciding on these though. :)
RAISGEDGVHBWE,5,This is by far the best wireless headphone I have tried.  Great sound and the range.  I can walk around any place in the house and get good reception.  It even works outside the house.
R2RKMDMW0XTSYG,5,"I love these headphones. I ordered them to use with my electronic Yamaha piano. In researching headphones, I could never find a review for use with a piano (or even a keyboard). First, I purchased heaphones with a plug-in cord, but that just was not practical. Next I tried a less expensive one that was wireless. It was infared and light weight, but there was a great deal of distortion in the upper keyboard range. Finally I found the Sennheiser brand that advertised clarity. I debated about the size as well as the radio-wave versus infared (fearful that it would go through to the wireless telephones in the house or to the neighbor's house- hasn't been a problem). When the headphones arrived, I wasn't sure that I wanted to keep them just because of the size, but once I put them on and tuned them in...wow. It was wonderful. They are not heavy like they look like they would be. There's no distortion in the upper range, and how simple could it be to just lift them off the charging cradle and flip the little switch (the cradle fits perfectly out of site behind the music rest on the piano and I never have to worry about charging them). The sound is just like I'm in a concert hall. It's wonderful. It's also been great for my husband to use to practice on his banjo. The open sound enables him to play along with an instructional backup cd and still hear himself play. It's great for us both. It'd be nice if they were just a little smaller, but once they're on your head you don't really notice that. Overall, I think they're fantastic."
R2X8IPT0L07JH6,1,"I bought an RS-120, it does not work on my LCD TV.  The manufacturer instructions indicate that \\""some TV's can cause interference which can be eliminated by increasing the distance between the transmitter and the interference source\\""; this did not work on my RS-120.     I called Amazon for advice on getting the product to work and they indicated that they could not help and to contact the manufacturer.     I contacted the manufacturer, Sennheiser, by e-mail on Dec 18, 2006 and Dec 26, 2006  immediately receiving an auto-generated e-mail indicating that they would be \\""review my inquiry and contact me\\"". I never heard from them.    I contacted the manufacturer, Sennheiser, by phone on Janaury 3, 2007  and was put into a voice mail indicating they would contact me.  I never heard from them."
RTHSGOF17RV3O,4,"Pros:  <br />+Long battery life: Place headphones on the base stand and it will recharge the batteries everytime! <br />+Good sound quality with little to no RF interference. <br />+Long wireless range (about four average houses down) <br />+Very rugged (a little bulky, though) <br /> <br />Cons: <br />_Base auto-shutoff feature will create an unpleasant sound in the headphones until base receives a audio signal again. NOTE: Headphones don't auto-shutoff. <br />_No Line-out on headphones. (for wireless communications to other audio devices) <br />_NOT recommended for those who like it loud. <br />_No headphone onboard balance and mono controls. <br />_The sound will bleed from the headphones at medium volume which can be heard from across a quiet room. (not recommended if partner is asleep while music volume is set to medium) <br /> <br />Overall: It's worth the price. <br />Wishlist:  <br />*I wish Sennheiser design a unit the size of a cellphone with a beltclip that uses Koss earbudphones instead of headphones with the mentioned features.  <br />*I wish it can \\""signal\\"" headphones to MUTE while base goes into standby."
RKHFC3SL6X5YL,5,"I bought this set for my 73 year old mother as a Christmas gift, and let me say that she just loves them to death.  Her hearing was so bad that she would blast the tv at physically painful levels, and she still couldn't make out what was being said.  Now she can hear everything clearly, even dialogues where the people are whispering, and the headset volume only needs to be at a normal level.  She finds them very comfortable...she even fell asleep in them the first time she wore them.  When she woke up, she kept the headset on, and I didn't notice any ear rubbing or redness when she took them off to go to bed.  When I woke up the next morning, she was already wearing them to watch the news.    I also tested the headset before giving them to her, keeping in mind the complaints from other reviewers, and this is what I found:    These phones may not be a good choice for hardcore audiophiles, but for your average, run-of-the-mill consumer this is an excellent headset for the price.  The sound quality is good with television viewing, and I only noticed hisses/pops when the headset wasn't receiving a signal.    I'm not sure what the issue was with some of the other reviewers' setups, but I can mute the television, or lower the volume to 0 and still maintain a good signal.  (I did need to increase the headset volume a little when I went to 0 on the tv, but muted doesn't affect the signal at all.)    Neither of us have put the 150 foot range to the test, but my mom claims that she can still hear the tv from the back of her 60 foot trailer (the charger's in the front), and when she goes outside to get the paper.  The power cord for the charger is more than long enough for my purposes, and the headset settles into its cradle almost by itself with the earmuffs contracted.  If you keep the muffs extended, you will need to do a jiggle here or there to set it in place.  The phones are very comfortable with a lot of cushioning and a loose grip.  This may not be good for people withsmall heads or who will be active while wearing them, but for me, I tend to get headaches with high-tension muffs, so I like them."
R1EZ0NC6UVPGGD,5,"I bought these headphones for my husband, we love them. We have satilite TV and these work great. There was a problem with the transmitter adaptor,almost returned them for this reason, it did not fit properly in the space for the jack on the TV and the sound would just stop. We filed the rubber part down a bit so the plug would fully engage, now the sound never goes out. No buzz or hiss. We can go outside and all over the house, we can still hear the program. Great sound and comfortable. These are our first set of wireless and they are even better sounding than our wired pair."
R1SV93VO03U1TB,1,"Annoying hiss.  No bottom to the sound, like an AM radio.  I am very disappointed.  My $20 Koss headphones sound so much better.  This Xmas gift is going back to the store."
RSPJV8FJMKLTS,5,"These headphones have it all. Comfort, style, price, range, quality sound and functionality. You need these RF type wireless headphones to use everywhere in the house and outside. The other type only work in one room."
R10E8S4E1F44IU,2,"The unit works beautifully, but the sound is not as good as my Sennheiser Noiseguard headphones. <br /> <br />It is great fun to walk around the house and listen to music without bothering anyone, but the headphone fits poorly and offers little adjustment for headshape. As long as I keep my head up I am OK, but when I lean forward they slide off. Maybe it is my head (mostly bald, but it is pretty big so it should inherently fit snugly)."
R18V2HETIJEZP5,5,"These work very well, good sound and wide range. Work anywhere in the house."
R1JDLN93WSBQCB,5,"Perfect! Perfect and clear sound, long battery life. Receipt thru few walls at least. Charging idea is great - never in problem to recharge )compare top others where ytou need to place headphones firmly). Save battery a lot - doesn't work when no input signal. <br />Recomend A+."
R2PGZ00WP1H8F8,5,The headphones work great.  I wear them throughout the day at my desk.  The sound comes through crystal clear.  I've got four computers situated on my desk top and we have wireless connections throughout the building.  I have not noticed any interference with the wireless headphones.
R3VIIRCWWYL9TH,5,I have had these since XMAS day and man they are awesome.  I can walk 2 houses down before interferance.  I can check the mail with no interferance.  I can cover the whole second floor of my work (Tested it... probably won't take advantage of it) without static.  I have no issues with quality of sound.  For the price it's unbeliveable.
R3C30WXVUS9DD2,3,"When I first bought these headphones, I was in Tennessee, at a cousin's house. Every time I used them, they would cut out every 182 seconds - like clockwork. A 2-3 seconds break in transmission, and then they would resume playing again. This is my first piece of wireless equipment, and my conclusion was \\""wireless sucks!\\"" <br />However, when I brought it back home with me to Barbados, and used it with my computer, I got no such problem. So I started to believe that maybe there was some kind of interference in Tennessee. But one day I plugged them into my TV, and I got the same break in transmission. The moral to the story: this product does not work well with some electronics. I am not sure why. <br />Apart from that, they are okay. There is the hiss and pop that others have complained about, that increases with distance from the base. But from fairly close it is minimal, and I find it is cool for watching movies on my computer. So overall I give it 3 stars."
R2SOKD0SOCMGKY,1,"After endless searching for a good set of wireless headphones - I read decent reviews so I gave them a try.  During the first use, they would lose power for no reason. . .they were a Christmas present for my Husband, and they are going back."
R23LLR0AYC19ZE,4,"This headphone is of better value than some alternatives.  It stays connected all the times. (Better eletronic circuits). The sound is clear and beautiful. High pitch performance a little better than the base (have to do with the size of the cone I believe).  There are some hisses when the music is not playing, but it does not bother me much.  If someone is really bothered by this, add another $100 - $200 to buy the next version up."
R20VSZAMZ4GHO8,3,"When I first purchased these in Dec. 2006, they seemed to work great but all of a sudden they were failing very often.  I even re-wrote my review as extremely unfavorable.  I was ready to send them back and/or have them serviced by Sennheiser and as I was in touch with them I did get to speak to someone in their service department. Although he didn't seem to care about the failure of his company's product...much less my displeasure with them, but he did tell me how to fix it.  I was using them but adjusting the volume via the TV. He said if the TV is too low, the headphone base is trying to sense the signal and will cut off if it doesn't have a loud enough signal.  His suggestion was to turn my TV volume up a little higher than I normally would and then adjust the volume on the actual headphones.  PROBLEM SOLVED!  They've been working perfectly since.   <br /> <br />However, I still don't \\""love\\"" these because they're pretty bulky (but very comfortable) and if you tip your head over to tie your shoe or pick up something off the rug, the weight of these headphones will cause them to slip off your head so you find yourself holding them with one hand if you tilt your head for any reason. That seems kinda ridiculous. <br /> <br />Would I buy this type again?  No. And not because I don't think they're acceptable but because they're too heavy and I wear them when I'm cooking or cleaning up the kitchen and they sometimes will want to come off my head because they're too heavy.  Good luck to you all."
R2JUVS7KTWNIHW,1,I didn't realize the rechargable batteries had to charge before 24 hours use. I took these to work and after many tries I finally got it to say it was charging. But had to unplug it for the weekend. Monday morning. It won't charge or work no matter what I do. Very disappointing. I won't get another and I am returning this one for a refund. The batteries are put in the headphones and the headphones have to rest on the metal frame of the stand for it to suppositely charge the batteries. Poor design.
R11IDMU759B9B5,4,"Comfort supreme. Sound is transparent and full at lower volumes (on the headset). Perfect for the office environment. They don't \\""CRANK\\"" without hiss, but for enjoyig music in your cube they are perfect. The sound quality is superb. All the suckers that bought \\""noise supressing\\"" cans, after listening to these, wonder how the Senheiser RS120's were under 60 bucks. Open air baby. No need for that closed headphone crap unless you are a D.J. or on a flight. It all depends on what want to hear, the real thing, or some muffled equilized dung ball."
RXYIQDJXIQN4P,4,"I purchased the Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones about two months ago.  I bought them and use them for when I'm on my home treadmill.  They are connected to my wall mounted television and enable me to listen to the TV at a comfortable volume without having it disturbingly loud for the rest of the house during my workout.  The range is perfect in my setting, as I'm only about 8 feet from the transmitter when working out, but I have wandered my whole house with them and they worked great throughout.  I have not really put the rechargeable batteries to much of a test, as I usually use them for about 45 minutes and then they go right back on the charge stand for the next workout a day later.  Overall I am very pleased with the sound quality, fit, finish, and function of these headphones.  They would probably not be my first choice for sitting down listening to hours of stereo (though the comfort would be fine for that) music, as they don't have that full a sound, but they are perfect for TV listening."
R226R7F9IJQAKY,5,"These are so great and what amazing sound quality! I can hear the sound from the television better than ever.  I stay up very late at night and now I don't have to struggle to hear, esp in summer when the AC was running.  The recharging cradle is so much more convenient than worrying about batteries.  If you get any feedback, try tuning them in better, turning the sound on the television way down.  You have to fiddle a bit to get things just right.  For me, television sound itself is down to zero, cable box and headset are at medium levels.  Fully charge them before using.  I thought there was going to be a lot of background buzz at first but when they fully charged and I got everything set right it was gone.  I have also picked up phone calls when tuning in, (probably a cordless 2.4 gHz)"
R1CNGBWE6Q3GJ6,4,"I would probably give these a 4.5 if Amazon would let me, but I'll have to skew lower on the grading curve than higher. <br /> <br />These babies are beautiful and function very well.  It's an easy setup - you plug in the power, use the headphone port adapter if needed (as the regular cords output to L/R white and red audio), and put the phones on the base to charge.  It'll charge, and when you start to play music, it will automatically turn on the phones (provided you've turned the switch on the phones themselves to the on position) and begin broadcasting. <br /> <br />For the most part, all of this works without issue.  The first thing I noticed - and this isn't really explained in any documentation - is that there's no on/off indicator.  There's charge and (I forget the exact word) broadcast.  Which is somewhat confusing at first, as I wanted there to be indication on the charging base itself.  A stupid move on my part, but oh well. <br /> <br />Second problem is that the tuning will be a little more annoying than I'd like it to be - i.e., the auto-tune feature of the RS-130s (the set that is a step above these) might be more worthwhile than I thought (and thus skipped out on).  It doesn't take much to tune to your music, but it's annoying juuuuuuuuust enough to make me notice it.  This goes hand in hand with the fact that sometimes you'll lose signal (even if you're not moving) and it'll make a loud annoying \\""snow\\"" sound. <br /> <br />And then there's the last problem - the infamous \\""falls off your head\\"" issue, which is sometimes augmented to \\""falls off your head when you lay down.\\""  True, the headphones dont' clamp down on your head, but they are tight enough.  You just need to be aware that they will slip off if you move too quickly. <br /> <br />All in all, these are wonderful headphones and I'd definitely recommend them.  They are stylish, the ear covers are a soft fabric (not foam!), they work well, and are the perfect solution to keeping music personal andhassle-free.  I imagine I will use them for years until I decide to get a higher-quality (read: more expensive) set.  Highly recommended, just not the end-all be-all solution."
R1I7MS3O6R8XLT,5,"This is the best product ever. I can walk two rooms away and still get perfect reception. The sound is amazing, it will feel like you just got new ears and have never heard real sound before. The only complaint I have is the headphones shut off after about 10 minutes or so, to save battery life. They do this when you are surfing your computer, but it takes ten seconds to shut of the sound, so it really isnt that big of a deal. Outstanding Product!!!"
R6OS8Y467SQUC,5,clarity of sound is good.  Battery lasts longer than we thought.  We have enjoyed the product.  Great buy
R1FBDXQ4GDEV4J,5,My wife likes to watch Barbara Striesand movies.  Some of them I don't enjoy.  I like to watch things she doesn't enjoy.  With the ear phones we can each enjoy our evenings without disturbing the other one.
RXVV1YVOA53PE,3,"The sound quality is excellent. One drawback was the headset slips off the head. If you want a wireless headset go for a bluetooth headset so that you dont have to have the RF transmitter. I got a Blueant X5 and am very happy with the sound and no wire and no transmitter freedom. I later bought a Sony MDR-V700DJ, a wired one, to just blow my head off."
R2LBTBYY21YC16,4,"Headphones sound great, wireless range is great, and owning two of these products makes it good for my wife and I to watch programming such as horror films or movies with lots of bad language when the kids are asleep.<br /><br />My only quirks are sometimes the reception can have slight crackles in it and if there is no sound for a few minutes, the headphone base shuts itself off giving you loud static in your ears.<br /><br />I own two of these- one base goes in the computer room, the other in the living room. When on the computer at night, I tune the headphones to the computer's base headphone. When watching a movie, we tune the headphones to that base.<br /><br />I can wear these headphones longer than I can wear most other types. Great job in the comfort area!<br /><br />These would definitely make a great gift to others or yourself."
R1AGMOHC1ZNRIW,4,"Have been using Sennheiser wireless headphones for more than ten years. They are great for TV, our house is very peaceful! The earlier models (mostly plastic) suffered from difficult controls and brittle plastic causing premature breakage of the headarches. Fortunately, I dealt with the Good Guys (now defunct), who honored my purchased extended warranties without a hitch four times. Maybe that partially explains why they went out of business! The rechargeable batteries on my RS-45's finally died of old age, so I carefully studied Sennheiser's latest and finally selected the RS-120's. Best phones I ever got for the money. No problems whatsoever with installation and operation. Mine hiss only if I move too far away. I honestly do not understand what the low-rating cry babies are complaining about. Congratulations, Sennheiser!    Here's a quick follow-up on the above:    We are now in late May, 2011 and I had to replace the 3 RS120's due to old age. Got 2 new ones and clearly there have been significant improvements since 2006. These have a much better snug fit on the head; The control buttons seem to be slightly larger, making operation easier than before. I detect no hiss whatsoever, even if I move from the living room to the kitchen or office.    Now the sad part: I sent Sennheiser an email several days ago, offering them my 3 old units at no charge for recycling or refurbishing. No response whatsoever! It seems like so many other manufacturers Sennheiser is only interested in maximizing profits and to hell with environmental considerations. Oh well."
R2AQN0AI463YK9,5,"These headphones have excellent sound quality (no hissing). The sound quality is the same even though I walk to the other end of the house. The headphones are lightweight and comfortable, even after using the headphones for two+ hours. No sound bleed outside of the headphones."
R36JIAWVPATWYM,4,"I bought the headphones as replacements for my old wired pair of Sennheisers. The base is small enough to place it just about anywhere in my office. The battery life is far more than adequate. I can only complain about the size of the headphones, which is somewhat bigger than most in the market. Also, every now and then, as I turn the volume up/down the stereo sound becomes mono. A slight movement of the knob corrects the problem."
R3T7F6T9JBEHAQ,4,"This product is wonderful. But i do have a couple complaints: <br />1. The headphones are badly designed so much of the sound is lost because it doesn't flow well into the ear. <br />2. The headphones slip off rather easily because they dont conform to the ear. <br /> <br />These are my only complaints, otherwise they are wonderful."
RT8J99PAUHVM4,5,"These headphones work great all around the house.  I can even use them when I am outside doing yard work while the base sits in my living room!  Sound quality is very good, but there is a slight hiss most of the time that is noticeable when audio is quite.  Far better than any other wireless headphones I have tired in this price range."
R8MDJTPZVEHEI,5,These headphones not only remove the sound from your TV but they sound better than the TV!
RSU61K89421WE,5,"I have been enormously pleased with my purchase of the Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones.  The sound is excellent, little or no static unless I am over 75 feet away from my TV.  The sound is true, without distortion and it has made a world of difference to other family members because the volume level can now be much lower.  I would recommend these headphones to anyone who has difficulty hearing the TV or stereo system when played at normal or low levels or just for the privacy of listening without disturbing anyone else.  Thank you Sennheiser.  When replacement is needed, I will definitely replace mine with Sennheiser headphones again.  Kathy Hopkins"
R343FIZREKDNUA,2,"These headphones have some good points:  comfort, easy set-up out of the box, good directions, and they are attractive.  Unfortunately, I hear a constant HISSS  when wearing them. Not always a loud hiss, but always detectable, and sometimes quite annoying. This may be the nature of the FM signal.  Also, I get about 20-30 feet from the base & I start getting annoying interference (I would estimate the range to be just shy of the distance from my sofa to my bathroom).  Last, if the phones don't detect a signal, they go to LOUD WHITE NOISE!!!!!!!!!  Don't try muting the commercials!!"
R327NHEFODIJ4P,4,"95% happy with this product. Only complaint is the way they fit to my head...a little loose and if doing anything but sitting in my chair, have to be careful that they don't fall off."
R3MB9M51WD6TRU,1,"I returned this item after it would spontaneously shut off every 3-5 minutes while I watched TV.  I received a replacement and it did the same thing.  I was very disappointed that these both were defective or not compatible with my TV.   <br />When it was functional, it worked fine."
R1FO93VZ7PWQSX,1,"I wanted these so badly that I ignored all the reviews that discuss hiss and background noise.  Even worse, the right speaker goes in and out.  All of the noise is also in the right speaker and it comes and goes (but never goes away). <br /> <br />I've tried all of the adjustments over and over again in the month I have had them and I give up.  I wasted $70 and am now looking for good wireless headphones.  It's nobody's fault but my own.  I didn't \\""listen\\"" to the reviews."
R1I2G028RPGQDK,1,"The right headphone speaker goes in and out. The headphones fit poorly; actually drop off my head if I bend over.  There is no red light on the headphones to tell you that they are on.  Neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old, cheap Panasonic ones. If I go into another room ~30-40 feet away especially if there is a wall between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference. UPDATE-Lowered Star rating-after time you find the tuner and volume control mechanism start to fail-still using them but it is a royal pain. If someone changes settings then you can spend half an hour trying to re-balance the tuner and volume wheels. The only positive note is that my off the shelf rechargeable batteries work fine.<br />UPDATE: I COULD NOT STAND THEM ANYMORE-I bought new headphone that are working-Audio Unlimited SPK-9110 900MHz Wireless Stereo Headphones (Rechargeable)"
R3ND7SERNYODBG,3,These headphone do what they say they'll do.  The sound quality is completely adequate for TV/movies/etc but nothing exeptional.  The range in this house is limited.  Could be the wireless network or the phones or the microwave or the neighbors.  If I get more that 30 ft away with a wall or window between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference.  Occaisionally I hear other peoples phone conversations on the headphone.  Nevertheless I'm pretty happy with them and I'm sure my wife and even the neighbors are happy I no longer have to turn the TV up to 11.
R24533DPLZAZO9,4,"After wrestling with the tough decision of which headphones to purchase, I settled on these. I love them! I use them with my stereo, and I haven't had any problem with hissing in the background. There is a dial right on the headphone to adjust the reception to get clear sound. I can walk all over my house and not lose my music. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is (as another reviewer pointed out) the headphones--although very comfortable---come off my head when looking downward. Overall I am very pleased with these wireless headphones!"
R1ZJ1S01XL3G2A,5,"I spend quite a bit of time listening to podcasts downloaded onto my computer.  Until I bought this product, I felt that my computer had me on a short leash.  Now I can wander about and do many normal household tasks while listening to my podcasts. <br /> <br />This wireless headset works beautifully and is comfortable to wear."
R32KU0S64QZ3YI,5,"My wife's idea of watching TV is to turn it on loud enough to hear it across the house and then do other things while listening to it in the background.  This bugs the crap out of me.  I avoid TV like the plague and I especially don't want to hear it in the background 24/7.  My logical arguments and rational reasoning did nothing to pursuade her to turn it off and listen to something else like say commercial free classical music.  Anyway, as a last resort I bought her these head phones.  It worked like a charm!!!  This model was probably overkill for TV listen but I was desperate and didn't want to take any chances.  I would definetly buy another pair if something happen to these.  The sound quality is fantastic and the range is far better than I expected.  The signal is clear as a bell all the way out to the street.  She doesn't even turn on the TV anymore.  She tunes in the channel she wants to listen to through the DVD/VCR player.  No more unnecessary heat production and power consumption.  I don't even know it is on.  Can't say much about the longevity as I have only had them for 3 weeks.  But as of now I recommend these head phones to anyone in a similar situation."
R2CBRJ2YUG3QO0,3,"The first one I received had a defective volume-control. It was scratchy and you had to fiddle with it to get sound in both ears. I returned that and received a replacement. The replacement headphone is fine except when I put it back on the base, the battery doesn't charge because the charging contacts don't sit properly on the base contacts. I have to put an additional weight on top to get the charging light to come on. <br /> <br />The headphones sound great but I'm sorely disappointed by the shoddy build quality."
R1AIX4AGPKEHVM,4,"I think they're great. Way better than my last set from Sony. I don't know why people are complaining about a \\""low hiss\\"" these are wireless headphones, there is going to be interference no matter what. Plug in a wired set and the hiss will go away."
RZUZ3CTTWYRW3,2,"The sound is OK except for a persistent hiss in the background. <br />I've tried all 3 frequencies multiple times and it's always there. <br />Especially bad when there is little to now sound coming through the phones. <br />And if the music ends and you still have them on your head a minute or so later, loud screeching and hissing sounds assault your ears until you turn them off. <br />I wouldn't recommend this product."
R2E7TD4FSIOD9,4,"Excellent set of headphones for people who listen to music or video only occassionally (2-3X/week), but does have a low hum of static noise that would disturb the afficionado. Great range...I can take this anywhere within 100 to 150 feet and have decent sound. A little bulky and can get heavy on the head after about an hour or two. Good product overall...."
RUGPEAUNXBZ7Y,5,"Like many have said these are great sounding headphones with good build quality. The ability to recharge them by just hanging them on the stand is a good idea and the sound quality is excellent for something this price.<br /><br />I think the equipment works on the 900mhz frequency and it is capable of picking up one half of a conversation on a 900mhz cordless telephone. Because the phone works on two similar but separate channels you won't get both sides of the conversation. I was surprised to hear the neighbors coming through the headset when I had my PC (the sound source) turned off. If you use a newer 2.4ghz or 5ghz phone this won't be an issue, but if you have a 900mhz baby monitor or cordless phone there might be some bleed through. Luckily there is a fine tune wheel on the side of the headset and you can lock your own signal in. Oh the whole very impressed and worth 5 stars at the price."
R10CVMGVQ45J31,5,"Being over 70 with a hearing problem, I want the TV louder than do others in the house.  So with some research from my son, I got these wireless headphones.  Not only is the sound clear and the volume adjustable to whatever I want, there was an extra bonus!  When wearing them and working around the house, even going into a different room or outside a short distance, I can still hear my program just as clearly as if I were sitting on the couch listening.  Definitely 5 stars.  They did all I wanted them to do plus more."
R195DE1BO6IZ13,4,sound is good but ear pieces not very comfortable
R2GPWPTT39NINF,4,"These headphones have been a pleasure to use overall. They are very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. The sound is very clear and I can go anywhere on my second floor with no loss in sound quality (I use them in the upstairs bedroom). I have not tried going down to the first floor. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have had is that they seem to pick up other faint signals. Sometimes I can hear what sounds like other people's phone conversations. I have managed to keep the extraneous noises at a low level by careful tuning. The sound from the TV show I am watching also drowns out any other noise. Note that there is a three position tuning switch on the transmitter as well as a tuning wheel on the headphones. This gives you some flexability in tuning. <br /> <br />Also, take care to turn the on-off switch on the headphones to the off position when you are finished using them. This will avoid running down the rechargable battery. Placing the headphones on their stand recharges the battery. <br /> <br />These are very good, very clear sounding headphones at a nice price. I think they would be particularly nice for people with a hearing problem, but my wife and I just use them to let one of us listen to the TV while the other reads. I would give them 4 1/2 stars if that were available."
RYLG0WA77JYFS,2,"I've had these for about a month now and have used them every day.  I walk all over my house with them (3800 sq ft) and down to the mailbox, but there is a loud \\""shhhh\\"" all the time.  I have to adjust the tuner to an in-between, mono, not-as-much-volume-available place in order to hear stuff. (Like when you pull the headphone plug out half-way.) I listen to a lot of audiobooks & talk-radio, but lots of music too. I read several reviews before buying these, and no one complained much about the noisy background.  On a plus side, you've got no wires and I wear them for hours without my ears hurting.  BTW, I have kind-of a small head and the smallest setting on them is still loose.  I can't look down or they'll fall off.  Grand Total: I wouldn't buy them again."
R1VPFR564846SP,4,"While my wife was on our cordless phone ,I kept tuning the headphones until I could both her and the person she was talking to ....Be very carful talking on your cordless phone about things you don't want everyone to know about."
R11SSKNJI3TZ25,2,I recently purchased these headphones and will be returning them because there is just too much interference. Will the RS-130's with the auto tuning feature fix this problem or will I just have to go with corded?
RMRJJVI1Y9V5Q,5,"this is the second set of wireless headphones that I tried and these are really great.  Sound quality is very good for wireless, just a bit of a hiss.  Anoying static when the base unit decides to turn off, but it comes back on again immedately when the computer makes another sound.  The dial tuning is a great feature, and the battery usage is not too bad.  They are very comfortable, but a bit heavy. <br /> <br />A bit more expensive than the lower end models, but now I know why.  I won't go back."
R3I7VH9XAP9D7X,4,"Pros:These wireless headphones work exceptionally all around the entire house. I have walked from the third floor to the basement with no loss of reception. <br /> <br />Cons: The Bass response does need more presence as others have stated, and the fit is very loose with no means to adust them. If you are just going to sit they will work perfectly, but if you are using them while excercising; they do have a tendency to fall off. Hopefully they will fix this design flaw. I would definitely buy again  <br />"
REJ00T52SDXH5,5,"I have had these headphones for about 2 years, and so far I am very satisfied with them.  I use them to mostly listen to programs Tivo has recorded whilst I cruise around the house taking care of chores and such.  Makes such chores much less painful to do.  The only tiny quirk is you will quickly learn that when you place the headset back on the base, to make sure it's hanging correctly (ie, touching the metal correctly) and the red charging light is on before you leave.  I have several other Sennheiser wireless headphone models and love them all."
R2IULG2O2962VR,4,"The only reason I don't rate these 5 star is a previously mentioned issue with falling off your head when you bend over. However, I will take the inconvienence over the alternative.<br /><br />One review mentioned hiss and white noise but I was able to eliminate any with the proper adjustment of the source volume, head phone volume and tuning.  It took some expiermenting and time but with my set I was successful.<br /><br />I also use a set of RCA and ADVENT wireless headphones, the Sennheiser are superior.  The RCA are good quality but excessivly bulky and the Advent hurt my ears after 30 min or so. I have used the Sennheiser well over a year and even the rechargable batteries are still doing great, combined with the ease of the charging method make this a \\""Best Buy\\"" in my mind."
R3L6JDJP5225TF,3,Cons <br />A little overpriced. <br />I was somewhat dissappointed in the hissing (white) noise that is discernable in quieter passages. <br />They are a little heavy and will fall off your head if you bend over to pick something off the floor. <br />Pros <br />Better than average (not for the price) sound quality. <br />No wires!!!!
R233LMAVI83LEZ,3,Does anyone know if I can have 2 of these running off different audio sources in one house at the same time?  Is there a channel adjustment or something?  Anyone tried this?
R2L39SK2IIGLUU,5,"I get home sort of late at night, and like getting on my treadmill. The thing is, I need to distract myself with tv to get in a good workout. Unfortunately I needed to turn up the tv extremely loud in order to hear it over the treadmill, which I don't think my condo complex neighbors appreciate at 10 or 11:00 at night. Enter the rs-120 wireless headphones. This is the first set of wireless that I have owned, and was a little nervous that the electronic treadmill would interfere. The reception is perfect for what I need it for - the tv comes in great. The set fits comfortably and stable while I run. It also stays charged forever! I keep them hanging on my treadmill, not always sitting on the base. I have only recharged once in 6 months, and then pretty much only because I was cleaning and moved them. The only issue that I had the first time I used them was that the channel I had them on picked up my neighbors phone conversation. Kinda freaks me out that they could be doing the same! Nothing too juicy was said, though :), so I just changed the channel on the headphones and ran."
R1RRXFSB3P7AVL,4,"The Sennheiser RS-120 headphones work great.  I am actually using them with my Sirius satellite radio boombox.  When tuned in properly I have no problems using them while mowing my yard on a riding lawn mower.  The yard is over two acres so I get a decent distance away from the boombox which I set up outside and only occasionally will I get some static when I get far away from the radio, which is expected.  It is great to be able to listen to my Sirius while mowing.  I was using a set of Radio Shack AM/FM headphones, but got annoyed with all of the commercials on regular radio and the static from the stations since I live out in the country.  This option was cheaper than buying the S50 Sirius radio, plus I get to listen to live programming.  If you turn up the volume on the boombox, like other reviewers have mentioned, I have no problem getting enough volume to hear the music over the sound of the mower.    Don't expect to get Bose quality music out of the headphones, but the quality is still very good combined with the distance you are able to get from the transmitter.   <br /> <br />The only reason I gave these four stars was because no matter how far they reach, you always want it to be farther.  That and they could be a little smaller.  Those are the only complaints I have.   <br /> <br />I would recommend them to anyone."
R2AD65G0836U26,4,"The headphone provides good to excellent sound quality. However, it tends to slip away from your ears quite easily."
R10HMS1207XVND,5,"Delivery of headphones was received within 48 hrs.  My husband and I have used RCA headphones for the past two years.  They served us well but since one set had to be taped together and the other only had sound in one ear we decided to find a different product.  After researching the different brands and prices we decided to order the Sennheiser RS-12o Wireless Headphones from Amazon, as the price was considerably lower than offered by anyone else. Since using my headphones I now realized that the sound quality and the distance I can wander away from my TV and still have great sound is far superior than our previously owned headphones. I highly recommend this product"
R27JS9GHZPBD9Z,4,"A few of the negative reviews from other buyers are so unreasonable.  This product does what it is supposed to do.  Some people do not have the least amount of common sense.  If you use low volume to the input, you end up amplifying the static noise as well.  In order to get the noise floor lowest, you have to have the highest gain thus better Signal to noise ratio.  No static range of the unit is good.  It is so funny that a reviewer complains it is not good for using in her bed room because the unit gets on her way of falling asleep aside.  Didn't she see the picture before purchase?  It is a mistake of her purchase decision.  Ridiculous to see some people blame others for own mistakes!  The quality of the sound is no where close to audiophile quality headphone.  It is not even the same level as Sennheiser Noise canceling headphone PXC300 but that is what I expected anyway.  I paid so little ... less than $70- ... at Amazon clearance price for brand new unit. I did not pay tax or shipping charge. I use this for night time TV viewing in bed.  I am not returning it.  If I will find better one in the future, I will just add not replace. Good product if you do not expect $300 performance for the $100- unit."
R2FSKKHRH1U1K6,5,"I work in a cubicle in a noisy, open office environment.  When I do creative work, I enjoy putting on wireless headphones to block out the background noise.  I've been using an inexpensive set of headphones from Radio Shack, with lukewarm results.  Limited range, persistent background humming, and uncomfortable headphones were my main complaints. <br /> <br />Looking for an upgrade, I bought the Sennheiser RS-120 headphones.  Wow.  What an improvement.  Roaming the cubicle, the sound is clear and consistently background-hum-free.  The headphones are rather large, but very comfortable.  The batteries recharge when you set the headphones on the base unit. <br /> <br />I believe these wireless headphones are a good value.  I've had them for only a few days, so I can't comment on long-term reliability...  I give the headphones a big thumbs up!"
RSOOIV6EWAPGH,2,"I loved the sound I heard with this headphones. It's superb.  <br /> <br />But it's too big to wear. Forget trying to wear while you are half lying in the bed at night and watch TV, which was the whole point of buying this headset so that no one is disturbed while you watch TV at night. <br /> <br />Put you head against pillow and it will pop out of place. So I tried my recliner but same outcome.  <br /> <br />I guess it's fine if you are standing while you watch TV or if you are listening to music only while walking around your house. <br /> <br />And if your head is of average size, you are out of luck, there is no way to tighten it, you bend down & it slides out of place. You need bigger head that will make it work fine I guess."
R1Q4BQR6ERA5M2,3,"An update as of Jan 2010:  (Problem with the attached RCA cable).  The cable has turned brittle over the years and has cracked open in several places (especially in the areas that has been folded).  At first I thought that it was because I caught it on something, but it's all over the entire cord!  With this problem, I reduced my review to 3 stars.<br /><br />Blows out my Sony MDR-IF240RK which cost more!<br /><br />I've been very frustrated with the Sony model that I've had for a couple of months due to static noise.  I've tried everything from moving the base unit as far away as possible from the TV and other elctronic equipment (using a long Audio extension cord), to putting the darn thing next to me beside the couch.  No dice, it only works with the volume turned down very low.<br /><br />After reading reviews on wireless headsets, I was convinced that ALL OF THEM had massive amounts of static and I was very hesitant to buy another.  However, the Sony was driving me crazy! .. and wife insisted that I wear headphones at night while I watch my action DVD flicks and the loud (room shaking) booms that comes with them.<br /><br />I saw this on Amazon, and after reading all the good reviews .. I decided .. what the heck .. if I didn't like them, I could always return for a refund or excange.  Amazon has been very good to me in this manner, and of course that's why I keep coming back to them.  LOL, between my wife and I .. we must own a piece of Amazon by now.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I am pretty amazed by the quality of this unit.  The sound is excellent and I can go anywhere in the house, in the garage, outside and the sound is as clear as a bell .. and most of all, no annoying static.<br /><br />A little clarification:  You WILL get static if it's turned on and there's no sound source feeding it.  In other words, you must start your DVD player, CD Player, TV or whatever, before turning on the headset!<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  Same complaint as the other folks who said that the headset was bulky (yup) and they don't fit quite snugly around the head.  I guarantee, it's not one for laying on your side because it's not too kind on the neck.  Also, I guess I have a pretty small head and I really have to fiddle around to adjust it so that it doesn't fall off.<br /><br />The ear pieces could be designed a bit better, maybe just by using a thicker and softer concaved material so that it completely surrounds the ears.  Perhaps they didn't want to make it even bulkier, but it sure would make it more snug fitting and comfortable.  I would be willing to spend an extra $20.00 to have this feature because the unit is that good!<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is definitely a KEEPER, inspite of the minor irritation of getting the headset on the head just right and the bulkiness.<br /><br />THIS JUST ADDED: (April 17th) after the initial review.<br />I was unhappy with the earpiece that came with the unit so I did some modifications.  Ahhh, much improved!<br /><br />I had an old Kloss headset that had some very nice and comfortable earpads, soo.. I removed the pads from the Kloss (they were just lightly glued on to the ear piece plate), and exchanged it with the Sennheiser.  The Sennheiser earpieces goes on and off easily.  They just twist off and on, and the pads aren't even glued on to the plastic ear plate. There is a thin foam cusion that just lays against the plastic plate and a cloth that works like a fitted sheet that slips over the foam pad and the lip of plastic ear piece.<br /><br />I took the existing thin foam pad out of the Sennheiser and replaced it with the contoured THICK pad from the Kloss.  Then I slipped the cloth back over it twisted the ear pieces back on the headgear and I was off and running.  Took maybe 15 min.<br /><br />The contour and size of the Kloss earpieces are almost exactly identical to that of the Sennhiser so that made the job much easier.  The hardest part was removing the (gluedon) foam pads off the Kloss earpieces.  But with the extra thickness of the new pads, it fits quite snuggly.  Cool!<br /><br />Note:  You can probably just buy some thick foam from your local Home Depot and just cut out an extra layer using the earpiece plate of the Sennhiser as your template.  Then place the extra foam on top of the other, and slip the cloth cover over both of them.  You should have a more comfortable, better fitting headset.nuggly.  Cool!

R1TWTH5GS2DOMM,2,"I had previously owned RS 45's and they were lost.  RS-120 looked good, so I ordered online.  Have always hated them.  You bend over, they fall off, they do not enclose the ear, they sit on it, very limited range in my home.  I am going to order another set of 45's, even though you must handle carefully as they are fragile.  But are far more comfortable and seem to have better range and less hissing in my home anyway."
R131KLXSCR99MU,5,"I just received these headphones and I love them. The sound quality is really good (to my ears) and they are really comfortable to wear as well.  <br /> <br />The 2-RCA interface provided worked really well for me because I connected it to the (Tape) audio out of my home theater receiver and now I dont have to get up to plug in the phones into the headphone jack on the receiver everytime I want to use them. Also, some reviews mentioned that the 3.5mm / 1/4\\"" adapters were missing for them - but it was not so for me. I do have the adapters in the box so I can connect it to other sources without running to the market for wires. However I dont really need that - the interface with the receiver works really well for me.  <br /> <br />Some reviews also said that these phone are not loud enough. Not so for me. Even before I can turn them all the way up, my ears started aching! <br /> <br />Really great product. A bit pricy though.  <br /> <br />"
R1UNDBKLNPJMMP,5,The rs- 120 headphones do everything i wanted them to do. I would not give them five stars if they were not great.Good team work Amazon and Sennheiser !!!!!!!                             <br /> <br /> <br />                                       Thank You
R20208MMRX85I4,5,"Very nice,crystal sharp wireless headphones.Have a long travel range and the built in charger is a plus. A good buy."
R148MPMJ7XICAB,1,"The Legendary Sennheiser name has bitten the dust.  These sorry excuses for wireless headphones fail on all counts.  Don't waste your money.  If there is anything at all in your house that can interfere with the signal put out by these pathetic pieces of plastic it will.<br /><br />Any other brand is better.  Heck, a kids toy megaphone put to your ear is better!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Wait...I have to slice a large piece of this humble pie I have just baked...After letting what I considered \\""these lemons\\"" sit unused and unreturned (too damn lazy) for months.  I suddenly got a bug to replace my whole theater sound system and included a new Harmon Kardon receiver in the mix.  Then I started looking around for my wireless headphones until I remembered the Sennheisers...and said what the hay...and plugged them in because I wanted to watch The Fast and The Furious to test the limits of the system...and lo! there was sound.  Glorious sound!  Reproduced in all it's surround sound glory.  I moved about.  I went upstairs.  I went to the mail box.  Everywhere I went the sound went with me.  I do not know what was wrong with my previous setup when it comes to this particular set of headphones, only that the interference was somehow in my system,  but I was too hasty and severe in my judgement of them.  They are wonderful.  How's that for a reversal?!?  It's certainly a very big bite of this humble pie.  Unfortunately editing will not allow me to change my star rating!!!!!"
R2ZKNNGUOYX7MW,4,"I watch my TV/DVDs and listen to music mainly late at night, and always find it unsatisfactory to do it at low volumes for obavious reasons. Since the listening distance is long (4 meters), I wanted a wireless headphones and the RS 120 does its job well. <br /> <br />The setup is a breeze. The fit is comfortable, though it gets a bit warm after 30 minutes (I stay in a tropical country). <br />The souund is comparable to that of HD 497, which is no mean feat. <br />There is no hiss/static at my usual listening position. However, there is a noticiable hiss when I go upstairs to my study to do my computer stuff (no diff if computer is on or off), which I cannot get rid of no matter what I do. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this is an excellent buy."
R1O448JEOG3FRU,4,"Just got my pair in a few days ago, and I love the headphones.  Sounds is totally clear throughout my apartment without any static or fading (the transmitter location was very important, by the way -- too close to my computer speakers and the reception suffered).   <br /> <br />Frequency response of the unit could be a little better... bass is somewhat bad, actually, so those of you who want to feel your music had better go with another unit, but midrange is excellent, very clear, and high treble is pretty decent, too.   <br /> <br />Batteries have lasted over 12 hours now without recharging, and still I have great reception.   <br /> <br />The headphones are fairly comfortable.  I haven't worn them 30+ minutes yet, but the time that I had them on, I didn't mind the feel at all.  Earpads are soft, too.   <br /> <br />All in all, I'm happy...."
R3QHC5VXVNARDU,5,"I looked at many options for headphones to wear in bed while watching TV, DVDs, etc. so that I wouldn't disturb the rest of my family. I ended up buying these and couldn't be happier. Previously I had used a LONG extension cord and some old earbuds, but these over the ear models give far superior stereo sound, are extrememly lightweight and comfortable (and adjustable), and the battery charge lasts many, many hours. The charging stand is elegant; you just drop the headphones onto it, and they begin charging through the contacts. No fuss at all. The headphones have a volume control and a tuning control. Once tuned to a clear frequency, the sound is pure and hiss free. I have been using them at a distance of about 12 feet, but have wandered into other  rooms with them without loss of signal or quality. I highly recommend them."
R3L6FCJRR3W086,4,"I was impressed with the sound quality. The background hiss that others have complained about is virtually unnoticeable when the headset is properly tuned. The charger is as easy is placing the headphones on a stand, and the range is fantastic. I can listen from anywhere in my house or on my property.  My set came with an RCA to mini adapter (look through your box carefully, it's taped to the underside of a cardboard insert), but the adapter has a very wide base which made it impossible to plug directly into a television that has a recessed headphone plug. An extension I had on hand resolved that problem.  My biggest gripe is the insecure fit. I like snug fitting headphones, but these are very loose. Bending, stooping, or exercising results in frequent adjustments and constantly steadying to keep them on your head.  EDIT Update:  I'm just ordering my fourth pair.  The first three are still working great, but my cat got it into his head to tear the padding off one set.  So, I'm replacing that set.    As mentioned above, these headphones are quite comfortable and they have a loud volume, but they are loose fitting.  They sit over your ears, not around them.  If you wear them doing anything that jolts your head, such as running on a treadmill, they will slide off.  For issues with static, if you have more than one base tuned to different channels, you may need to mute the source you are not using.  I have three set up, two on two separate computers and one on a TV.  Sometimes when I switch between the TV and a computer, I have to mute one or the other. Not always.  Also, learn where on the tuner dial each channel is tuned in.  I've been using these headphones long enough that I can tune each channel nearly instantly. You could even use a touch of nail polish to mark the correct position once you figure out how to tune it perfectly.  If you are slightly off the proper setting, it may sound okay for a few minutes, but then the sound will either cut off or get static andyou'll need to re-adjust.  It just takes some getting used to."
RN145AZP2FSD6,5,"Fantastic reception, great range, batteries last quite a while. Wonderful headphones, I would recommend them to anyone. Amazing quality for the price."
R2XX4MAV5XFK7Q,5,"Before ordering this headphone I read very carefully previous reviews. The reviews I read were helpful, well written and I was stimulated to write my own. There were basically two groups of reviews, one being highly complimentary of the RS-120 and the other group complained about noise, hiss, and comfort. My own review falls in the first group. However I must say that noise and hiss can happen in some environments and are not necessarily a problem with the headphone. In fact, it is easy for me to induce noise/hiss when I approach the motor of the refrigerator or I approach the emitter from other electronic equipment. Noise/hiss are nightmares for engineers and sometimes there is not much that we can do to eliminate these problems in the immediate physical world that surrounds us. We need to troubleshoot to get the best location of the emitter in order to enjoy this remarkable set of headphones. And the price at Amazon was a real bargain."
R2STW3AIAWP5S6,4,"Before you get all excited with all of the 5 star reviews, I'd recommend you read the following: <br /> <br />Now, before I begin that, for the price, these headphones cannot be beat. The design is absolutely wonderful--it's obviously Sennheiser did their homework on design and the base is very cute and functional. <br /> <br />With that, I'd like to add some negatives that some of the other reviews, may or may not have mentioned. <br /> <br />1) There IS a noticable hissing sound at pauses/low volume music/movies.  No way to get around this. <br /> <br />2) The headphones are designed to be FLAT and not ones that surround your ear. However, they are much more comfortable than my Sennheiser HD497s, but noticably less comfortable than my HD590s. <br /> <br />3) The bass is REALLY lacking on these headphones. Please don't believe what any of the other reviewers are saying. I am no audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but the bass is almost non-existant.  The highs and mids are great, but the bass needs work! <br /> <br />############ AMAZON USER WARNING ############# <br />4) The unit DOES come with an adapter, but the design of the splitter makes it INCOMPATIBLE with most Logitech speaker headphone ports and (some) Dell laptop computers. You may have to go out and buy another one from radio shack! <br /> <br />I thought about returning them, but every time I look at them and think about wireless music, I change my mind! <br /> <br />@@@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@@@@@: <br />AMAZON HAS RAISED THE PRICE BACK TO $99 from $69!  <br />Be warned! <br />@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"
R304FW3HOF80SF,5,"After using my first pair for the past 6 months, I have decided to buy another set. I have my current set connected to my computer. The second set will be connected to my surround system so I can watch it with my 56 inch Samsung DLP TV. <br /> <br />Now with two pairs, two people can watch the TV without waking up anyone else in the house. <br /> <br />The range of these headphone are very far. I can go into my garage, and empty out the garbage without missing any of my music as I listen to my music collection on my iTunes. <br /> <br />The base charges the batteries without any problems. I am still using the original batteries, and they still hold a good change so I can watch several movies with doing a rechange in between the movies. <br /> <br />I'm sure you will love this headphone as much as I do. With the price, you can't go wrong."
R1CY6SBUS7MO0,5,My wife bought these headphones for me last Christmas (2004).  I was thrilled and surprised.  At first I did not think I would use them that much but I use them all the time.  I use them at least 3 hours everyday.  They have held up extremely well.  The batteries are still holding a charge.  Sometime the reception is not what it could be.  You can certainly walk around the house freely but you will experience static in certain spots.  Duh....it's wireless so you will have some sometimes.  But 10 feet from the movie or ballgame is perfect always.
RUEGZZWI1KWGS,5,"I like the RS-120 wireless headphones. Light weight, comfortable, good sound. Work well on my treadmill. I like the fact that I can simply place them back on the attractive stand and they are automatically connected to the charger. I do not have to connect a charger cord. The instructions say that they cannot over-charge. They are expensive, however."
R1X2AIKDET60AH,5,"I really rely on user reviews when buying unfamiliar technology, so when I was tempted to by a cheap IR wireless headset, I started reading reviews.  I quickly decided to go with RF instead of IR because I wanted to walk all over the house, outside, etc.<br /><br />But there were tons of choices.  The reviews kept taking me back to the Sennheiser RS-120, so I bought one.  They are great!<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is great. I can walk anywhere in the house or in my backyard or front yard, and there's no problem with reception.<br /><br />What I really love is the way they stay charged.  The headphones are equiped with rechargeable batteries, and when you drop the headset back in it's cradle, it charges automatically.  Two hidden metal contact points in the headband automatically make contact with the metal points on the charger, so you don't have to plug them in.  They are always ready.<br /><br />Now my wife wants her own set."
R3674BKNUALAPC,3,"This is the first product review I've written on Amazon, but I really felt the need, because I felt somewhat deceived by the huge amount of 5 star reviews for these headphones.    Don't get me wrong, these are decent headphones.  I am satisfied with them and I will not be returning them.  But there are significant problems, the biggest of which is the ubiquitous hiss.  Contrary to many of the other reviews, I found this hiss to be *quite* noticeable.  I suppose that is just a fact of life with wireless headphones, but it really is quite annoying, particularly during quiet passages or when stretching the limits of the range.    Speaking of range, it is true as other reviewers said that you can still get a \\""reasonable\\"" signal at a remarkable distance (it beats my wi-fi network in terms of range).  But I find that if I stray more than 15 feet or so from the base, I can notice a gradual reduction in quality, an increase in the volume of the hiss, and occasional whisps of static.  I have fiddled with the channel setting and tuning knob quite extensively, and these issues still remain.  I am probably a little pickier than the average person, but I do not consider myself an audiophile by any means -- so if *I'm* noticing the quality loss, it's pretty significant.    Now the good news:  When you are in the same room as the base and the music is loud enough to drown out the hiss, these headphones sound pretty darn good, at least to my untrained ears.  All frequencies are filled out nicely (I did not find it lacking in bass at all) and I don't get that headache-y too-much-treble feeling that I get from extended listening on lousy earbuds.    As other reviewers mentioned, it was a poor choice to put the volume knob and tuning knob right next to each other, but this is very manageable with practice.    In summary, these ain't bad for wireless headphones -- but don't let all those 5-star reviews fool you into thinking you aren't going to pay a significant price for that freedom.Edit:  Since writing the initial review, I figured out what the deal is with these.  Whether as a side effect of FM transmission or by design, somewhere along the way this device is causing a pretty aggressive automatic gain control on the signal.  A loud signal will cause the headphones to immediately adjust quieter, while they will adjust more gradually to a quiet signal, slowly bringing the level up.    This more or less ruins music that has a lot of dynamics, though *most* modern music will sound more or less okay because of the way it is mastered.  The AGC is also the cause of the infamous \\""hiss\\"" that you hear when your signal is low (it keeps boosting the signal level until you hear noise).  I find that keeping the input volume really high diminishes these problems somewhat, but of course then you have to be careful you aren't getting clipping.  And it doesn't eliminate the problems altogether.    It's a pity, because the headphones themselves sound great.  But the automatic gain control really interferes with certain music, and as a result my review stays at 3 stars."
RB2X3ORNPCEYK,4,"These headphones are a pretty good deal.  I am somewhat hard of hearing, and the television was so much of a challenge for me to hear (without blasting out the rest of the house) that I had pretty much quit watching.  I watched a show using these headphones and my wife DIDN'T complain about how loud it was,  so they worked for me. <br /> <br />The sound quality and frequency response seems pretty good (I'm a former musician, which is why I'm hard of hearing).  I found that dialing in the tuning was somewhat challenging - the sweet spot is very small.  The charger/rack is not offensive-looking and it's easy to hang up the headphones to keep them charged. <br /> <br />After watching a movie, my ears were somewhat sweaty - the foam pads don't breathe very well.  The unit otherwise seems very well-built and sturdy.  I expect these headphones to last much longer than most TV shows."
R2OVO74WZN5C24,5,They are comfortable to wear and give a good quality signal.
R2342JHKHC4NCB,5,"Bought it few months ago to use at work. I am glad for spending every penny on it !  <br />Pros: <br />- Great sound (no useless Hiss etc.) <br />- EXCELLENT reception, I could walk meters away and it would still work through multiple walls  <br />- Kept right next to the monitor and no disturbance at all <br />- recharagable <br />- LED indicators helpful <br /> <br />Cons (well not really) <br />- Big size (but its comfortable to wear) <br />- Would like better Bass (not meant regenerating Hiphop sorta bass) <br /> <br />If you want get rid of wires and still hear CLEAN sound then go for RS120"
RK302C7EBHQ92,5,"I did a lot of research in headphones before settling for these...after a while the final competitors in my list were grado labs, Bose and Sennheiser...the final parameters which would decide the purchase were Cost, tech specs and cord length. <br /> <br />Bose  QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones were the most expensive, good specs but short cord length :(...also I found the design of the headband to be flimsy. <br /> <br />Grado labs SR 80 was a good headphone, but then these were too expensive.. compared to the Senn RS120's <br /> <br />The deal amazon was offering on Sennheisers RS 120 were too appealing. The RS 120's have everything I could as for..crisp sound, amazing blend of bass and treble. (to the audiophiles ...I still prefer the Grado SR 80's, but getting senn's at $ 45 was a steal) <br /> <br />So let's re-cap: If your budget minded(Affordability+ wireless freedom + amazing sound ,but want to hear the detail audiophiles prefer from their sound systems, the RS120's are a great headphone buy.  <br /> <br />If your musical tastes include quite a bit of music with lots of bass + budget isnt constraining, a step up to the BOSE is recommended. And lastly, if you plan on listening carefully to your music and want to hear as much detail as possible from your headphones, the GRADO SR80's fill the bill!"
R1PW3I0RGKWGII,5,"I bought wireless headphones mainly for the convenience - I prefer to be able to get up and walk around without being tethered to my computer. These headphones are as good as many wired 'phones and better than my old, wired pair. The sound sparkles - no complaints in the bass, mid, or high ranges. The base/charger looks sharp and the charging method is ingenious. I can walk upstairs, downstairs, and outside and find very little interference. While I lack the experience with many other wireless sets, I can give the RS-120 a solid recommendation."
R2646JOIG27VDS,5,"I've had a number of wireless headsets and this, by far, is the best.  The package contains all the possible connectors you would need, from RCA connectors for line out feeds, to standard and minature headset jacks.  The headset itself is solid, adjusts nicely and features controls for power on/off, volume and tuning.  I wish the earcups were of the recessed type, but other than that I am very pleased with the design.  As to performance, the RS-120 reproduces both speech and music cleanly with reasonable fidelity.  They won't compare with top of the line wired headsets (costing several times more), but that's not the design intention.  There is no hiss nor whistle and I have not detected any interference with other electronic devices in my home, including a six extension 900mHz phone system.  The range is impressive and it works well even a reasonable distance outside my home.  Highly recommended -- particularly at this price point."
R1O38SKT0K8CFB,5,"Having some hearing loss I chose wireless headphones so my wife could enjoy TV at a reasonable volume.  This model was chosen due to the many rave reviews I have read and they were right-on.<br /><br />Extremely easy set-up to a TV, dish, DVD, VCR, headphones jack, or the \\""Tape-Out\\"" RCA jacks of a receiver for hearing all components.  It comes with two gold adapters and all you would need.  Easy recharge by simply setting them on the attractive charging stand; it could not be easier.  Quick tuning with no interference, 3 channels, smooth volume adjustment.  Excellent range throughout my large house; steady sound to the kitchen, bathroom, through four rooms, out in the hot tub, and up and down the stairs.  High quality stereo sound.  Sturdy, well-made, comfortable weight and earpad design.  Two replaceable, easy-to-find, long lasting AA NiMH batteries that do not develop memory when recharging after short use.<br /><br />I am very happy with this investment, and my wife is, too."
RAGSZPV496ST5,5,"I've had these for a few months now, I agree with all the praise in other reviews, great sound, long lasting charge, long range, etc. Having said that, I have a few minor gripes/suggestions for Sennheiser.<br /><br />I would like more ear cover choices, I'd prefer a soft leather instead of the foam. The foam can get a bit hot and itchy. I'd also like the sides to be thinner. I assume a lot of us wear these in bed, and you can't lay sideways with these huge headphones. And lastly, I would have prefered the connection wires to be plug-in instead of hard-wired to the back, that way I could plug it in to a stereo or satellite radio easily.<br /><br />That said, I'm happy with these and would recommend them to anyone."
R3PZDLZBIU75SJ,4,"These headphones came as advertised: <br />- High Quality/Not Flimsy <br />- Long Battery Life <br />- Clear Reception <br /> <br />I have a minor complaint about the charger -- as opposed to a previous reviewer who mentioned that getting the headphones to charge was no problem, I had to fiddle with my headphones on the charger for a while before they began charging. That said, these headphones need charging so infrequently, who cares? <br /> <br />Also, to note, I got these headphones on Amazon for ~$75 and I have noticed they are now $99 -- not sure about the reason for the price increase."
R2LYK5JTFRILE6,5,"I settled on these headphones as the result of reading many online reviews (including on CNET).  My final decision was one of price vs. performance.  These seemed to offer very good performance at a relatively good price. <br /> <br />Now that I have these and have tried them out, I can say they work great!  But please note, my application is not for music and these are the first pair of wireless headphones I have used/bought.  I use these for watching TV in bed late at night.  Previously I had trouble hearing the TV well since I had to keep the volume low due to my wife sleeping next to me and our baby in the adjacent room.  These, along with my TiVo are the perfect combination. <br /> <br />Some of the pros include the sound quality, AA rechargable batteries, and the comprehensive connectivity options.  For my case I plug them into the RCA outputs on my TiVo, but it is good to know I can also use them for other things as well.  Finally, I can sometimes hear a bit of noise/static, but it is really insignificant and I still love the sound. <br /> <br />The only con is having the tuning and volume controls too close together.  Even so, I would still buy these headphones again."
R3H3I13ME60N6O,5,"First let me say I'm not an audiophile and I use these headphones to listen to music from my stereo.  After breaking them in for a couple days, they sound excellent to my ears.  Since I'm in a college dorm, these headphones only make it about 20-25 feet until the static dominates, but that is good enough for me.  It's true that an equivalently priced corded headphone will sound better, but not having to deal with the cord (and breaking numerous headphones before due to the cord), and being able to move around while listening to music is worth it in my opinion."
R1ANUN7VFGH5A,3,I need to start out by saying that I am a huge Sennheiser fan and I believe they produce high quality products.   <br /> <br />I would have to say that these headphones are OK which is why I gave it three stars.  If you are in any way an audiophile these are not the headphones for you.  If you must have or really want a pair of wireless headphones these are the pair for you.  I tried these headphones with other wireless devices around and with no wireless devices around and I got the same results in both situations.    There is definitely a hiss in the background while you listen to these.  If you are watching a movie or TV it fine because the audio is really busy and so you don't notice the hiss but if you are listening to an audio book you definitely notice the hiss.  You can also hear the hiss when your are listening to music.  The sound quality is good but not great.  The bass is missing the mid's and trebles are OK.  I compared them side by side with other Sennheiser wired headphones and the sound is drastically better with wired headphones.  My final notes are if you absolutely must have wireless these are alright but if good quality sound is what you can't live without check out Sennheisers wonderful selection of wired headphones.
R28UBQ9SPQZTDY,1,"I own quite a few headphones by Sennheiser and in general I like them. Their price/performance ratio is hard to beat. RS-120, from the other hand, turned out to be a total disappointment. At first, there is high frequency hissing noise on all channels. At second, pads do not \\""envelope\\"" ears, they are sitting flat against them and do not reduce environment noise at all (contrary to ad). At third, charging station, while looking cute, is a pain to use. It is not easy to set headphones on it in such a way that contact is established and charging light come up. I do not recommend these headphones to anybody."
RD3C8NYGV1NGH,2,"The sound from these is very good, as long as it stays tuned in to the base which for me wasn't very long at a time. They have an analog tuner on the headphones that you tune into the frequency of the base. It was like an old car radio from the seventies and before, every time I'd turn my head I'd have to readjust them. I wasn't far from the base either, generally within 5 feet. There was a constant hiss in the background all the time also. I have a $20 cordless phone that hisses less than these did."
R20WKD37MG2VT3,4,"Hi, <br /> <br />I've been searching around the internet and am able to find these headphones starting around $59 (not including shipping). <br /> <br />I am almost ready to purchase, and last monday Amazon's price was $59.something.  I had everything in the cart and ready to buy, when the price jumped to $79.  I then stopped my order and checked froogle.com for prices elsewhere.  It is true that other stores sell them for less.  So, why the amazon price jump? <br /> <br />I've notified amazon that their price is higher than others and will wait a few days to see if they lower it again back to what it originally was. <br /> <br />Just a warning about the price. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />me"
RDA3T0LIQXWZL,5,"When I first tried these after charging them, I was very disappointed. The base would shut off unless the TV was at a loud enough volume to keep it activated, and that volume was actually louder than what I would normally listen to. Plus, there was a constant hiss like what I get from listening to radio stations on my stereo. <br /> <br />A little investigation turned up a setting on my TV that allowed me to turn off the speakers and get the audio signal going through the audio out lines only, which sent a very strong audio signal to the base, eliminating the cutouts. <br /> <br />At the same time, I also moved the base to the other side of the TV, away from the stereo. Perhaps it was a coincidence and it was really the strengthened audio signal that did it, but it completely eliminated the hiss issue and boosted the signal to where I can hear perfectly clear, strong audio throughout my home. <br /> <br />I'm thrilled to be able to tune out my neighbor's obnoxious loud music. I can also cook or do dishes in the kitchen and still hear what I'm watching without having to crank up the TV to annoying levels. <br /> <br />The headphones are very comfortable and extremely easy to use, and while I'm not an audiophile, the sound quality is amazing -- great clarity and bass. I could not be happier with the quality of these headphones."
RRIGIGQATGQQ7,5,I purchased these headphones after using (and returning) the Sony MDR RF960's and have been totally happy with the performance of the Sennheiser unit. The range is excellent and there is no hiss or distortion in the reception. The fit of the headphones is good and the ear piece is comfortable. For the price I paid ($72) there is no question this is a best buy!
R2WLG8Z82J1Z4C,4,"I researched wireless headphones having become reliant on an old and annoying Acoustics Research set that I've had for years.  When I decided on the Sennheiser RS-120s, I was interested to see how far wireless headphones have come.  Let me just say that these Sennheisers beat them hands down!  Terrific sound (for wireless) and very comfortable.  I can walk all around inside (and out) of my two story house and hear only a rare hiss.  I don't get the clicking or popping that I had with the ARs.  The hiss isn't even \\""static\\"" but a soft (and brief) hiss which occasionally comes in if my head is turned a certain way.  A slight move of the head can eliminate it.  When I'm stationary (and usually closer to the base) the sound is crystal clear.  The charging is ingenious.  Set them on the stand and they're good to go the next time.  My old ARs had a NiCad battery which never held a full charge and had a short \\""memory\\"".  These ones last for days (a hour or two a day) off the stand before I throw them back on.  So easy! <br /> <br />The ear pads are soft and extremely comfortable.  There is less \\""pinch\\"" than the cup style.  They are good headphones to wear so as to not disturb others although unlike the cup style, having them real loud will let someone next to you still be able to hear.  I have found good, clear sound at a relatively low volume.  These are perfect for late night TV, very decent for movies and music.  HOWEVER, like some of the other reviews, I sometimes have a little trouble keeping them on my head if I bend forward abruptly.  They are angled quite strangely.  I would not use these for anything strenuous.  One other thing...  A couple other reviews mention it and I have to agree that I don't understand why Sennheiser would put the tuning dial so close to the volume dial.  I have accidentally shifted the tuning when I meant to adjust the volume.  Why have the two dials so close together and for that matter, why have them on the back of the 'phones where they can be shifted when you lean up against a pillow or couch?  A rare occurence, corrected with practice but it's happened. <br /> <br />That said, unlike my old ARs, the tuning rarely needs to be adjusted.  I suggest really playing with the tuning for the first couple of days until you find the perfect channel and setting.  Then you can just leave it.  I haven't touched it since (except accidentally). By now I'm into the ease of use part.  I just put 'em on and enjoy."
R3JAL5ANL2AL43,5,"My wife and daughter have been after me to buy some wireless headphones for quite awhile because I generally stay up later than then and they are tired of hearing the TV at night.  I did some research and checked out all of my options..these seemed to be the best value for the money....Sennheiser well known for wired and wireless headphones....Well, I am QUITE happy with my purchase...it did take me a little bit to figure the tuning...to get it just right, but the sound is clear, the base is great and I can turn the volume on the TV all the way down and still listen...Highly recommend these!    UPDATE 2008: I've now had these headphones for three years.  I am still loving them.  The sound is great and it has great range.  I can walk all over my house and still hear fine though when I get to the outer fringes of the range I'll hear bursts of static from time to time."
R38DHBASHROZIJ,5,"These headphones are very good. They've started shipping adapters with the headphones, so fear no more if you have a CD player that has only a headphone jack. This should really be 4 and a half stars, because I get a constant, very soft static, but that's probably because my transmitter is right next to my wireless phone and my cell phone, along with my TV... the bass is brilliant (better than my JBL speaker system on my stereo, in fact), and the sound is generally clear. If you walk around alot, you tend to hit static spots, but those are rare and small. I strongly suggest these headphones if you want wireless; if you can use corded headphones, though, I'd suggest a set of Sennheiser corded headphones (no static)."
R27UVIL53PXDMK,2,"These are decent enough headphones.  They sound good although I detect a slight hiss.  I didn't find them uncomfortable at all although they can slip off when I tilt my head too far forward.  However, I can't use them at work at all.  There is a constant rhythmic clicking even when no audio signal is present.  I have tried to track down the source of interference but to no avail.  It is not my computer, monitor or telephone as I have tried powering all these down.  I tried tuning on all three channels.  The online FAQ is of no help.  As work is where I intended to use them, they are useless to me.  Bottom line: they work acceptably well some places but not everywhere.  Be forewarned that they may not work at all where you need them.  The Sony headphones, also 900 mHz, do not have this problem although the reception is not as good."
R1A9WNXLNDSYK,3,Had hoped for more with these. They worked fine and sounded very nice but there is very little in the way of adjustments. Just the extension of each ear piece. But the angle and curvature could not be adjusted so they always seemed off kilter. Spoiloed by my Grado's maybe? <br /> <br />
R112UE13TO1SV8,1,"I bought these because I have Sennheiser HD212 headphones which I found to be great. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the quality of these wireless phones is great only if you are in a very close proximity to the base. Additional noises, clicks etc. start to appear only 10 feet away, 25 feet away the quality is really bad (no walls or anything else in between, maximum volume fed into the base for higher signal level). Also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head. I live in a area in a city with 4-5 story tall old appartment buildings around. Changing the channels does not help. While tuning the headphones you can also get to a phone conversations and other communications."
R1XXLOXN1EXDID,5,"When I first noticed this product on an Amazon best-seller list, my initial response was \\""what a great idea.\\"" My second was \\""sounds too good to be true.\\"" My third, after receiving my order and slipping these headphones on for the first time, was simply \\""WOW!\\""    From the elegant, ergonamic design to the superb sound, the Sennheiser RS-120s can't be beat.    The headphones come with three connection adapters, so they'll work with just about any TV, radio, stereo, DVD or game system. The base unit is small, inobtrusive and leaves a small enough footprint that you can find a spot for it just about anywhere.    But the bottom line is they work -- and they work well. I have them set up in my bedroom and connected to my TV so I can unwind late at night without keeping my spouse awake. And on Saturday afternoons I can have the game on with the volume pumped up without a peep of complaint from her or the kids (and even if they did, I'd never hear them anyway :-) Of course, I can walk around and do chores, work at my desk, whatever, without missing a second of the action.    The rechargable batteries are a great idea, too. No need to plug a cord in, simply place the headphones on the base unit metal rack to connect and charge effortlessly.    My personal standard for consumer testing is whether or not I can rip open the package and get the product working without having to reference the instructions or manual. No worries there ... just plug and play ... and so intuitive it can't get any easier.    Form, functionality and unbelievably cool, too. An unbeatable combination."
RWD8MB88TBUUG,5,"I am in awe.  I suffer from moderate hearing loss and tinnitus.  When I put on the headphones I could not believe it.  The sound is magnificent.  If a pin drops on the show you are watching, you will hear it!  When I first listened, I thought someone was in my home with me because difference sounds seem to come from all over!  The headphones are light-weight, comfortable to wear; they sit on a charger which plugs into the wall and into the audio out on the back of the tv.  I thought the Plasma was great sound; these headphones allow me to hear sounds and words I never could before!  BUY THEM.  No sense in paying any more for headphones.  I don't know how these can be topped."
R3VUWEKCAJX2DR,5,"I'm going to keep it nice and simple. I bought this headphone a week ago here on Amazon and LOVE it! It has exceeded my expectations.  <br /> <br />1. it's very light and the ear pods are very comfortable. the headphones are well balanced once worn. <br />2. the battery life is great! I charged it the full 24 hours initially and am now going to use it until it completely drains. Three of these cycles should ensure the best battery performance as memory effect will be reduced in subsequent chargings. <br />3. the range so far has been great. I can use it all over my house without any deadspots. I've even gone to the end of the driveway without any problems....soon I'll try farther out to see what she/he can do! <br />4. I have not had any of the interference issues some have had, but it can be easily corrected with a frequency adjustment <br />5. All in all, I think this is one of the best items I've ever bought on Amazon and I find myself using it all the time."
ROFWIZE4TE2OX,5,The Sennheiser RS-120 headphones far exceeded my expectations; I could not believe how crisp the sound was for this wireless set and you just cannot beat the price for this type of quality. These headphones have great (perfect to me ears) sound throughout my house/garage with absolutely no noise interference. Have previously purchased 'more expensive' Sony Wireless set and I was very disappointed with quality of headphones and the amount of noise interference. I also liked the design of the headphone base/recharger; sturdy yet small enough to be inconspicous.
R1MW4JDMBCP2E2,5,I have had these headphones for about a month or so now and I have been 100% impressed.  These headphones sound increadable no matter where you are in your home.  You can go quite a distance and still hear every note.
R10X627S4N14JT,5,"This is my first set of wireless headphones, and I am very glad I spent the extra money. I recently purchased an iBook, and wanted some wireless headphones to go with it, so I could sit around the house with my iBook. As a fifteen year old with no job and a very tight wallet, I wasnt looking for something DJ quality, but I didnt want a poor product, which is true for pretty much all mainstream consumers. <br /> <br />I keep all of my music on my iPod, so I dont fill up space on my ibook. My iPod sits in its dock upstairs and charges while the transmitter, which sends out a radio frequency, is held up on the wall by a hook. Unlike previous reviewers, my headphones shipped with all necessary adapters to plug into anything. The headphones, which come with rechargable batteries, is very easy to charge. All I have to do is set them on top of the receiver, which has two metal bars on them that charge it. No wires, nothing. <br /> <br />I found these headphones to be very comfortable, which is saying something because I have a huge head, around 8 hat size. <br />They feel very solid, with no likelihood of breaking. <br /> <br />The sound quality is excellent. I am a big classic rock fan, so its great to be grooving to The Who with thumping bass lines and with a great overall sound quality. <br /> <br />My only concern with these headphones is that sometimes, it seems randomly, I get static. I was 15 ft away from the transmitter and I got some static, but then I have been over 200 ft away from transmitter with absolutely no static. I probably just need to fine tune it more. <br /> <br />Overall, I am very happy with these headphones, and at this price, an outstanding deal. I would not recommend these to frequent travelers, as the transmitter needs to be plugged in, so they are impossible to use on an airplane. However, they are wonderful for people like me, who dont travel nearly as much, but love music. A 5-star product."
R2VKHBO4326EB0,4,"These headphones work great. They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.    The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).    I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.     Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.    As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.    For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a \\""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter\\"". Make sure the adapter is a \\""stereo\\"" adapter versus a \\""mono\\"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.     I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.    Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick \\""What to do\\"":  Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):  1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.  2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.    NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)  The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)    Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.    If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.    Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They're pretty nice."
R2QYXHQ71MQXR2,4,"I have this habit of getting up early in the morning well before my wife and was getting tired of having to keep the volume down on the family room TV before she got up.  So I was just looking to use these headphones for TV use.  However, out of curiosity, I walked up stairs and clear across the other side of our house and outside of some occassional hissing, the signal was still strong.  Given my intended use, signal strength, clarity, ease of use and value were the primary critieria and the RS-120 has met or exceeded my expectations for each of these criteria.    Just a few other comments: 1. The comments of how you need to retract the headphones to allow for charging is true, but this really isn't a big deal in my opinion, and is more than compensated for by the ease of the charging mechanism which simply requires you to set the headphones down on the base.  2. The receiver automatically turns on when it receives a signal and turns off after a few minutes if the signal stops.  This was a pain when I paused a movie for a while and had to turn the TV off and on again to get the headphones restarted.  I'm not sure why simply turning the movie back on didn't do the trick since it resulted in a new signal????  However, the upside of this set up is that you don't always have to remember to turn off the base unit on your own.  3. The headphones have it's own on/off switch.  4. There's a volume and fine tuning adjustment on the headphone that can easily be adjusted without taking them off your head.  The set up is very intuitive.  5. Contrary to some other reviews, the pair that I received came with two adapters that allowed for easy connection to a standard headphone outlet or computer.    Bottom line, I did a lot of research before purchasing the RS-120 and I am still very satisfied.  Unless you want to spend a lot more money, everyone should feel comfortable with this option."
R2TIT36LSR73IP,4,"Not perfect headphones, but I suspect near perfect for wireless headphones.  Great range, sound is very good, except for a slight buzz in one area near the wall when I turn my head at just the right angle (interference from the house wiring??).  The headphones hooked right into the back of my surround sound and I can mute the TV sound (when my wife is reading) and can turn up my headphones full blast - great advantage when she doesn't want to hear the television (or I don't want to hear her)."
R2DSX65X4SVNA8,4,"I got these because my hearing is failing, so I can't comment on frequency range ... I use them from my Tivo ... worked as advertised and my wife is much happier (no blaring TV)... reception is great in house ... even passable reception in my all steel shop 50 feet from house ... I can now hear the audio clearly of the shows I watch and the background music (didn't know there was so much) ... only critisism is that the earphones are pretty much a fixed position, not much adjustment and fall off if I bend over.<br /><br />update August 2009 ... replaced the rechargeable batteries this year ... simple .<br />these Sennheiser RS120s are still serving me well ...<br />sointantly getting my money's worth !:o)"
R3B6M1IGMY54UA,5,"This is my 3rd pair of wireless headphones.  Had Sony RF-930s and some RCAs before that.  Both broke in short order and although these Sennheiser's may do the same down the road, they work MUCH better than either of my previous two pairs.  Can move around the house with no static.  No constantly adjusting the signal.  It's amazing.  They actually work.  For the 40% off deal amazon has going on these, they're a steal. <br /> <br />OK, they don't come with a headphone adapter.  I happened to have a RCA to phono plug adapter around and used it.  Suppose it would be nice if Sennheiser had included this, especially considering the list price.  And the \\""manual\\"" is pretty much non-existent.  They could have done a better job with that. <br /> <br />Long term we'll have to see how they hold up.  Short term though, if you have *realistic* expectations (they are wireless headphones, after all) you should be pleased."
RDEZ7BEWK512O,2,"This is my first wireless headphone purchase so I can't say if the problems I experienced are inherent in all wireless headphones or are unique to these phones.  Nor can I say for sure if there was interference specific to my home.  I certainly am no audiophile but I have to say I was disappointed in my overall listening experience.  There is a very distinct humming sound in the headphones.  It is particularly  noticeable during periods of silence.  I found the playback quality of the music to be acceptable, but the crackle and humming very annoying.  I tried to no avail, to tune the noise out by changing to each of the three available channels.  Of course the music drowns out the background noise but the silent portions of a track or album are often a significant part of the overall listening experience."
R32VYTJ8VSQBEQ,5,"I bought these beautiful sounding set a few days ago from J&R and its absolutely wonderful! I got the whole set with the adaptors and stuff exactly like the way you see in the package. Seems like some of you did not get the everything like you should have in the package. Check the supplier of your headphones 'cause you should get everything like mentioned, or else strangle them! :-) <br /> <br />Anyways, I'm using this headphones at work and even worked it at home with my home theatre setup. All I can say that it sounds awesome and better than most corded phones. The base is very nice, and so is the overall dynamics. I've used other headsets before, but this one is the best sounding one. Yes, you do get occasional drop on the frequency if you walk too far (expected), but considering you are within a 10-20 feet radius from the base it sounds perfect! I have heavy duty electronic stuff all over the place at home, but this unit still worked flawlessly without a hiss. Love it!"
R1IWJY7GSBY7D8,4,"These things work even in my electronic cesspool of a house. My roomates are noisy; cordless phones, wireless router, cell phones, TV, audio, multiple computers and the worst screamer of all -- the 2.4GHz heating/air conditioning unit. Even within this challenging environment, these headphones sound good as long as I stay within 20 feet of the transmitter. Outside of that they slug it out with the others. Although as far away as 50 feet, I can settle down on my bed, taking care to hold my head still, and only occasionally hear a hissy-fit. <br /> <br />Yea, the audio is pretty good although not excellent. Yea, they are distance challenged at least in my environment. But hey, they are nearly cheap and some of the best performing wireless headphones around. I'm keeping these until a new generation of perfect wireless headphones arrives, whenever that be. They definitely solve the problem of listening without disturbing others and give you some freedom to listen and roam. <br /> <br />Be mindful that there are several adjustments to make. First, there is the channel selector on the included base unit. Secondly, there is a thumb wheel on the right side ear piece that fine tunes the signal. I believe that other reviewers who could not get these to work didn't understand these adjustments. <br /> <br />This is a weird product to review because it is both flawed and solved the problem."
R13NHQ7WBZVUWG,3,"I just received these phones, and for some reason, they don't ship with the 3.5 mm headphone jack and 6.3 mm adaptor as pictured in the pdf manual, but rather with a paired RCA cable attached, and no adaptor of any kind.  These were useless to me with my current stereo."
R2D6UM9QN5HBC2,3,"I have a simmilar Sennheiser model and have found them to perform eratically. Sometimes they don't find signal and it can be most annoying. We had an old cheaper set from another manufacturer that worked great just didn't take an unexpected drop very well(oops). So we bought the Sennheiser based on reviews at the time. Sound quality is good, when it works though.<br /><br />To Magic!! I have a Sony XS955 TV set and it's the Sony's fault why the headphones don't work. It states in the Sony manual that you need to TURN OFF the internal speakers for the line out output to work. What was Sony thinking?? They even sell wireless headphones, and never tested their sets with them. Grrrr. NOT ADA Approved!"
R29181SD2I62PU,2,"My wife has a chronic illness that makes it difficult for her to go to sleep, so she usually watches TV until she drops off. I recently bought a Sony KDF50WE655 HDTV for the bedroom and bought these headphones for her to use so I can get some sleep. They don't work with the TV regardless of the base station channel selection. Although there is no mention in the Amazon listing for the headphones, the minimal user manual notes that they will not work if connected to some TVs. I tried it with extra long cables to get the transmitter away from the TV but still just static. I have tried it with my iPod and with a stand alone CD/DVD player and it works fine with them."
RK9H195473Q6M,5,"After researching Sony, RCA, and Sennheiser wireless headphones I settled on the Sennheiser RS-120's and I have no regrets. These are excellent headphones. I ended up buying them at GoogGuys. When I asked the associate if I could try them he connected them to a DVD player and they came to life. I walked all the way accross the store filled with electronics and heard no interference what-so-ever. I was nothing short of impressed and bought them right then and there.  <br /> <br />Now that I have been using them for several weeks I am still amazed by them. I didn't know wireless headphones could be this good. There is no interference around my house. The 300ft range claim is about right. Maybe a bit conservative. I can mow my rental house lawn accross the street and even go next door and still get a good signal.  <br /> <br />Sound quality is excellent. Bass is strong, mids are prominent, and highs are crisp. These phones work great for music, TV, and movies. I couldn't be happier with the sound. There is some spotty static in a couple places upstairs but it is practically inaudible when listening to something.  <br /> <br />I don't know how long the batteries last because they have never run out. I have worn them for almost 10 hours straight and they were still going strong. I put them on the charger after each use and they have never shown any signs of a low battery.  <br /> <br />That brings me to the charging system. It is simply superb. Unlike most other wireless phone charging systems this one is very simple. Just set the headphones on the metal \\""tube\\"" that sticks out of the base and it charges. No messing around to get them just right so the contacts will contact (AKA Sony).  <br /> <br />Build quality is very good. They are light weight, yet sturdy. The RS-120's are much sturdier than any of the other Sennheiser RS phones. They are very comfortable as well. I was worried that, due to their open air, on the ear design that they would get uncomfortable after wearing them for a few hours. I was proven wrong. They have never become uncomfortable.  <br /> <br />I have read some reviews where people complain that the base turns off whenever it wants. It has an auto-off features so that it shuts off if it gets not signal for a few minutes. I see no problem with that and it has never bothered me since I'm usually listening to something when I'm wearing them. :)  <br /> <br />I have the base connected to my home theater receiver to which I have a TV, DVD player, and my PC connected. The phones work well with all of those sources. Games, music, movies, TV, everything sounds great and I recommend these phones whole heartedly. You would be hard pressed to find a better deal in this price range."
R11ZPJTQCH6X9O,4,headphones are good. was able to walk around the entire apartment with the signal being strong with an occational static now and then. was able to walk all the way to the dumpster which is like half a block away and still was able to hear the signal(although weakly).. only shortcoming i can think of is that the set cannot handle much base. i think the static depends on what kind of applilances you have around the house. things like TVs and radios and monitors affect the signal.
R3SSIY97DP01TT,3,"Headphones work great, but it's missing a part.  The jack that connects you to your unit of preference.  (...)"
R1133KUY4BUQLT,4,"I bought these today (early September, 2004), and I'm pretty happy with them.  The headphones themselves are light and fit well.. and the sound (to these non-audiophile ears) is good.  There's excellent high frequency definition and good, solid bass without distortion.    There was no trouble in setting them up... plug them in and away they went (I had all the required adaptors and plugs in the box).  I needed to tweak the headset-based tuning knob a bit, but since then it's been rock steady. I've had none of the drop-off or position-sensitive behaviour which I've read in other reviews.  Still...it's early days and who knows what will happen when I start exploring the nether regions of the house and yard!    The thing I really want is a second set of headphones so that someone else can share the music or movie.  I'm assured that they ARE avalable, but don't have a price yet.    So far, so good!      November update:    After a couple of months, I'm still happy with the sound.  However, I HAVE discovered those annoying interfence sounds appear sometimes when I move around.  Things get worse in my single story, metal roof house if it's raining.. in fact, at the moment I'm sitting at my desk about 15m from the transmitter, it's wet outside and there's an irritating level of intermittent interference.  But I suspect that's just physics - maybe not even Sennheiser can do much about it!    Anyway.. we use them all the time, and they still sound good, so I'm retaining my 4-star rating.    July 2006 update:  It's nearly 2 years since I bought these headphones.  I have them on at the moment - very loud - listening to to Roger Waters' \\""In the Flesh\\"" DVD.  They're still working well - the sound remains terrific.  Friends who've been visited me have tried them and remarked on the quality of the sound.  One of my better buys.  I use them at least 2 - 3 times / week.    November 2009 Update:  Still going strong!  I'm listening to the Eagles Farewell I concert DVD (recorded righthere in Melbourne, Australia!) as I write this using these great headphones.  I use them at least once a week and they still sound great.  So what's that.. 5 years?  In the meantime I bought some Philips equivalents to use while exercising on my treadmill (a VERY short-term thing!) and they, in comparison, are junk.  So, hats off to Sennheiser."
R38SCP80NUMB46,4,"I have had these headphones for a few months now, and I can't believe how my life has changed because of them.  Maybe it's the concept of the wireless UHF headphones itself that I'm stoked with, but I find these to be great!  The sound quality is amazing when I am watching TV or listening to my stereo, and I prefer to watch DVDs with them, so that I can get the full stereo effect.  I tried some infra red ones before buying these, and they did not compare IN ANY WAY except price.   <br /> <br />Having these means that I can listen to my music or TV without disturbing my girlfriend, and the range permits me to even go outside and wash the car listening to them. <br /> <br />Cons include: <br />a bit bulky, which means that you can't lie on your side with the head phones on (can't imagine any that you can do this with mind you) but that's it. <br /> <br />In response to other reviews: <br /> <br />The issue with charging them when the ears are extended, I found the same thing, but hardly found this a problem (certainly not one worth rating these only one star) <br />I haven't encountered a problem with the auto shut off or the rechargable battery life or quality.  Sure there's a bit of interference at times, but it's hardly noticeable when the volume is even remotely up. <br /> <br />I guess some people are harder to please than others. <br />I would 100% recommend these if for no reason than to reduce conflict in relationships! <br /> <br />"
RHLTA1WTPMEV6,3,"This was my first set of wireless headphones.  I've been looking for a while for a set to use at the computer because I dislike the wires running all over from my current headphones.  I would say that these headphones are OK, but not great.  <br />Pros:<BR>&gt; I'm no audiophile, but the sound was pretty good to me.  Better than my cheapo corded headphones.<BR>&gt; The &quot;hook&quot; charging system is nice, don't have to muck with some tiny connector to make sure it's charging, just drop them on the hook.<br />Cons:<BR>&gt; My main gripe is that when there is no music playing you can hear a constant low hiss.  I tried all three frequencies to no avail.  Maybe this was due to interference in my home?  Don't know for sure.<br />&gt;The headphones come with stereo &quot;RCA&quot;-type output jacks, not a headphone jack.  This would probably be nice if you're using it for a home stereo but my computer only has headphone jacks so I had to buy some adapters.<br />&gt; I found the headphones to be somewhat uncomfortable.  I have a somewhat large head (hat size ~7 5/8) but after about 1/2 hour or so these weren't very comfy.<br />Overall these are decent headphones, just not what I'm looking for."
ROZCCENTKS20L,1,"I lived in Europe in 2003 and purchased a pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones there that I really liked--they were a little more expensive than this pair, but worked great. Unfortunately, they worked on 220V, and I didn't really have room anyhow, so sold them when I moved back to the US in 2004. I bought these as a replacement, but they were NO replacement!<br />Here's the problems I encountered:<br />(a) No RCA-&gt;mini plug adapter is included, as another reviewer states. Funnily enough, the box DOES say it is included! Who has RCA jacks for headphones? If anything the default should be a mini-plug, with an included adapter to RCAs. (Scratching head...)<br />(b) Interference. Always present. Even from 10 feet away. Moving around helps, but you end up having to hold your head in the &quot;perfect&quot; position.... not feasible. My old pair worked great, didn't have this stupid manual tuning knob these do, and had almost no interference (until I got a significant distance away).<br />(c) Standard NiMH batteries are included, BUT with a caveat. This is a good thing in general, because my old set came with 2 batteries, but they were 'custom' and probably not ideal in that regard (but you could charge 1 set while listening; you can't do that with these!). The caveat is, they included the absolute cheapest nimh battieries they could find, GP 600mAHs. If you DO buy this, make sure to replace those with some 1500mAH+ ones (that should only cost a few bucks).<br />(d) The on-hook charging is picky. If you adjust the headphones to make them larger (pulling down the ear parts), sometimes it won't charge when it goes back on the hook. How silly is that?? It shouldn't be finicky. The older ones I had also had problems with engaging the charge mechanism when put on-hook, and it was an ENTIRELY different design. So, this is the SECOND design Sennheiser has screwed up. (If you don't adjust the size, it works fine though. So you'd better have a small head.)<br />(e) Probably the worst thing: Auto-shutoff. Hey! A great feature right? The base station shuts itself off if it doesn't sense audio for a while... for example, if you pause a DVD or TV, to go to the bathroom, or whatever. When you come back, you'll notice the base station has autoshutoff, but the headphones haven't, so they will be squealing SUPER LOUDLY since there is no signal coming from the transmitter. Brilliant! I bet if you fall asleep during a DVD without music on the menu, it would return to the menu, transmitter shuts off, and I wouldn't be surprised if you could get hearing damage from this &quot;feature&quot;.<br />I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I won't be buying another Sennheiser product (I owned the previous wireless pair, I own a noise-canceling pair that I'm pretty happy with, and I have a 80s-era wired pair in storage somewhere). None of them have been perfectly designed, but the others at least had good sound quality to make up for it. This product failed on every account, and convinced me that their designs just aren't worth &quot;putting up with&quot; for the sound quality. I'll seek out another manufacturer."
R2H25H8F1Y49S7,4,"I've only had this headset for about a week, but I've been able to listen to it quite a bit, and so far, I like what I hear.  It took only five minutes to set up, and when I first turned it on, I was amazed how clear the sound was, especially for wireless.  I was able to hear quieter parts of my favorite songs, which on my computer speakers I was never able to hear.  The only bad part about this headset is that you can't go too far from the receiver without hearing loud clicks and static.  I went outside no more than 150 feet from the receiver and I could barely even hear the music over the static.  Overall, I'd say buy this headset if you are planning on staying within 50 feet or so of the music source the majority of the time you would use the headset.   When you are close to the receiver, the sound quality is great, especially when you look at how cheap this headset is compared to other similar headsets."
